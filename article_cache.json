        "body": "CNN \u2014\n\n2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon.\n\nEarlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It\u2019s due to set sail in February 2025.\n\nWith stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, \u201cThe Big Nude Boat\u201d is billed as a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d with amenities designed to \u201cfit everyone\u2019s style of bare cruising.\u201d\n\nAnd couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area.\n\nThe news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach.\n\n\u201cNudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Nudist explains what you should definitely not do at a nude beach 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.\n\n\u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d\n\nWhile clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era.\n\nDuring the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d\n\nChanneling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.\n\nOne of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world.\n\nAnd their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:\n\nPlaya Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay\n\nLocated about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay\u2019s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.\n\nPhotogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand\u2019s allure.\n\nAfter decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.\n\nSince then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort.\n\nPlaya Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay\n\nNida Nude Beach, Lithuania\n\nThe chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off.\n\nWith its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.\n\nWalk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.\n\nNida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania\n\nAgesta Beach, Sweden\n\nSweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.\n\nBased in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city.\n\nOpen from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available.\n\nAgesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden\n\nLittle Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand\n\nLittle Palm Beach is situated on Waiheke Island in New Zealand. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAlthough it\u2019s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation\u2019s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.\n\nReaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island\u2019s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.\n\nYou can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke\u2019s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.\n\nLittle Palm Beach, Miro Road, Waiheke Island 1081, New Zealand\n\nNugal Beach, Croatia\n\nFlanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Bra\u010d island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.\n\nBe sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair \u2014 like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.\n\nNugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tu\u010depi.\n\nNugal Beach, 21300 Makarska, Croatia\n\nMoshup Beach, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts\n\nMoshup Beach can be found on the west side of Martha's Vineyard. Loop Images/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty Images\n\nPerched at the island\u2019s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).\n\nLocated right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.\n\nMoshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island\u2019s private nude beach.\n\nMoshup Beach, 71 Moshup Trail, Aquinnah, MA 02535\n\nBlack\u2019s Beach, La Jolla, California\n\nSet beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State\u2019s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.\n\nLong, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from La Jolla Farms Road or the Citizens Trail from Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego.\n\nBlack\u2019s Beach, Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, San Diego, CA 92037\n\nLady Bay Beach, Sydney, Australia\n\nLady Bay Beach was first granted legal status in 1976. Evelyn Proimos/Flickr\n\nAlthough it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)\n\nPerched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it\u2019s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.\n\nThe rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.\n\nLady Bay Beach, Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney, Australia\n\nBuhne 16, Sylt, Germany\n\n\u201cGrin and bare it\u201d might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).\n\nTechnically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.\n\nIt\u2019s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.\n\nBuhne 16, Listlandstr 133b, 25980 Kampen (Sylt), German\n\nWreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada\n\nBilled as one of the world\u2019s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.\n\nWith the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.\n\nEvergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.\n\nWreck Beach, Vancouver, British Columbia; Canada\n\nRed Beach, Crete, Greece\n\nThis secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.\n\nNamed after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront.\n\nPioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni\u2019s that\u2019s renowned for its mojitos.\n\nNote: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.\n\nRed Beach, Matala, Crete 702 00, Greece\n\nCallantsoog Beach, Netherlands\n\nCallantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.\n\nSituated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.\n\nIts designated nudist section is marked between two poles.\n\nThose keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe.\n\nCallantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands\n\nAnse de Grande Saline, St. Barts\n\nWhile the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.)\n\nAnse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.\n\nL\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over.\n\nAnse de Grande Saline, St. Barth\u00e9lemy\n\nPlatja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain\n\nSet between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza\u2019s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.\n\nHowever nude sunbathers aren\u2019t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you\u2019ll see pacing in the background aren\u2019t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.\n\nPlatja des Cavallet, 07818, Balearic Islands, Spain\n\nLittle Beach, Maui, Hawaii\n\nLittle Beach -- a clothing-optional beach in Maui's Makena State Park. Shutterstock\n\nFlanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you didn\u2019t take your clothes off. Like many such beaches, going sans swimsuit is not officially sanctioned here and citations are possible.\n\nPart of Makena State Park on the island\u2019s southeast coast, the beach overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.\n\nGnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.\n\nAdditionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets.\n\nLittle Beach, Makena State Park, Makena Rd, Kihei, HI 96753, USA\n\nCap d\u2019Agde beach, France\n\nCap d'Agde -- an iconic nudist resort town in Southern France. Shutterstock\n\nSometimes called the \u201cNaked City,\u201d Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village is the world\u2019s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season.\n\nVisitors are free to be naked wherever they want \u2013 restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).\n\nNon residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.\n\nCap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village, Rond-Point du Bagnas, 34300 Agde, France\n\nIs Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy\n\nSituated along Sardinia\u2019s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment.\n\nThe idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years.\n\nMayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future.\n\n\u201cWe have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,\u201d Tedeschi told CNN. \u201cAnd then we thought, let\u2019s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.\u201d\n\nThe beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby.\n\nIs Benas Beach, Province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy\n\nMpenjati Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nMpenjati Beach was awarded official nudist beach status in 2014. Rajesh Jantilal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s only official nude beach \u2013 and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent \u2013 is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.\n\nIts legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.\n\nLocal clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation.\n\nMpenjati Nature Reserve, Palm Beach, Port Edward, South Africa\n\nPlaya Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico\n\nZipolite Beach in Mexican is tolerant of nude sunbathing. Shutterstock\n\nLive your \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal were shot on location.\n\nPioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn\u2019t legal here.)\n\nWhile the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy.\n\nPlaya Zipolite, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico\n\nMetsoke Dragot, Israel\n\nFloat nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.\n\nPerhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour\u2019s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline.\n\nPrimitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.\n\nMetsoke Dragot, Highway 90, Dead Sea, Israel\n\nPraia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil\n\nNaturist beach Praia Massarandupi\u00f3 in Bahia. Fred Schinke/Flickr\n\nThe string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.\n\nA two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.\n\nPraia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil\n\nSpiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy\n\nSpiaggia de Guvano has been popular with nude bathers since the 1960s. Shutterstock\n\nLocated on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think \u201cSwept Away \u201d \u2013 the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller.)\n\nAdding to the beach\u2019s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via kayak or motorboat or hiking down a steep and somewhat treacherous trail that involves scrambling over rocks.\n\nGuvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit.\n\nThe beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.\n\nSpiaggia di Guvano, 19018 Vernazza, SP, Italy\n\nVecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia\n\nEdged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.\n\nBased close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it\u2019s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section.\n\nThe zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that\u2019s a big hit with local residents.\n\nVecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia\n\nHaulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida\n\nThe most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.\n\nThe clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.\n\nGiven the stellar weather in south Florida, there\u2019s usually someone in the buff on any given day.\n\nBut the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.\n\nHaulover Beach Park, 10800 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33154\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated and republished in May 2024.",

        "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, \u201cRemember When?\u201d is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRemember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?\n\nAs the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.\n\nAnd no one has conquered it quite like Moss.\n\nSome 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.\n\nUntil, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.\n\nPete Doherty and Kate Moss are seen at the Glastonbury Music Festival 2005. MJ Kim/Getty Images\n\nMatching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.\n\nThe images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.\n\nIn the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).\n\nSuddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.\n\nThe Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBy 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.\n\nOnce prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.\n\nAnd to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.",

        "title": "Disney heiress, wealthy Democratic donors say they won't finance the party until Joe Biden drops out",
        "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden walks to deliver remarks after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's bid for immunity from federal prosecution for 2020 election subversion, at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 1, 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is facing an uprising from some his own party's wealthy donors, including an heiress to the Disney family fortune, who say they will no longer fund the Democratic Party until Biden drops out of the presidential race following his disastrous debate performance.\n\nAbigail Disney, the granddaughter to Roy O. Disney, who cofounded The Walt Disney Company, told CNBC on Thursday that she plans to withhold donations to the party she has funded for years until Biden drops out. The president has said he has no plans to withdraw from the race, despite calls for him to do so.\n\n\"I intend to stop any contributions to the party unless and until they replace Biden at the top of the ticket. This is realism, not disrespect. Biden is a good man and has served his country admirably, but the stakes are far too high,\" Abigail Disney said in a lengthy statement to CNBC. \"If Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose. Of that I am absolutely certain. The consequences for the loss will be genuinely dire.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party at large has been in a state of panic since Biden struggled to perform in the debate against former President Donald Trump last week. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, called on Biden to drop out of the race, suggesting the debate performance proved to voters that the president is incapable of taking on Trump and unable to overcome his distance in the polls.\n\nA New York Times/Sienna College poll taken after the debate showed Biden behind Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters.\n\nRepresentatives for the Biden campaign did not return requests for comment.\n\nAbigail Disney has been a longtime supporter of Democrats. She gave $50,000 to the Jane Fonda Climate political action committee in April, according to a Federal Election Commission filing. The PAC has given $35,000 to Democrats running for congressional seats, according to data from OpenSecrets.\n\nDisney gave $150,000 in 2014 to Planned Parenthood Votes, a PAC affiliated with the health care nonprofit, according to OpenSecrets. That PAC this election cycle has spent over $400,000 supporting Democrats, including $26,000 for Biden.\n\nDisney pointed to Vice President Kamala Harris as a solid alternative to Biden, arguing she'd be able to defeat Trump.\n\n\"We have an excellent Vice President. If Democrats would tolerate any of her perceived shortcomings even one tenth as much as they have tolerated Biden's (and let's not kid ourselves about where race and gender figure in that inequity) and if Democrats can find a way to stop quibbling and rally around her, we can win this election by a lot,\" Disney said.\n\nAnd she's not the only one pausing gifts until Biden steps down. Gideon Stein, the president of the Moriah Fund, said he's decided to pause planned donations of $3.5 million, earmarked for nonprofits and political organizations aligned with the presidential race.\n\n\"Joe Biden has been a very effective president, but unless he steps aside my family and I are pausing on more than $3 million in planned donations to nonprofits and political organizations aligned with the presidential race, with the exception of some down ballot work,\" Stein said. \"Virtually every major donor I've talked to believes that we need a new candidate in order to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nKarla Jurvetson, a philanthropist and major Democratic donor, hinted as recently as Tuesday in a private donor call that she agrees with the sentiment on pausing donations until Biden steps down and could end up making such move, according to a person familiar with her remarks. The person was granted anonymity in order to speak freely about a private conversation.\n\nA spokesman for Jurvetson did not return repeated requests for comment.\n\nJurvetson is among the top 50 donors this cycle across the country, donating over $5 million to Democrats, according to OpenSecrets. She's given over $200,000 to the Biden Victory Fund this cycle, according to FEC records.\n\nJurvetson gave over $30 million to Democrats in 2020, according to the data.",

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report, to be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, to show growth of 200,000, down from the 272,000 reported for May.\n\nIn historical terms, the pace of job gains is still solid. But there are signs bubbling underneath that conditions could be getting softer and possibly pointing at broader economic weakness down the road.\n\n\"This is a report that's coming at a point where there's a little more uncertainty about the economic landscape than there has been in a few months,\" said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \"Specifically, I'm thinking more about the unemployment rate, which has been slowly trending up.\"\n\nThe jobless level in May did nudge higher to 4%, the first time it hit that threshold since January 2022, up from 3.7% a year ago. The forecast is for the rate to hold there.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a 4% unemployment rate would be cause for celebration, not concern. However, what is catching the eye of some economists is where the rate is now compared with where it's been over the past year.\n\nThe May rate was 0.5 percentage point above its 12-month low of 3.5% in July 2023, potentially triggering a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule. The rule has shown consistently that whenever the unemployment rate on a three-month average eclipses its 12-month low by half a percentage point, the economy is in recession.",

        "body": "Labour leader Keir Starmer visits Burton and South Derbyshire College on June 27, 2024 in Burton upon Trent, United Kingdom. Cameron Smith | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Britain elected its first Labour prime minister in 14 years, with an expected landslide victory for the opposition party during the July 4 elections. Keir Starmer takes the country's top job from Rishi Sunak with projections suggesting his left-of-center party could have a majority of around 170 seats. Starmer, 61, has had a rapid political ascent after entering U.K. parliament less than a decade ago. But many Britons still know little about the man who has positioned himself as the country's change candidate. CNBC takes a look at the U.K.'s new prime minister and his platform.\n\nHuman rights lawyer-turned-politician\n\nStarmer was born in 1962 in London, England, to a father who worked as a toolmaker and a mother who worked as a nurse. The 61-year-old has often referenced his modest beginnings as a point of connection with British voters and says his mother's lifelong battle with a severe illness gave him a deep gratitude for the National Health Service (NHS). Starmer was the first in his family to go to university, studying law at the University of Leeds. After postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford, Starmer began working as a barrister \u2014 or British trial attorney \u2014 in 1987, taking on high-profile cases, including against Shell, McDonald's and former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's mine closures.\n\nwatch now\n\nStarmer also served as a human rights adviser during former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's landmark Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement. In 2008, a year after marrying his wife, Victoria, Starmer became director of public prosecutions, putting him at the head of the U.K.'s Crown Prosecution Service. Starmer was knighted in 2014 for his services to criminal justice and was elected to Parliament the following year, serving as immigration minister and Brexit minister for the opposition. In 2020, he was appointed Labour leader and instigated a major overhaul of the party after the resignation of Jeremy Corbyn, who led the faction to record loss in the 2019 election.\n\nIn his 2024 election campaign, Starmer touted a \"decade of national renewal\" for the country following what Labour has described as years of spending cuts and falling living standards under the Tories. In the party's election manifesto, published last month, Starmer outlined spending measures to create a new publicly owned energy company, reduce NHS waiting times, build new homes and renationalize rail services.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer gives a speech as he visits the Vale Inn on June 27, 2024 in Macclesfield, United Kingdom. Cameron Smith | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBut he also positioned himself as staunchly pro-business, continuing his years-long charm offensive on traditionally right-leaning voters with plans for \"wealth creation\" and a National Wealth Fund. \"Economic growth and social justice must go hand in hand,\" Starmer said at the launch event of the manifesto. Labour has outlined five long-term missions if it comes to power: drive economic growth, invest in green energy, overhaul the NHS, create safer streets, and deliver \"opportunity\" through a new skills agenda. To aid these goals, Starmer is planning a radical shake-up of government ministries, Labour officials told the FT. Starmer, who voted for the Remain campaign not the depart the EU in the U.K.'s 2016 EU referendum, has also pledged to improve the \"botched\" U.K.-EU deal, including in areas such as trade, research and security. However, he has insisted there is no case for Britain to rejoin the bloc.\n\nPublic image problem?\n\nDespite his change agenda, Starmer is seen by many as an establishment figure, lacking the charisma of other politicians. A YouGov poll from earlier this year ranked him behind Reform's Nigel Farage in terms of public popularity \u2014 and his rating fell further among younger voters.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "In this article RACE-IT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIn the world of luxury, Herm\u00e8s is arguably the gold standard. Its sales are growing double digits even as other luxury companies post declines or dramatically slower growth. Wealthy customers lucky enough to be anointed as Birkin-bag worthy can purchase a Birkin 25 for about $11,000 and flip it the same day for more than $23,000. Analysts predict Herm\u00e8s could surpass Louis Vuitton in revenue within the next three years as the world's largest luxury brand. Herm\u00e8s stock is up 13% this year, while LVMH shares are flat and Kering is down 18%. There is one luxury company, however, that has raced past Herm\u00e8s when it comes to growth and brand cache \u2013 Ferrari. This year, Ferrari for the first time surpassed Herm\u00e8s as the most valuable luxury company in the world as measured by stock multiple, which gauges growth and profit prospects. Ferrari's stock now trades at 50 times earnings, compared with 48 for Herm\u00e8s and 23 for LVMH.\n\nThe storied automaker, founded in 1947 by Enzo Ferrari as way to fund his race team, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at $60 a share in 2015. It now trades at $410 a share. The company is valued at more than $75 billion \u2014 roughly 1\u00bd times the market cap of Ford or General Motors, which make millions of cars each year. Ferrari produced only 13,663 cars last year. Ferrari is not a traditional luxury company, of course. It makes cars and has a race team, a merchandise company, a car-restoration company and many businesses that bear little resemblance to a maker of $1,300 scarves and $800 sandals. Yet in a recent research report, Bernstein luxury analyst Luca Solca posits that Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s are similar, since both \"occupy the pinnacle of the pricing pyramid\" in their categories and are \"perfectly positioned\" to benefit from the surge in the global wealthy. To better understand what makes Ferrari a luxury brand, CNBC traveled to Ferrari headquarters in Maranello, Italy, to interview the company's CEO, Benedetto Vigna.\n\nGet Inside Wealth directly to your inbox The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today.\n\nVigna is an unlikely luxury king. He spent most of his career at Geneva-based semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics, where he ran its micro-electromechanical systems and sensors group. He helped create the screen sensor technology used in iPhones, for example. His appointment to the top job at Ferrari in 2021 was a sign that technology would be core to the supercar maker's growth, and in a sense, the future of luxury. In an interview at the company's $200 million E-Building, Vigna talked about the upcoming electric Ferrari, its commitment to sustainability and current global demand for Ferraris. The main topic of conversation, however, was on what makes Ferrari a leader in luxury, and what lessons other companies and executives serving wealthy clients could heed from its rise. Here are five main takeaways:\n\n1. Play hard to get\n\nFerrari Purasangue SUV Adam Jeffery | CNBC\n\nAs Solca points out in his research note, Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s both \"sell less than the market would take.\" A lot less. Based on orders, analysts estimate Ferrari could easily sell two or three times its current production. Ferrari's allure was built on scarcity and exclusivity. Even if you can afford a Ferrari, with an average price of $380,000, securing an order is nearly impossible. The wait time for a Purosangue, Ferrari's pseudo-SUV, and other hot models is now up to three years, the longest in its history. Ask any Ferrari dealer about their biggest problem, and they'll say: \"Not enough cars, too many frustrated clients.\" But CEO Vigna said the scarcity is part of Ferrari's brand promise. \"We have to stay true to our founders strategy, which is to always sell one car less than the market demands.\" His strategy is to grow profit by making more on each car, rather than making more cars. \"We always want to push the quality of revenues over quantity,\" he said. Indeed, Ferrari's production increases over the years have lagged far behind the growth of wealthy potential buyers. In 2010, it produced 6,573 cars, which means over the past 14 years, production has doubled. Over the same period, the global population of billionaires has more than tripled (and so has the population of those worth $30 million+ and $100 million+). Vigna said seeing a Ferrari on the road should be like seeing a rare and exotic animal. The imbalance also gives Ferrari a unique position in the auto world: The cars usually appreciate in value over time. Vigna said that if clients have to wait for one, all the better. \"Waiting is part of the experience,\" he said. During CNBC's visit to the factory, a Ferrari customer took delivery of a new maroon 812 Superfast. He looked to be in his 70s or 80s. When he saw the car, and posed with it under the storied Ferrari entrance gates, his face lit up and he transformed into a 10-year-old on Christmas morning. Ferraris are special, because they are still special.\n\n2. Make emotion the driver\n\nThe Ferrari SP38 seen at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2022 on June 23rd in Chichester, England. Martyn Lucy | Getty Images\n\nAsk any Ferrari fan or owner what makes a Ferrari a Ferrari, and they might say the design, the engine sound, the handling, the power, the braking, or the 100 years of racing history behind that bright yellow badge. Vigna says a true luxury product is defined by one chief characteristic: emotion. \"Ferrari is a luxury company because it's a company that is delivering a unique product. It's connecting with the most inner part of people, the emotional side,\" he said. \"A luxury company is a company that is using technology, innovation, storytelling, heritage, everything, with the ultimate goal to feed that emotional side that we all have.\" Vigna said Ferrari will never produce vehicles that people simply need for transportation. \"When I get invitations to talk to conferences, I won't attend if I hear two words \u2014 utility or mobility. We don't make a useful product. We make an emotional product,\" he told CNBC. It's similar to what LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault refers to as \"desirability.\" It's not enough to make a high-quality product, or an expensive product or one with more features or functions. It has to tug at the heart.\n\n3. The art of pricing\n\nAn in-progress Ferrari at the supercar maker's E-Building in Maranello, Italy. Crystal Lau | CNBC\n\nBased on Ferrari's soaring prices, you'd think pricing is based on profit demands and Wall Street's obsession with margin growth. Yet Vigna said the base price for each model is actually set about a month before its launch \u2013 in an unusual process. \"The way we define price in our company is very simple,\" he said. \"One month before the car is ready for the unveil, we go on the track \u2014 me and several people \u2014 and we drive it for a day or a day and a half. And then with fresh emotion in our body, we define the price. It's me, the CMO and the CFO defining the price. We share the emotion.\" Clearly, those emotions are rising. The cheapest Ferrari in 2012 was the California, with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $195,000. Today's entry-level Ferrari, the Roma, starts at $273,000, or 40% more. Ferrari is launching more limited-edition and special-edition cars that command far higher prices: The SF90 XX Stradale starts at around $900,000, and all 799 coupes and open-top Spiders were sold out when it was unveiled. The SP3 Daytona, with only 599 units, starts at $2.3 million. Perhaps the biggest boost to profits is personalization. Today's Ferrari buyers increasingly want custom paint colors, leather, fabrics, stitching, exposed carbon-fiber and other personal details that make it their own. Those personal touches can add anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 to the sale price. Vigna said his \"value over volume\" strategy means Ferrari can grow profits in the double digits with only modest increases in cars made.\n\n4. The road to VIP status\n\nFerrari would never admit it, but dealers will tell you that customers have to work their way up a costly commercial ladder to get access to new Ferraris and especially limited editions. It's similar to the path Rolex buyers have to follow to eventually get a new Daytona, or Herm\u00e8s customers have to take to eventually get a Birkin. In short, you start by buying a basic (and sometimes less popular) model. Then you can buy a slightly more desirable model, or two or three. If you attend Ferrari events, show support for the brand, even join a Ferrari racing program, you can eventually become eligible for more expensive and even limited-edition models. Nearly three-quarters of all Ferraris are sold to existing customers. Which means starting at the bottom of the ladder is difficult. \"Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s reserve their most desirable products for their most loyal customers,\" Solca said. \"This in effect 'bundles' access and amps up desirability.\"\n\n5. Happy employees means happier customers\n\nWorkers at the new Ferrari NV E-building factory in Maranello, Italy, on Friday, June 21, 2024.

        "body": "In this article MSFT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nWith Microsoft's new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard, you can type and use the trackpad without the accessory being physically connected to the 11th edition of the Surface Pro. Jordan Novet | CNBC\n\nWhen Microsoft announced its new line of Windows PCs in May, the company said the computers were \"designed for AI\" with new chips from Qualcomm that are more energy efficient than previous Intel processors. Among the first of the devices \u2014 called Copilot+ PCs \u2014 to hit the market is a Surface Pro convertible tablet. It can handle heftier computing tasks and boasts a longer battery life than laptops with Intel processors. It's a similar strategy to what Apple embarked on in 2020 when it started shipping custom energy-sipping Arm-based chips into its MacBooks, a move that has proved hugely successful. But what Microsoft has ultimately released with the Surface Pro amounts to a nice upgrade over its predecessor. To think it's ushering in a new era of AI computing is a bit farfetched. At least for now. The Surface line of computers doesn't drive a big business for Microsoft. The company reported $1.07 billion in device revenue, including from Surface PCs, in the first quarter, a small slice of its total $61.86 billion in revenue. I've been reviewing the Surface Pro for two weeks. Here's what you need to know about it.\n\nWhat's good\n\nThe Surface Pro hardware is high end. Microsoft sent me a review unit with Qualcomm's 12-core Snapdragon X Elite chip, a 512GB solid-state drive, 16GB of RAM and an OLED display. The device starts at $999, but this model costs $1,499.99. Performance is snappy for web browsing \u2014 Google shipped an Arm version of Chrome for Windows in March \u2014 and productivity software and a few video games, including \"Retrowave World\" and \"Poly Bridge 3,\" ran fine. The display is detailed and bright, with smooth scrolling thanks to a 120Hz refresh rate. The touchscreen is responsive. The iconic kickstand propping up the display is still solid. Under the kickstand, you'll find a compartment protecting the SSD, making hard drive replacements or upgrades easy. The Surface Pro delivered over eight hours of battery life in my early testing. Microsoft promises up to 10 hours of web browsing. The Surface Pro 9 with Microsoft's Arm-based SQ3 chip, released in 2022, was billed as having up to 19 hours of battery life, but reviewers found that app compatibility remained problematic. And unlike previous Arm-powered Surface PCs, such as the Surface Pro X from 2019, this model can run a wide assortment of applications, meaning buyers won't have to make a big compromise on compatibility. That's because Microsoft introduced a new emulator called Prism to help these new computers run programs designed for Intel and AMD chips.\n\nThe Surface Pro retains its familiar kickstand design. Jordan Novet | CNBC\n\nAlmost daily, developers show off smart software relying on AI models for a range of purposes. Most of the time, the programs use servers in data centers to run difficult processing chores. But increasingly, developers are delegating some processing to users' phones and computers. A Copilot+ PC should be well suited for this emerging type of software, thanks to a neural processing unit, or NPU. The architecture leads to longer battery life because the rest of the chip can do other work. Microsoft includes some of its own artificial intelligence features in Windows 11 that draw on the NPU. If you join video calls, you can open the Settings app on the Surface Pro Copilot+ PC and turn on an option called Eye Contact. It will make you appear to be looking right at your webcam during calls, even when you're reading text. Apple has a similar simulated eye contact feature for FaceTime calls on the iPad. In Paint, you can enable a Cocreator mode to produce an image inspired by whatever you draw on the screen and using a description you type in. The computer's NPU spits out the image, but only after Microsoft sends your text prompt to the cloud to make sure you're not trying to craft something harmful or offensive. I found it fun to see how Cocreator would interpret my suggestions, but the results were not very impressive. I was better off pressing the Copilot key on the keyboard, which brings up a window for chatting with Microsoft's Copilot, and asking it to create images in a text chat. But you only have so many free image-generation credits with Copilot before it starts handling requests more slowly, whereas the Paint feature is consistently speedy. An AC adapter in the box magnetically latches on to Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect port. It will be familiar to those who have bought Surface devices in the past decade. But you can also charge with one of the two USB-C ports, which is convenient. The Surface Pro can be hooked up to three monitors at 4K resolution, while the MacBook Air with an M3 chip can drive a single external display with up to 6K resolution at a 60Hz refresh rate. There's no headphone jack on the $999 tablet. Nor does it come with a keyboard, following tradition. After all, an iPad still doesn't come with a keyboard. A standard Surface Pro Keyboard that magnetically snaps onto the bottom of the Surface Pro sells for $139.99, and if you'd also like a model with Microsoft's Slim Pen stylus, you'll pay $279.99. Microsoft sent me its new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard with a Slim Pen included, a bundle that costs $449.98. It's more expensive than the regular attachable keyboard because it connects over Bluetooth. Microsoft promises 41 hours of continuous typing with the accessory. It charges while attached to the Surface Pro. For some users, it might be helpful to pull off the keyboard and use it while keeping the tablet a short distance away. I didn't find the accessory to be a big upgrade from the good old Surface Pro Keyboard.\n\nThe Copilot key to the left of the arrow keys brings up a window for chatting with Microsoft's multipurpose virtual assistant. Jordan Novet | CNBC\n\nWhat's bad\n\nThe biggest AI feature coming to this new Surface Pro and other Copilot+ PCs isn't available yet. When Microsoft announced Copilot+ PCs in May, executives spent ample time talking about Recall, which will let you type in a few words to search through your PC activity and see matching results. The company delayed the launch and said Recall would be off by default after security researchers found that hackers might be able to get to users' private data through screenshots the feature captures. Meanwhile, some applications, including Google Drive and ExpressVPN, still won't work on these new computers, at least for the moment. And as Windows on Arm gains early traction, there can be times when a traditional version of an app will be available in Microsoft's app store, but a native Arm version can be found on the developer's website. (That's the case with the media player VLC, for example.) But as a rule, software is less of an issue now for Surface PCs sporting long battery life. And Microsoft has reduced the powers of the Copilot to control your PC on this device, making it similar to just visiting the chatbot on the web. When the company brought Copilot to Windows 11 last fall, the assistant could open programs, switch to dark mode and disable Bluetooth.\n\nIt's easy to replace the solid-state drive on the new Surface Pro. Jordan Novet | CNBC\n\nShould you buy it?\n\nThe 11th edition of the Surface Pro is worth considering, so long as you can be assured that the apps that you need will work on an Arm-based machine. That's more likely to be true than it was five years ago. The battery life is good, I like that it's easy to upgrade and swap out storage and the screen is excellent. It's a solid upgrade over earlier models. Microsoft made the right decision to move to Arm-based processors. But, the company has been billing this as an \"AI PC,\" but, for now, the biggest AI features aren't here yet.",

When you have a food scare you don't want anyone getting sick on a plane,\" said Harteveldt. \"Going to all pasta is the safest and smartest option.\"\n\nThe airline industry is facing another challenge: a possible strike by workers at major inflight caterer Gate Gourmet.

        "title": "Constellation delivers beer profits, but weakness in wine prompts a downgrade",
        "body": "Constellation Brands reported an earnings beat on Wednesday that was driven by strength in its beer business. However, shares fell 4% after an initial move up, as investors \u2014 including us \u2014 remain troubled by continued weakness in the wines and spirits business. Comparable net sales for the three months ended May 31 increased 6% year over year to $2.662 billion, missing Wall Street's expectations of $2.671 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) increased 17% compared with the same period last year, to $3.57, a beat versus the $3.46 per share predicted by analysts. Constellation Brands Why we own it : We like Constellation Brands for its beer franchise, which includes popular Mexican brands Modelo, Corona and Pacifico. We would like Constellation to concentrate on beer and divest its wine and spirits business. Competitors : Anheuser-Busch Inbev and Molson Coors Weight in Club portfolio : 2.5% Most recent buy : April 16, 2024 Initiated: May 5, 2022 Bottom line This quarter reaffirmed our belief that Constellation has a great beer business that is weighed down by its wine-and-spirits unit. While overall sales came up short, CEO Bill Newlands said it still beat the overall consumer packaged goods growth by 4.5 percentage points. That outperformance was largely driven by the growth of its beer business, which attained the second largest share gain in the entire beverage industry and the top share gain in alcoholic beverages. We were again pleased to see that the increase in beer sales was driven by strong growth in shipment volume. Remember, the ability to grow sales via increased volume is crucial given the inflationary dynamics we've had to deal with coming out of Covid. That's because consumers are starting to push back on high prices. The ability to grow sales via increased volumes alleviates some pressure on management to take action on prices, a key factor that should help the company continue gaining market share. Operating cash flow came in light, but free cash flow was largely in line with expectations. As members know, cash flow is the key to shareholder returns and indeed, management paid out $185 million in dividends during the quarter, while repurchasing $200 million worth of shares and repurchased another $40 million worth of shares in June. The team continues to target a net leverage ratio of 3 times by the end of the fiscal year. Management said it is working to right the wine-and-spirits business and expects to see improvements in the back half of the year as \"operational and commercial execution initiatives\" identified in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year and started in the first quarter of this year take hold. Guidance is in line with the expectation that weakness in the business is bottoming out. We maintain the view that a rebound or divestiture of the wine-and-spirits segment remains key to the stock reaching new highs. While we are sticking with the name given the strength in beer, we opted to trim our position and downgrade the stock to a 2 rating. We want to see actual progress before getting more positive on the trajectory of the stock from here. We are keeping our price target of $300. Quarterly results Constellation's wine-and-spirits division remains a drag, with net sales falling 7% to $389 million, slightly below Street estimates, while operating income dropped 25% to around $60 million. Operating margin for the segment was down 370 basis points to 15.3%, worse than expectations. The weakness is attributable to lower volumes and higher costs of goods sold, which more than offset the benefits of lower operating expenses elsewhere. Shipment volumes declined 5.1% due to \"challenging\" market conditions, primarily in the U.S. wholesale channel. Depletions, a key metric that represents how much was product was sold to retailers by a distributor, were down 12.7% from a year ago. \"The tactical investments in the 11 brands that represent 75% of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our wine and spirits business in fiscal '24 are now underway, and we expect to see improvements in this select group of our most scaled offerings over the remainder of the year,\" the company said during its post-earnings call with investors. Beer segment results, on the other hand, remain largely positive. Though sales did come in a bit light versus estimates, the result still amounts to 8% year-over-year growth. Moreover, strong profitability led to a beat on operating income despite the topline miss. Operating margin expansion resulted from greater operating leverage (fixed costs were more spread out), along with benefits from ongoing cost-saving initiatives, and timing and efficiencies in marketing investments. Shipments increased 7.6% year over year. Depletions were up 6.4% versus the year-ago period, led by growth in Modelo Especial (11%), Pacifico (21%), and Modelo Chelada (over 5%). Citing Circana channel data, the company said its beer business was the top dollar sales share gainer for the 11 th consecutive quarter and the top volume share gainer in the total beer category in the U.S. Moreover, Constellations beer portfolio has 4 of the top 15 dollar share-gaining brands in the quarter. Guidance Management reaffirmed the guidance it gave in the previous quarter. Net sales are expected to increase 6% to 7%, driven by 7% to 9% growth in beer. Sales of wine and spirits are pegged at down 0.5% to up 0.5%. Enterprise operating income is expected to increase 10% to 12% on a comparable basis, with beer up 10% to 12% and wine and spirits down 9% to 11%. Management expects comparable earnings to be $13.50 to $13.80 per share. Operating cash flow is forecasted to land between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, with free cash flow of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, after accounting for $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion on capital expenditures, with $1.2 billion of that targeted to support capacity additions to its Mexican beer operations.

        "body": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year. STR | Nurphoto via Getty Images\n\nBitcoin's price slumped to around $57,000 apiece Thursday, hitting a two-month low after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes from its June meeting indicating the central bank isn't yet ready to cut interest rates. At around 2:30 p.m. London time, the digital currency fell around 5% in 24 hours to $56,837, falling below the $57,000 mark for the first time since May 1, according to data from crypto ranking site CoinGecko. Since then, bitcoin has pared losses somewhat and was trading at $57,932.57, down 3.4% as of 5:05 p.m. London time. Rival token ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, was down 5% at $3,120.\n\nIt comes after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday released minutes from its June meeting which showed officials are reluctant to lower interest rates until additional data shows inflation moving sustainably toward the central bank's 2% target. Higher interest rates are typically less favorable for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it dampens investor risk appetite. Bitcoin stormed to an all-time high of above $73,700 in March this year after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF.\n\nETFs allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Crypto proponents say this has helped legitimize the asset class and make it easier for larger institutional investors to get involved. Since then, however, bitcoin has been trading within a range between roughly $59,000 and $72,000. Recently, the world's largest cryptocurrency has been pressured by news of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox readying the distribution of around $9 billion worth of coins to users, which is expected to lead to some significant selling action.\n\nwatch now\n\nOn Thursday, a small amount of bitcoin was moved from three wallets previously associated with Mt. Gox, according to Arkham Intelligence. The largest movement was for $24 worth of the cryptocurrency. It was not immediately clear if this transaction was made in connection with the Mt. Gox repayment plan. Elsewhere, the German government on Thursday sold roughly 3,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth approximately $175 million as of today's prices \u2014 from a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movie2k, according to blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence . Arkham, which is tracking the German government's bitcoin wallet, said that the assets were moved to crypto exchanges Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase, as well as an separate, unidentified wallet. \"These funds are likely moving to a deposit for an institutional service or OTC,\" Arkham said in a post on X.\n\nCan bitcoin still gain from here?\n\nHowever, analysts at crypto data and research firm CCData said in a research report Tuesday that bitcoin hasn't yet reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to hit a fresh all-time high. According to the report, historical market \"cycles\" have shown that bitcoin's so-called \"halving\" event \u2014 which cuts the supply of new bitcoins to the market \u2014 has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last between 12 to 18 months \u201cbefore producing a cycle top.\u201d\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Getty Images\n\nThe European Union on Thursday confirmed its decision to hike tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China \u2014 with one automaker issuing fresh warnings that it may have to raise prices as a result. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, announced plans for such levies in June after concluding in an investigation that producers of battery EVs in China benefit from \"unfair\" subsidization. On Thursday, European regulators confirmed that these duties, which have been lightly tweaked to range from 17.4% to 37.6%, will come into effect on Friday. The levies will affect automakers from Chinese giant BYD to, potentially, European brands that make cars in China, and even U.S. giant Tesla , which has a factory in Shanghai.\n\nThe EU's decision comes at a time when Chinese automakers have been aggressively expanding into Europe with competitively priced offerings, posing a threat to the region's top automakers, many of which have lagged behind in EVs. The European Commission says these carmakers have benefitted from \"unfair subsidisation.\" Automakers have already hit back at the tariffs. On Thursday, Chinese EV maker Nio said it is currently maintaining prices for its cars sold into Europe, but added that it \"cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed.\" A spokesperson for another Chinese EV upstart, Xpeng said on Thursday that customers who are awaiting deliveries of cars, or those who place new orders before the tariffs take effect, will be \"protected from any price increases.\" It did not comment on whether it would end up raising prices as a result of the levies. Geely declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. When the EU first announced the tariffs last month, Tesla said it will likely increase the Europe prices of its Model 3 vehicle. The EU has yet to say what specific level of tariffs Tesla will face, but noted last month that the U.S. automaker \"may receive an individually calculated duty rate.\"\n\nChina-EU negotiations\n\nThe tariffs that take effect Friday are provisional and last for four months. In that time, EU member states must vote on so-called \"definitive duties,\" which would last five years.\n\nwatch now\n\nChinese and EU officials have held several rounds of meetings to discuss the tariffs, with Beijing in June criticizing the EU's imposition of tariffs as a \"protectionist act.\" Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong said on Thursday that he hopes the two sides will \"meet each other halfway, show sincerity, speed up the consultation process, and, on the basis of rules and reality, reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible.\"\n\nChinese EV maker committed to Europe",

        "body": "In this article 9984.T-JP\n\nARM Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nMasayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, speaks during the company's annual general meeting in Tokyo on June 20, 2024. Kosuke Okahara | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nSoftBank Group shares hit a record high on Thursday, just as the company's massive tech investment arm shows signs of recovery and its outspoken founder Masayoshi Son emerged back into the public spotlight to align the Japanese giant to a future in artificial intelligence. The firm has also been helped by the public market success of British chip designer Arm , in which Softbank has a majority stake. Shares of the Japanese giant closed at a record high of 11,190.00 Japanese yen on Thursday \u2014 a far cry from the dotcom crash of the early 2000s and a more recent downturn for the company during the tech market troubles of 2021 and 2022.\n\nSoftBank's journey to the peak\n\nSon founded SoftBank in 1981, back when the company distributed software. It went public in Japan in 1994, and, amid the internet boom, made a $2 million investment in Yahoo in the middle of that decade.\n\nThat started off the company's tech investments. The rise of the internet and of Yahoo pushed SoftBank's stock to a peak closing price of 10,111.1 yen on Feb. 18, 2000. Three days prior, the firm's shares had hit an intraday high of 11,000 yen. As internet stocks came crashing down, so too did SoftBank's share price, which at one point sank more than 90% below its dotcom peak. It wasn't until nearly 21 years later, on Feb. 16, 2021, that SoftBank exceeded its previous record-high close.\n\nVision Fund\n\nThe recent rise to a share price peak has been volatile since Son positioned SoftBank as a visionary pioneer with the 2017 launch of a massive technology investment arm \u2014 the Vision Fund. SoftBank made dozens of bets on tech companies across the world, some of which turned sour. Office sharing startup WeWork was perhaps among the highest-profile names. But some of SoftBank's investments in Chinese firms also took a hit after Beijing kicked off its crackdown on the domestic tech sector at the end of 2020. After lingering near then-record highs in March 2021, SoftBank's stock fell sharply, alongside other global tech stocks. The Vision Fund posted then-record financial losses in 2022. Son said that SoftBank would go into \"defense\" mode and be more conservative with its investments. He changed tack shortly after the Vision Fund posted a record $32 billion loss in 2023, saying that the company would now shift into \"offense,\" because he was excited about the investment opportunities in AI.\n\nwatch now\n\nSoftBank's share price began a recovery from around May 2023, and the Japanese titan's Vision Fund more recently posted better financials amid broader tech stock recoveries. \"Softbank Vision Fund had to write down various investments due to a combination of equity values declining and a tougher private financing environment. It looks like the write down cycle is mostly done, and there is a good chance that the IPO market will be more constructive going forward, especially for AI related investments,\" Oliver Matthew, head of Asian consumer research at CLSA, told CNBC by email.\n\nArm chip boost\n\nSeveral analysts attributed SoftBank's recent share price bump of around 78% in the year to date to the IPO success of Arm, which it acquired in 2016. SoftBank owns roughly 90% of Arm even after the listing. Arm shares are up nearly 124% alone this year, as of the close on July 3. \"SoftBank Group's investment strategy and focus has long included the development of an AI ecosystem portfolio, long before the LLM (large language model)-driven bull cycle in AI-related names over the last 18 months or so,\" Paul Golding, senior U.S. lifestyle and payments analyst at Macquarie U.S. equity research, told CNBC by email. \"This vision, in our view, likely drove some of the investment decision in 2016 to acquire Arm, giving SoftBank Group direct exposure to semiconductor market dynamics and ownership of intellectual property around semiconductor design well ahead of broader progress in AI use-cases and platforms.\" SoftBank shares \"have been benefitting from this vis-\u00e0-vis well-publicized\" uses for Arm intellectual property, such as in the automotive industry or cloud data center, Golding added.\n\nwatch now\n\nDo investors believe the SoftBank story?\n\nOver the years, investors have focused on whether SoftBank Group's valuation fairly reflects the assets it is invested in or holds. For example, SoftBank's valuation is around $101.5 billion. Arm's market capitalization is around $176 billion \u2014 meaning that SoftBank's 90% stake is equivalent to about $158 billion of that figure. That alone is significantly above SoftBank Group's overall valuation, without taking into account the company's other holdings and businesses, such as its telecommunications arm. Analysts cite this as a reason why SoftBank's share price does not reflect its fair value. Dan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said a lot of SoftBank's price appreciation comes down to Arm. \"I'm not sure that investors are convinced by the SoftBank story again,\" Baker told CNBC by email, adding that this year's share gain is \"primarily\" because Arm stock has risen, while the Japanese yen has weakened. Baker said it is worth looking at the so-called sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which ascribes value to the various parts of SoftBank's holdings to figure what the company is worth. Baker said the SOTP valuation remains just under 50% this year, meaning SoftBank's stock does not truly reflect the value of its various businesses and investments. \"So I'm not sure that investors are 'buying the SoftBank story' but investors are certainly buying the ARM story,\" Baker said. Investors have also cheered the fact that SoftBank has sold practically all of its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that Son backed in 2000. SoftBank has also likely been helped by a recent broader rise in Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei 225 Index up 22% this year alone as of Thursday.\n\nArtificial super intelligence\n\nBut can Son's focus on AI boost SoftBank's value further and close the discount to its basket of assets? The SoftBank founder, who has been out of the public spotlight in the last year, recently spoke about his excitement over the future of AI and how SoftBank can be at the center of this technology with its investment in companies like Arm. Son last month laid out his vision for a world featuring what he dubbed as artificial super intelligence, or ASI, which would be 10,000 times smarter than humans. It comes at a time when investors are feverishly looking at how to play the AI boom, with the parabolic rise of Nvidia's stock price underscoring the excitement around the technology.\n\nwatch now",

Shares in the Danish pharmaceutical company's shares were little changed on Thursday, dipping in early morning trade before rising 0.1% as of 11:17 a.m. London time.\n\nThe Harvard report found that patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity, who are prescribed semaglutide, have an increased risk of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) \u2014 a condition which can lead to loss of vision in one eye. Patients were more likely to be diagnosed with the eye condition compared to patients who were not prescribed the weight loss drugs, the study found.\n\nWhile the research paper does suggest \"some correlation\" with a rare ocular event, the quality of the evidence is \"vey low, the error bars are very wide,\" according to Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis.\n\nThe worst case scenario would likely be a further update to the label warning section of the drugs, which is \"hardly a game-changer,\" said Papadakis.\n\nHe added that Deutsche Bank generally regards semaglutide medications as \"one of the most derisked therapeutic classes in industry history from a safety perspective.\"\n\nA spokesperson from Novo Nordisk said the optic nerve disease NAION is not an \"adverse drug reaction for the marketed formulations of semaglutide\" as per the approved labels. They added that there are \"key methodological limitations\" to the study such as the \"small number of people\" with type 2 diabetes or obesity that were exposed to semaglutide and were included in the trial.\n\n\"Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,\" the spokesperson said.",

        "body": "U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives the commencement address at the commencement ceremony for graduates of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S., May 30, 2024.\n\nHarris would likely have the keys to most of the money, according to Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who acknowledged the rules during a recent call with party donors. Biden's campaign began June with $91 million in cash on hand, according to Federal Election Commission records. The entire political operation, which includes Biden's joint fundraising committees, entered July with $240 million on hand, according to the campaign.\n\nHarris has emerged as an early favorite to replace the president at the top of the ticket, but this does not guarantee that the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will not feature more contenders and a potentially messy battle for the nomination.\n\nKey issues include whether Harris would control the massive Biden-Harris campaign war chest managed by Biden's team if the president were to drop out of the race.\n\nThese conversations have been held over phone calls and text messages between some people who raised money for the vice president during her failed 2020 Democratic primary campaign against Biden and other contenders, said the people, who were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about private conversations.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris ' allies are privately discussing what her candidacy would look like if President Joe Biden dropped out of the race for the White House and how they could help her, following Biden's disastrous debate performance Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThere's also discussion among Harris confidants about the need to begin scheduling meetings for the vice president with some of the biggest donors in the Democratic Party if Biden drops out, these people said.\n\nHarris' allies have been pushing other donors and party officials to reconsider the potential advantages the vice president's policy portfolio could bring to a Democratic campaign platform: Her focus on reproductive rights, her outreach to Black voters and marginalized communities and her remarks in February in Germany, when she emphasized the strength of U.S. support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion, according to a person familiar with the engagement.\n\nSome of Harris' past fundraisers are also texting one another an old one-minute video that features the vice president taking on former President Donald Trump's appointees while she was a U.S. senator, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. It shows clips of Harris facing off with the likes of former Attorneys General Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions and then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe video also underscores a key message, they say: Harris' willingness to confront Trump's allies shows that she has what it takes to go face to face against the former president. \"Taking on Trump one on one, Kamala will use her backbone, her values, and her experience as a prosecutor to expose Trump,\" a voiceover for the advertisement says.\n\nThe video was produced for a political action committee called \"People Standing Strong,\" which was never fully activated because Harris dropped out in 2019 shortly after it was created. The PAC reportedly reserved nearly $300,000 worth of advertising across the key state of Iowa but the ads were not aired because Harris dropped out before the state's caucus.\n\nA White House spokeswoman for Harris and Biden campaign representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAny discussions of what Harris might need to win a convention fight for the nomination was unthinkable for Democrats before Thursday's debate, when Biden struggled to make the case for his reelection and failed to push back on Trump.\n\nBiden's poor debate performance greatly changed the mood among donors, with many privately discussing the need for the president to step aside in order to give the party the best chance of beating Trump in November.\n\nThe donors sending around the video, for instance, are \"all just confused, scared and sad\" since the debate, said a longtime strategist close to many of the top fundraisers in California. \"They're desperate to beat Trump.\"\n\nDmitri Mehlhorn, a longtime advisor to Democratic donors including tech investor Reid Hoffman, said in an email Wednesday to allies that was shared with CNBC that although he continues to support Biden, in his view Harris would be a solid alternative to take on and potentially defeat Trump.\n\n\"To be clear, Vice President Harris is a badass. A ticket with her at the top, combined with someone who balances her brand weaknesses (examples range from Mark Kelly to Andy Beshear to Roy Cooper to Josh Shapiro and many others), would absolutely be competitive with the criminally insane convicted felon the other side is committed to nominating,\" wrote Mehlhorn. \"We would lose Joe's superpower brand, but we would gain other benefits and would still be competitive.\"\n\nBiden's team has said the president is not dropping out of the race. Meanwhile, Harris, to all appearances, has remained loyal and is scheduled to have lunch with the president at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nDespite his team's public pledge that he won't drop out, The New York Times and CNN reported Wednesday that Biden has signaled privately to an ally he may not be able to salvage his candidacy.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates vehemently denied the story in a social media post. CNBC and NBC News have not independently confirmed the conversation.\n\nHarris defended the president's debate performance to a group of her past donors in San Francisco on Tuesday.\n\nThe event was at real estate executive Susan Lowenberg's home, and the crowd included Harris donors from the time when she was running for San Francisco District Attorney, according to the pool report.\n\n\"We gotta fight, and we know how to fight,\" Harris said to the crowd. \"When we fight, we win.\"\n\nSince the debate, there's been a growing chorus of party donors, most of whom have spoken in private, and a few lawmakers who have spoken in public who question whether Biden is up to the task of being president for four more years, and if he is not, whether it's right for him to be the party's nominee in November.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, on Tuesday became the first Democratic lawmaker in Congress to call on Biden to step down.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., both longtime Biden allies, said in interviews on MSNBC that it's fair for voters to ask about Biden's health in the wake of his debate performance.\n\n\"I think it's a legitimate question to say, 'Is this an episode or is this a condition?'\" Pelosi said in the interview, noting that the question should be asked of both Biden and Trump.\n\nThe polls have had a mixed message for Biden since the debate.\n\nA CNN poll shows that Trump is ahead of Biden by 6 percentage points nationwide, which is identical to the network's national poll in April.\n\nBut 75% of those polled say that someone else other than Biden would have a better chance of beating Trump than Biden would.\n\nHarris' stock has also started to rise in online betting pools about who will be the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nPredictIt, which allows people to make bets on political events, now puts the vice president in a close second to Biden.\n\nBefore the debate, PredictIt put her odds of becoming the party's nominee this year so far behind Biden that she was trailing the likes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",

        "body": "Federal Reserve officials at their June meeting indicated that inflation is moving in the right direction but not quickly enough for them to lower interest rates, minutes released Wednesday showed.\n\n\"Participants affirmed that additional favorable data were required to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent,\" the meeting summary said.\n\nThough the minutes reflected disagreement from the 19 central bankers who took part in the discussion, with some even indicating a penchant toward raising rates if necessary, the meeting concluded with Federal Open Market Committee voters holding rates in place.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% annual inflation, a level it has been above since early in 2021. Officials at the meeting said data has improved lately, though they are want more evidence that it will continue.\n\nMeeting participants \"emphasized that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate until additional information had emerged to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee's 2 percent objective.\"\n\nAt the meeting, policymakers also provided an update on economic projections and monetary policy over the next several years.\n\nThe FOMC \"dot plot\" showed one quarter percentage point cut by the end of 2024, down from the three indicated following the last update in March. Even though the dot plot indicated one cut this year, futures markets continue to price in two, starting in September.\n\nAlso, the committee largely left its economic projections intact, though they lowered their inflation expectations for this year.\n\nIn discussions over how they would approach monetary policy, the minutes reflected some disagreements. Some members noted the need to tighten the reins should inflation persist, while others made the case that they should be ready to respond should the economy falter or the labor market weaken.\n\n\"Several participants observed that, were inflation to persist at an elevated level or to increase further, the target range for the federal funds rate might need to be raised,\" the minutes stated. \"A number of participants remarked that monetary policy should stand ready to respond to unexpected economic weakness.\"\n\nThe minutes do not identify individual members nor do they provide exact amounts for the number of officials expressing particular viewpoints. However, in the Fed parlance, \"a number\" is considered more than \"several.\"\n\nThe summary also noted a \"vast majority\" saw economic growth \"gradually cooling\" and that the current policy is \"restrictive,\" a key term as the officials contemplate how restrictive policy needs to be while bringing down inflation and not causing undue economic harm.\n\nSince the meeting, officials have largely stuck to a cautious script stressing data dependency rather than forecasts. However, there have been indications from multiple officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, that continued encouraging readings on inflation would provide confidence that rates can be lowered.\n\nIn an appearance Tuesday in Portugal, Powell said the risks of cutting too soon and risking a resurgence in inflation against cutting too late and endangering economic growth have come more into balance. Previously, officials had stressed the importance of not backing off the inflation fight too soon.",
        "summary": "Federal Reserve officials at their June meeting indicated that inflation is moving in the right direction but not quickly enough for them to lower interest rates, minutes released Wednesday showed.\n\"Participants affirmed that additional favorable data were required to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent,\" the meeting summary said.\nThe Fed targets 2% annual inflation, a level it has been above since early in 2021.\nSince the meeting, officials have largely stuck to a cautious script stressing data dependency rather than forecasts.\nHowever, there have been indications from multiple officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, that continued encouraging readings on inflation would provide confidence that rates can be lowered.",

        "body": "Southwest Airlines said Wednesday that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, more commonly known as a \"poison pill,\" in response to activist Elliott Management's investment in the airline and push to oust CEO Bob Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe poison pill will only activate if Elliott \u2014 or another investor \u2014 acquires at least 12.5% of the company. If that threshold is crossed, all other shareholders will be entitled to purchase one new Southwest share for every share they currently own at a 50% discount.\n\nSouthwest shares added 1% on Wednesday after Southwest's announcement. Other major U.S. airlines also rose.\n\nElliott disclosed in June that it had amassed a $1.9 billion stake, or about 11% of Southwest. The firm called out Southwest's underperformance relative to some of its larger airline rivals that offer more products like premium seating.\n\nSouthwest said the poison pill was adopted in part because Elliott had made filings with antitrust authorities, known as HSR filings, that would allow the activist to acquire an even larger stake by next week. There is a 30-day waiting period after making an HSR filing, suggesting that Elliott began that process around the same time that it disclosed its stake in June.\n\n\"Southwest Airlines has made a good faith effort to engage constructively with Elliott Investment Management since its initial investment and remains open to any ideas for lasting value creation,\" Kelly said in a statement. Elliott and Southwest management met in person just two weeks ago, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSuch a provision would dilute Elliott's influence and power over voting. Companies often adopt shareholder rights plans in response to an activist threat; rental car company Hertz adopted a poison pill in 2013 in response to \"unusual\" trading activity that management thought presaged an activist.\n\nSouthwest's board backed the company's leadership after Elliott disclosed its stake. Jordan said last month he has no plans to resign.\n\nThe Dallas-based airline has struggled with issues including an oversupplied domestic market, where its network is focused, and lengthy delays of new planes from Boeing .\n\nSouthwest had been under pressure even before Elliott's investment to ramp up revenue and has said it is studying massive changes to its longstanding business model by potentially adding seating assignments and even premium seating. The airline had been wildly successful throughout much of its history, pulling in profits for most of its more than five decades of flying, an outlier in the boom-and-bust industry.\n\nElliott has mounted campaigns at other companies such as AT&T , Salesforce and Texas Instruments .\n\nElliott's activist practice has helped it become one of the most successful hedge funds in the world, surpassing $65 billion in assets. The firm, which moved its headquarters in 2020 from New York to West Palm Beach, Florida, has only had two losing years in five decades.\n\nBank of America and Morgan Stanley serve as Southwest's bankers. Vinson & Elkins and Kirkland & Ellis, two law firms with well-regarded activism defense practices, are Southwest's lawyers.\n\nElliott did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Zhang Peng | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nChina's population is shrinking, and the demographic shift will ultimately hurt its economy, shrink the labor force and put pressure on fiscal policy. \"The working age population [in China] will fall so rapidly over the next decade, that the Chinese economy will need to deal with 1% drag in GDP growth per year for next 10 years,\" Darren Tay, head of Asia country risk at BMI Country Risk & Industry Analysis, told \"Squawk Box Asia\" in June, referring to estimates gathered by evaluating world population data released by the United Nations. \"The fiscal strain as a result of ageing is immediate and concerning,\" the Economist Intelligence Unit has warned. \"Economic growth hinges on productivity, capital accumulation and labour inputs. The negative effect of an adverse demographic landscape will manifest primarily through a shrinking workforce,\" according to the report published in January. Raising the retirement age is \"one of the few viable options\" to maintain long-term fiscal balance, the EIU said. \"Our calculations suggest that if the retirement age is raised to 65 by 2035, the pension budget shortfall could be reduced by 20% and received net pension can be increased by 30%, suggesting relief of both government and household burden,\" according to the report. Birth rates are falling around the world as women choose to have children later, or not at all.\n\nwatch now\n\nFertility rates have halved across OECD countries \u2014 some of the world's richest nations \u2014 falling from about 3.3 children per woman in 1960 to about 1.5 children per woman in 2022, according to the OECD, or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \"This is significantly below the 'replacement level' of 2.1 children per woman needed to keep population constant in the absence of migration,\" according to the June report.\n\nChina's shrinking population\n\nChina's population is shrinking, and the demographic shift will ultimately hurt its economy, shrink the labor force and put pressure on fiscal policy. Laikwunfai | Istock | Getty Images\n\nFertility rate in the country is dropping more quickly than its regional peers like South Korea and Japan, Tianchen Xu, a senior economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), told CNBC. He said the three countries are disproportionately impacted by a rapidly aging population, largely due to improved standards of living, which have a \"very strong inverse relationship with fertility rates.\" China, in particular, has been \"growing at a very high rate for nearly three decades.\" and its economic expansion has been \"rapid and extended,\" he added. The country's welfare system has also \"lagged\" and fiscal support for childbearing is \"quite low by international comparison,\" according to Xu. Surging home prices are not helping. \"The government has largely been incapable of managing the significant rising housing costs,\" according to Xu, who pointed out that as housing becomes increasingly costly, people may find it difficult to purchase homes and delay starting a family.\n\nFalling birth rates\n\nThe rapid economic expansion seen in recent decades in developed nations has brought about rising income levels and the broadening of educational and career opportunities for women. These improved conditions have led to a greater opportunity cost for having children, Xu said. \"In more developed societies, the tendency is that parents face a much higher cost of raising children, and that tends to be a deterrent to having [them],\" said BMI's Tay. \"The more developed an economy is, the more skills the actors in the economy have to have, and thus, the required investment in each [child] rises by that amount,\" he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe work culture in Asia can also play a part. \"Among the Asian countries, there's the entrenched mindset of working long hours,\" said Xu, which is \"particularly an issue in China, South Korea... [and] other parts of East and Southeast Asia.\" \"These countries are where the aggregate working hours are the longest in the world,\" and as a result, workers have less time to build a family, Xu told CNBC.\n\nShrinking workforce\n\nA decline in fertility rate puts pressure on the economy and the society at large as the working population shrinks. \"A country's birth rates will translate into its working age population growth, some two decades down the road,\" said Tay from Maybank.. Additionally, falling fertility rates can impact the ratio of elderly folks who need support from younger generations, which can put \"excessive burdens on a country's health care and pension systems,\" Maybank's Tay told CNBC. Ultimately, the burden on younger generations will grow as they need to care not only for their own children, but for their elderly parents as well. This demographic shift in parts of Asia is a structural issue that will require \"determined and holistic government effort,\" on both fiscal and monetary policy, she said.\n\nChina's policy shifts\n\nIn China, policymakers have been putting a big emphasis on \"productivity growth,\" Xu told CNBC. \"They have [seen] that there's a very big decline in the labor contribution to GDP, [which] cannot be mitigated via any sort of policy intervention in the short term,\" he said. \"That's why they have been focusing on their productivity growth.\" The country has invested heavily into shifting to digital solutions and developing technologies such automation and advanced chips, said Xu, with the goal of making traditional industries more efficient, and overall, improving productivity. Looking ahead, Chinese policymakers are encouraged to do more about the labor environment. \"That probably entails tighter enforcement of the labor law and promoting work-life balance,\" said Xu.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the Middle East in the State Dining room at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 31, 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his White House staff spent Wednesday delivering pep talks in calls and meetings with close allies, Democratic governors, legislators and campaign staff.\n\n\"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running,\" Biden said on a call with campaign staff, an official told NBC News. \"I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win.\"\n\nThe comments are part of Biden's larger firefighting mission as his team works to quell Democratic panic about his reelection bid in the wake of his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump last week.\n\nBiden was joined at the Wednesday campaign meeting by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is increasingly drawing eyes as a potential replacement for the president if he chooses to drop out of the race.\n\nThe president spoke with some of his closest allies and Capitol Hill supporters Wednesday, including former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.\n\nThe president also has taped interviews with two Black radio shows, the Earl Ingram Show on the Civic Media Network and The Source with Andrea Lawful-Sanders on WURD Radio, scheduled to air Thursday morning, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at the Wednesday press briefing.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the president is also scheduled to meet with Democratic governors from across the U.S., many of whom have been floated as other potential stand-ins for Biden. That meeting follows a Monday huddle of governors, who reportedly expressed their concerns about the Democratic Party's path forward, according to NBC News.\n\nNew polls are delivering mixed signals about the president's current standing in the head-to-head rematch against Trump.\n\nA closely watched New York Times/Siena College poll released Wednesday found Trump leading Biden 49% to 41% among the registered voters surveyed. For likely voters, Trump led Biden by a slightly smaller 6-point margin, though that was 3 points higher than before the debate. The New York Times poll surveyed 1,532 registered voters across the country from June 28 to July 2. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.8 percentage points for registered voters. The debate was on June 27.\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll also out Wednesday echoed those findings, with Trump ahead of Biden 48% to 42%. That survey interviewed 1,500 registered voters from June 29 through July 2 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.\n\nA Tuesday CNN poll also found Trump with a 6-point lead against Biden, though that was the same as the poll's April result. The margin of error for that question was plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\nPolling so close after the debate represents a snapshot of immediate voter reactions and the results could change as voters take more time to process Biden's substandard performance.\n\nWhile Biden's campaign continues its blitz, pressure mounts for the president to consider bowing out of the 2024 race.\n\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday that Biden has privately told an ally that he is weighing whether to stay in the race. Several outlets including CNN and ABC News followed with similar reports. The White House has repeatedly said those reports are false.\n\nIn television interviews on Tuesday, Pelosi and Clyburn said it was reasonable to question Biden's physical and cognitive fitness, though they also doubled down in their support for the president.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, House Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, became the first congressional Democrat to officially call on Biden to bow out of the race. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Me., later published an op-ed expressing his lack of confidence in Biden's candidacy titled, \"Donald Trump is going to win the election and democracy will be just fine.\"\n\nIn response, the White House and the Biden campaign have rolled out a slate of events for the coming week to reassure the public.\n\nOn Friday, the president will sit for an interview with ABC News. He is also visiting key battleground states Wisconsin on Friday and Pennsylvania on Sunday. Additionally, the White House announced that next week Biden will give a press conference at the NATO summit.\n\n\"He has done more than 40 interviews this year alone, and we're going to continue that,\" Jean-Pierre said Tuesday. \"Those were unscripted. He's done more than 500 'gaggles.' Those are unscripted. And we want to continue to do that.\"",

        "title": "Hong Kong's IPO market is finally starting to turn around, consulting firm EY says",
        "body": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing celebrates the 24th anniversary of its listing on June 21, 2024. China News Service | China News Service | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 The market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years, starting in the second half of this year, George Chan, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday. \"I think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak [in 2021] but the trend is there,\" Chan said. \"I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\" High U.S. interest rates, regulatory scrutiny, slower economic growth and U.S.-China tensions have constrained Greater China IPOs in the last three years. EY said in a report that while the volume of IPOs and proceeds in the U.S. increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, mainland China and Hong Kong saw a sharp decline in listings. Many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around, which can support more IPOs in Hong Kong, said Chan, who is based in Shanghai. \"We are seeing a reversing trend,\" he told CNBC. \"We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong. The main reason is that Hong Kong has already factored in these uncertainties.\" The Hang Seng Index is up more than 5% year-to-date after four straight years of decline \u2014 which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index, according to Wind Information.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon\n\n\"Our HK cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for H2. We expect to see many HKSE listings,\" Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster in Hong Kong, said in an email Wednesday. Many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland China's A share market have decided to switch to one in Hong Kong, she said. \"Previously [China Securities Regulatory Commission] approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten CSRC approvals pretty quickly.\" In June, China issued new measures to promote venture capital, and authorities spoke publicly about supporting IPOs, especially in Hong Kong. Investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of IPO approvals for signs of a significant change. Chan said another supportive factor for Hong Kong IPOs is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland China, where economic growth is \"quite satisfactory.\" He expects consumer companies could be among the near-term IPO beneficiaries. \"As the economy slowly recovers, a lot of people in China are willing to spend,\" he said, noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country. Official national-level data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in China \u2014 up by just 3.7% in May from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10% or more in prior years. Also significant for global asset allocation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes. High rates have made Treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of IPOs. \"I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,\" Chan said. Hong Kong IPOs raised $1.5 billion during the first half of the year, a 34% drop from a year ago, EY said in a report released late last month. Back in 2021 and 2020, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saw nearly 100 or more IPOs a year raising tens of billions of dollars, according to the report. In comparison, mainland China IPOs raised $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 \u2014 a drop of 85% from the year-ago period, according to EY.\n\nwatch now\n\nBonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said during a conference last week that so far this year, the Hong Kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications \u2014 a 50% increase compared to the second half of last year. She is not related to EY's George Chan. \"The pipeline is building up nicely,\" she said, noting about 110 IPOs in total are in line for a Hong Kong listing. \"All we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely,\" she added.\n\nImproving post-IPO performance\n\n\"What we need is a strong pipeline,\" EY's Chan said. \"We need an interested investor with the money to invest, and we need a good aftermarket performance.\" Hong Kong IPO returns are improving. The average first-day return of new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24%, far more than the average of 1% in the same period last year, according to EY. \"The aftermarket performance of Hong Kong IPOs has been doing quite good compared to the past five years,\" Chan said. \"These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.\" Chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024.\n\nwatch now\n\nHe said those will likely be medium-sized \u2014 between 2 billion Hong Kong dollars to 5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($260 million to $640 million) \u2014 but added he expects better market momentum in 2025. Slowing economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty have also weighed on early-stage investment into Chinese startups. Total venture funding from foreign investors into Greater China deals plunged to $19 billion in 2023, down from $67 billion in 2021, according to Preqin, an alternative assets research firm. U.S. investors have not participated in the largest deals in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, the firm said in a report last month.\n\nU.S. IPO outlook",

        "body": "An insurance crisis that has sent premiums skyrocketing and caused carriers to flee coastal states like Florida and California is spreading, and it is fundamentally changing the real estate market in states across the country.\n\n\"Not only is the cost higher than people anticipated, but just the inability to secure insurance at all makes deals fall through before they even happen,\" said Bill Baldwin, owner of Boulevard Realty in Houston.\n\nIncreasingly, Baldwin said, he and other brokers are seeing insurance companies swoop in just as deals are about to close, making nearly impossible demands.\n\n\"A new roof, for roofs that are only seven years old, or 10 years old. They want trees cut down that are within 20 feet of the edge of the house. Oftentimes those trees are on the neighbor's property,\" he said.\n\n\"And when that can't happen, you can't get insurance, which causes the sale to fall through.\"\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out in commercial real estate, said Ross Markowitz, director of insurance risk management at AEW Capital Management, a global real estate investment advisory firm in Boston.\n\n\"We're having to really educate our internal teams,\" he said. \"Don't expect your buyers to be able to get the pricing of insurance that we have, so they'll probably [want] to offer less for the deal.\"\n\nMounting insurance losses\n\nThe new dynamic comes after several years of staggering losses for the insurance industry from natural disasters, including nearly $80 billion in insured losses last year alone, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\n\n\"It's directly related to climate risk,\" said Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at the nonprofit First Street Foundation, which quantifies climate-related risks. He said that insurance companies are increasingly interested in the organization's data.\n\n\"Insurance companies are responding to the fact that we're seeing more frequent and more severe climate events, and the fact that they're paying out more than they're bringing in,\" he said.\n\nLeash Yu, managing director of personal lines at Higginbotham in Houston, said insurance carriers are scrambling to maintain their financial ratings and, in some cases, just to stay in business.\n\n\"There's three things they can do. They can drastically increase rates, they can get rid of some of their risks, or they can severely limit the type of the new business that comes in,\" he said. \"And some carriers are doing all three.\"\n\nHurricanes, wildfires and extreme premiums\n\nThe crisis showed up first in Florida, which has endured three major hurricanes in two years. Florida policyholders now pay nearly five times the national average, according to Insurify. With multiple carriers either leaving the state or going out of business, the state's insurer of last resort \u2014 Citizens \u2014 has seen its policy count triple in four years, to nearly 1.2 million. Now, Citizens is asking regulators to approve a 14% rate increase.\n\nIn California, where at least eight carriers have left the state or limited their exposure, that state's insurer of last resort \u2014 the California FAIR Plan\u2014 has seen a 14% jump in policyholders this year alone, and a 137% increase since 2019.\n\nIn Louisiana, homeowners are paying roughly three times the national average, according to Insurify.",

Exit polls indicate that the party could secure up to 13 parliamentary seats \u2014 quite the feat given that it failed to win any in the 2019 vote \u2014 although the final result may fall short of this.\n\nIt follows a U-turn by Farage who had previously declared he would not stand as an MP in this election, choosing instead to focus on helping U.S. former President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nHowever, just last month Farage announced a surprise return to Reform UK and agreed to become its leader. The news gave the party a huge bump in popularity, with polls showing it was closing in on the ruling Conservatives.\n\nEuroskeptic Farage is best known for campaigning \u2014 successfully \u2014 for the U.K. to leave the EU. He led the UK Independence Party (UKIP) before forming the Brexit Party which eventually turned into Reform.\n\nBy 3:56 a.m. local time on Friday, Reform had won three seats, although 402 constituencies were yet to report. The party had also performed well in terms of vote share, securing 15.9% of the vote behind the Conservatives with 22% and Labour at 37.7%.",

        "body": "Members of the Youth Congress are protesting against the alleged government irregularities, paper leaks, and a sharp rise in perfect scores in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. (Photo by Firdous Nazir/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThis report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nCram schools are a well-known phenomenon in India.\n\nEach year, thousands of aspiring students, mostly from middle-class families, move to Kota, a city in the desert state of Rajasthan, where they spend two years rote learning to pass competitive entrance tests to a handful of universities.\n\nYet, the system has also exacerbated the social divide between the haves and have-nots, who are confined to the largely abysmal state-run education system.\n\nCompetition is fierce in India, whether for jobs or admissions to elite institutions. For the millions entering the labor market each year, the government has been unable to develop policies that will create jobs fast enough to absorb them all.\n\nThat means entrance tests and examinations are a high-stakes juncture in a person's life. They open doors to dreams or often close them shut permanently.\n\nSo, many do whatever it takes \u2014 including cheating \u2014 to get ahead.\n\nLast month, for instance, the government canceled the tests determining admissions into elite medical schools in India after reports of widespread cheating. The government said its cybercrime enforcement agency had indicated that the \"integrity\" of those \"examinations may have been compromised.\"\n\nThe head of India's National Testing Agency, the body that conducts the medical entrance test, was sacked following protests by students and opposition political parties.\n\nHowever, it wasn't an isolated incident.\n\nIn 2015, the Reuters news agency revealed that one out of every six of the country's 398 medical schools had been accused of cheating, citing government records and court filings.\n\nCheating has also not been limited to university tests.\n\nThe same year, parents and friends of students were caught on tape climbing school walls to pass on answers during school exams. That blatant case of cheating led to the arrest of about 300 people, in addition to the 750 students who were expelled.\n\nIncidents of cheating had shot up after a local government introduced a reward with seemingly good intentions. Students from lower castes, a form class system in India, were offered 10,000 rupees ($120) to get at least half the questions right. The financial reward meant teachers and supervisors colluded with students to rig the system. Supervisors took bribes to allow others to help test-takers, and teachers looked the other way since cheating inflated grades in their classes.\n\nTo fix this system, the Indian government passed a law to deter individuals from cheating with three to 10-year prison sentences earlier this year.\n\nBut perhaps the fault lies in the quality of education in the country, which leaves many unqualified despite holding qualifications.\n\nIndia has not taken part in the Programme for International Student Assessment, more commonly known as PISA, since 2009 when it ranked 73 out of 74 participating countries, beating only Kyrgyzstan. A half-hearted attempt at testing the country's education system in 2021 was aborted when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country.\n\nCould tech solve testing woes?\n\nIn 2011, a startup named Byju's saw a gap in the market and wanted to capture a slice of the multi-billion-dollar education market.\n\nThe company, which offers services ranging from online tutorials to offline coaching, attracted billions of dollars from investors worldwide during the pandemic when online education services were in high demand. In 2022, the firm was valued at $22 billion, enabling it to sponsor the FIFA World Cup.\n\nWith a lofty valuation, Byju's went on an acquisition spree. One of the companies it bought was an offline test preparation service called Aakash Education Services, which is still expected to IPO this year.\n\nAll of their gains are now being undone by what shareholders say is \"financial mismanagement and compliance issues\" at the company, leaving it at the risk of bankruptcy. However, the company's remote learning services, enabled by technology, has provided education at lower cost to the masses.\n\nSo more broadly, tech can hold the potential to provide a more affordable alternative to India's cram school system.\n\nBut a word of warning. Technology could just as easily enable further cheating, just as it has in the case of a Turkish student who was reportedly caught using artificial intelligence software to answer questions during a university entrance exam.",

        "body": "Visitors at the Summer Exhibition 2024 at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, which runs from June 18 to Aug. 18, 2024. Royal Academy of Arts, London / David Parry\n\nLondon has long been home to some of the world's leading art galleries \u2014 Tate Modern, Somerset House and the National Gallery are among the U.K.'s most visited attractions. CNBC asked a mix of artists to name their favorite public and commercial galleries to visit in London \u2014 large or small.\n\nContemporary galleries \u2014 and an upscale hotel\n\nMultidisciplinary artist Lauren Baker, who is exhibiting at the Venice Biennale until November, named contemporary galleries \u2014 and a hotel \u2014 as her favorite places to see art in London. \"Alice Black Gallery offers daring fine art with deeply conceptual works,\" she told CNBC via email. \"It's not all pretty, there's often some dark and strange pieces that get you contemplating the meaning of life,\" she said. The gallery is in London's Soho and represents artists such as Rachael Louise Bailey, who works in a variety of mediums including sculpture, and abstract artist Matthew Harris. Baker also likes Woolff Gallery in Fitzrovia, describing its collection as joyful. \"With a real focus on texture and tactile works and many sculptural elements, the works are fun and colorful, and you just want to touch everything,\" she said. The gallery represents artists including Apolline Bokkerink, whose work focuses on snowscapes and forests, and Joanne Tinker, who repurposes candy wrappers, discarded foils and champagne cork cages in her work.\n\nClaridge's hotel in London opened its ArtSpace gallery in 2021. Artist Lauren Baker likes to take tea at the hotel after seeing an exhibition \u2014 Claridge's is known for its Foyer & Reading Room, where afternoon tea is served. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nUpscale Mayfair hotel Claridge's opened its ArtSpace gallery in 2021, and Baker likes to visit it for its \"cool art crowd\" in the evening, or goes during the day and takes tea afterward. The gallery has its own caf\u00e9, or visitors can head to the hotel's grand Foyer and Reading Room for traditional afternoon tea. Artist and costume designer Machine Dazzle (born Matthew Flower), likes east London contemporary galleries Amanda Wilkinson \u2014 for its \"impeccable\" taste \u2014 and Maureen Paley, which has shown work from the likes of Turner Prize winning artists Gillian Wearing and Wolfgang Tillmans. He also recommends Fitzrovia gallery Niru Ratnam for its \"forward-thinking and intelligent exhibitions,\" he told CNBC by email.\n\nTate Galleries and Italian futurism\n\nLandscape painter Katharine Edwards, currently working on pieces inspired by the \"heat scorched\" vistas of Andalusia, Spain, will exhibit at Cricket Fine Art in London's Chelsea in September. Her top London galleries include the Royal Academy of Arts, for its \"wonderful\" exhibitions, she told CNBC by email. The gallery is showing its Summer Exhibition, which features more than 1,700 works chosen by seven Royal Academicians, some of which are available to purchase.\n\nArt handlers with Mark Rothko's painting \"Black On Maroon\" (1958), at London's Tate Modern. The gallery owns nine Rothko works. Rob Stothard | Getty Images\n\nEdwards also likes major London galleries Tate Modern and Tate Britain. \"One of my favourite rooms at the Tate Modern is the Mark Rothko room, showing Rothko's huge series of paintings which were made for the Seagram building in New York. They are almost architectural in structure with vibrating colour combinations. They are contemplative, meditative works which I find profoundly affecting,\" Edwards said. Multidisciplinary artist Komal Madar is also a fan of Tate Modern, and is looking forward to seeing its \"Expressionists: Kandinsky, Munter and The Blue Rider\" exhibition, which runs until October 20. In an email to CNBC, Komal recommended checking out the gallery's free exhibits too, including its vast turbine hall \u2014 the gallery is housed in a former power station. Madar also suggested feminist artist Judy Chicago's \"Revelations\" at Serpentine North in Hyde Park (running until September 1) and the White Cube galleries in London's Bermondsey and Mayfair areas. Edwards also picked the Estorick Collection, which displays futurist Italian art in an Islington town house. \"Futurism was a movement that came about in the early 1900s as a way for Italian artists (primarily) to express the energy of the modern world. There are Modigliani sculptures, incredible abstracts and rooms for rotating shows,\" Edwards told CNBC.\n\nA photographer's favorites\n\nArtists Gilbert Proesch and George Passmore at their Gilbert & George Centre Gallery ahead of its opening in April 2023. Joe Maher | Getty Images\n\nLondon-based portrait photographer Tom Oldham has taken pictures of musicians such as Dave Grohl and sports stars including Usain Bolt, and his project The Hopefuls aims to encourage young people to vote in the U.K.'s general election on July 4. The Photographers' Gallery in Soho is a favorite for its \"powerful and edgy selections,\" Oldham told CNBC by email, and he recommended its bookshop and caf\u00e9. He also likes The Gilbert & George Centre, a free-to-enter gallery run by artist couple Gilbert Prousch and George Passmore, for its \"three vast rooms showing different works, young and old.\" Oldham suggested a drink afterward at neighboring pub the Pride of Spitalfields.\n\nGallery staff with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by artist Andy Warhol at Phillips auction house on June 1, 2022 in London, England.

        "title": "'They want out': This company helps Americans experiment with expat living",
        "body": "Ikiah McGowan lives in Austin but hopes to move abroad within the next two years. She recently went on a 10-day scouting trip in Portugal with the travel group Expatsi.\n\nFor some people, the goal of traveling abroad is to go somewhere entirely different from home. For Ikiah McGowan, much of her international travel is fueled by the desire to find a place that feels like home \u2014 but outside the U.S. That's how McGowan, 39, recently found herself flying from Austin to Portugal for a 10-day scouting trip with dozens of other Americans dreaming of moving abroad. McGowan was part of the inaugural trip from Expatsi, a company that helps Americans move abroad through community groups and weeks-long guided scouting tours. For the March trip, travelers paid a discounted rate of $1,000 to spend 10 days in Portugal followed by $1,200 for 12 days in Spain. (Some chose to attend one leg of the trip while others stayed for the entire 22-day excursion.) These curated trips are more than a typical vacation. In each city, travelers partake in a half-day seminar led by experts to discuss the logistical ins and outs of immigrating, covering financial planning, visas, health care, real estate and other legal matters. On the remaining days, a local tour guide shows travelers around neighborhoods with a growing American expat community, or other locations where the group has expressed interest, and a realtor shows them properties for sale or for rent. More Americans could soon be exploring their options abroad. A CNBC analysis of U.S. Google search data shows a spike in users searching for terms related to \"how to move to X country\" beginning in mid-June. Interest swelled following the first 2024 presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on June 27. It's been \"a crazy week\" for Jen Barnett, co-founder of Expatsi, who says traffic to the site is up 800% since the debate. Americans' interest in visa applications to move and work abroad tend to pick up after big political moments, Masha Sutherlin, head of immigration at the global HR and payroll company Deel, previously told CNBC Make It. \"You're seeing some folks in the U.S. saying, 'I don't want to be in this environment, and I have choices to go to other places,'\" she says. \"Pair that with the digital nomad lifestyle and the abundance of digital nomad visas, and that opens up an entirely new scheme of working for Americans.\"\n\nA 'cheat sheet' for finding a new home abroad\n\nMcGowan has been fascinated by digital nomad living since 2019. She searched for and landed a remote job in the nonprofit world \u2014 a rarity just five years ago \u2014 and began solo traveling for long stretches while working. So far, she's traveled for extensive time in the U.K., Malta, Guatemala and Colombia.\n\nAmericans who dream of moving abroad are getting help from travel companies like Expatsi, which offers scouting trips to international cities. Courtesy of Expatsi\n\n\"As I've seen the way this country is developing, along with my intense interest in cultures that are different than my own, and a deep desire for for exploring the world, my interest in actually moving abroad grew,\" she says. McGowan wants to move abroad within the next two years, but so far hasn't found a place that really feels like home. She'd never considered Portugal until she learned about Expatsi from Tiktok. She started off with their online test, which identifies your top international cities based on preferences around your budget, ideal weather, whether you plan to work or retire abroad, what laws and policies are important to you, and other cultural factors. The test determined Portugal was among her top matches, and so McGowan booked her ticket to join the group tour in the spring. She says the price was well worth having the travel planning taken care of, plus access to local experts on everything ranging from financial planning to restaurants and attractions. \"It was like a cheat sheet to get to know Portugal quickly, and having someone else to plan the logistics was super helpful,\" she says. \"I didn't have to research the cool places to hang out in Portugal or what the cool neighborhoods are. That was already taken care of. I just had to get there.\" Plus, \"Portugal is a very hot spot among Black Americans, so that's also appealing to me.\" Both Portugal and Spain have been recognized as being good destinations for digital nomads and expats in general, and they're the top two countries where Americans are applying for visas to live and work, according to data from Deel. Expatsi fees cover the seminars, tours and one group meal and don't include travel or accommodations, though they're happy to give suggestions or facilitate people teaming up to book a place together. The flexibility means people can find accommodations that suit their budget, whether it's a hostel or a 5-star hotel, Barnett says, though she advises looking into longer-term stays. \"You really need to stay in an Airbnb or VRBO if you can,\" she says, \"because you want to stay in a neighborhood you might want to live in and walk to the grocery store and cook a meal and imagine what your life would be like.\"\n\nMcGowan estimates she spent roughly $2,300 on her trip including airfare and accommodations. The choose-your-own-stay model can help foster a stronger sense of community among the travel group. McGowan shared accommodations with four other women ranging in age from 22 to 65. She felt inspired by the conversations surrounding their desire to leave the U.S., which often involved \"family dynamics, health matters, politics \u2014 a lot about politics,\" McGowan says. \"To have that intergenerational time with other people with similar goals was really amazing.\"\n\n'They want out' for 'adventure and personal growth'\n\nThe inaugural trip-goers were mostly women ranging in age from 22 to 80 with a cluster around 40 to 65, Barnett says. Solo travelers made up the bulk of the group, though there were also a handful of men and couples in the mix. Most were either people who can work remotely as digital nomads, or are scoping out their options to retire abroad. Many of the travelers were more alike than not: \"They want out,\" Barnett says, and \"overwhelmingly it's not negative reasons; it's for adventure and personal growth. They know that they want something more out of life.\" Plus, finding a place with a high quality of life with a low cost of living is crucial for many travelers, especially retirees. \"Beyond that, they're really looking for a way of life,\" Barnett adds. \"It's walkable cities. It's a glass of wine. It's music in the park. They're seeking something special.\" \"It's not to say you can't find those things in the U.S., but a lot of times they're reserved for the wealthiest or people of a certain leisure class,\" she says. Meanwhile, in a place like Lisbon, \"you can't avoid it. Every building is beautiful and there are viewpoints everywhere and a glass of wine is $3. And this quality of life is available to everyone.\"\n\nExpatsi hosted 30 Americans for a 10-day trip to Portugal and 12-day trip to Spain in May. Courtesy of Expatsi\n\nFor having little background on the country before visiting, McGowan enjoyed her experience in Portugal. \"I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the locals and residents,\" she says. \"They were very willing to share their personal political views (we went days before a big election), their opinion on immigrants, and snippets about their personal lives.\" She says she's still friends with some of the people she met while on the scouting trip while exploring on her own and thrift shopping \u2014 her hobby and side hustle. Plus, \"the fact that English was widely spoken and provided on official signs, instructions, etc., is a testament to the welcoming spirit of the Portuguese.\" Ultimately, the trip helped McGowan figure out what she's looking for in a new home. \"Basically, I want Austin but outside of the U.S.,\" she says. \"I would like a small, non-pretentious, friendly, walkable city\" with \"great thrift stores.\"\n\nMore trips on the horizon",

        "body": "Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, left, and U.S. President Joe Biden speak at the start of the meeting of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) during the NATO Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, July 11, 2023. Paul Ellis | AP\n\nThe U.K. and U.S. have a lot in common \u2014 a shared language, history, democratic ideals and values. But when it comes to politics, us Brits do things very differently from our American friends. Those differences are plain to see as election campaigns ramp up in the U.K. and U.S., ahead of the British vote on July 4 and the U.S. ballot on Nov. 5. Of course, our political systems encompass different electoral procedures and processes, but there are other nuances to how the Brits and Americans do political races differently. Here are a handful of them:\n\n1) Campaigns\n\nBy the time a presidential election takes place in the United States, the electorate will have already endured months of seemingly endless electioneering \u2014 with the entire election campaign process from candidacies and the campaign trail to the actual presidential election and inauguration taking up to two years. In the U.K., the time frame between a prime minister calling a general election to the actual vote is just six weeks. American readers might, very reasonably, read that and weep.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer boards his campaign 'battle bus' after holding a Q&A with students during a visit to Burton and South Derbyshire College in Burton-on-Trent, whilst campaigning for next month's General Election on July 4. Picture date: Thursday June 27, 2024. Stefan Rousseau - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty Images\n\nWith such a tight window in which to win voters' support, the leaders of Britain's political parties dash about the U.K. on campaign \"battle buses\" as they try to visit as many constituencies as possible to persuade voters to elect the local party candidate as a member of Parliament (MP). The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons (the British Parliament) usually forms the new government and its leader becomes prime minister. It sounds simple, and usually is, unless there's a \"hung parliament\" in which no political party wins a majority of seats. In that case, the largest party can either form a minority government or enter into a coalition government of two or more parties. Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King's College London, told CNBC that there are many historical and structural differences between the countries when it comes to politics, and reasons why American campaigns are so much longer. \"The hugeness of the election in the U.S. is a function of the massive amounts of money at play to some degree. You do have to have these long periods of fundraising alongside campaigning and we just have completely different rules and structures around that.\"\n\n2) Election spending and ads\n\nMoney is certainly one of biggest differences between U.K. general elections and U.S. presidential elections. Stateside, billions of dollars can be fundraised and spent on campaign activities and political ads, far above that spent in the U.K. (after all, the parties in Britain only have six weeks in which to spend the money!). For a Brit, the money raised and spent by Republicans and Democrats during election campaigns is eye-watering. In April, the U.S. Federal Election Commission released data that showed that during the first 12 months of the 2024 election cycle (covering 2023), presidential candidates collected $374.9 million and disbursed $270.8 million, while political parties received $684.5 million and spent $595 million, and political action committees raised $3.7 billion and spent $3.1 billion, according to campaign finance reports filed with the commission. A number of political action committees, or PACs, raise money and make direct contributions to candidates' campaigns or parties. In the case of \"super PACs,\" committees raise and spend an unlimited amount of money in support of their preferred candidates, often funding large-scale ad campaigns.\n\nFormer U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures during a campaign event in Philadelphia on June 22, 2024. Tom Brenner | Reuters\n\nIn the U.K., meanwhile, the Electoral Commission sets out strict rules on spending limits for political parties contesting the general election in Great Britain (made up of England, Wales and Scotland). In England, for example, the limit is whichever the greater is of \u00a31,458,440 ($1,845,098) or \u00a354,010 times the number of seats the party is contesting in each part of Britain. Parties can be fined, and often are, for breaching those limits. In the U.K., political advertising on TV and radio is not allowed, so U.K. voters are subjected to the somewhat quaint \"party political broadcasts\" during election campaigns. That's where parties are allocated broadcast slots, free of charge, on radio and TV channels in which they can set out their election pledges. The broadcasts are sporadic, however, and easy to miss, unlike the thousands of ads in the U.S.\n\n3) 'We don't do God'\n\nYou will never hear a British politician \u2014 at least not a mainstream one \u2014 mentioning God in a political speech or campaign. Ever. Religion, in general, is kept separate from politics in the U.K., a multifaith country but also one in which religious belief is declining, particularly among younger generations. Just under half (49%) of Britons surveyed in 2022 said they believed in God \u2014 down from three-quarters (75%) in 1981, according to a study by King's College London published last year. While it's common to hear U.S. politicians proclaim \"God bless America,\" jaws would drop in the U.K. if a British politician made such an expression of faith in a political speech. Political aides say the subject is better left alone.\n\nBritain's then-Prime Minister Tony Blair (R) and his official spokesperson Alastair Campbell, leave the Inverness Royal Academy after meeting schoolchildren there, in 2001. Ben Curtis - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty Images\n\nAlastair Campbell, who served as the Labour Party's director of communications and strategy under former Prime Minister Tony Blair, reportedly interjected with the now famous phrase \"we don't do God,\" when Blair, then a member of the Church of England, was asked about his faith while in power. On another occasion, Blair was reportedly keen on ending a speech with the phrase \"God bless Britain\" but later said he was advised against it, noting that \"one of the civil servants said in a very po-faced way 'I just remind you prime minister, this is not America' in this very disapproving tone, so I gave up the idea.\" Blair converted to Catholicism on leaving office in 2007. An aversion to mixing politics and personal belief still runs deep in British public life, Dan Stevens, professor of politics at Exeter University, told CNBC, unlike in the U.S. \"They're just a much more religious society than we are. The U.K., along with much of Western Europe, is just so secular it's just not even something worth talking about. Whereas in America, although it is secularizing, particularly among younger people ... there is still this need for political candidates, including people like Donald Trump, to espouse some kind of religion to earn the electorate's trust.\"\n\n4) Age is just a number\n\nU.K. voters have been hearing a lot in the press about how U.S. election debates have focused on incumbent President Joe Biden's age. Indeed, British politicians look like whippersnappers when compared with the 81-year-old president and 78-year-old Republican candidate Trump.\n\nDemocratic Party presidential candidate U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican presidential candidate former U.S. President Donald Trump speak during a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024 in a combination photo. Brian Snyder | Reuters\n\nIncumbent British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is a youngster in comparison, at a mere 44 years old while Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party and, polls suggest, the man likely to become the next prime minister, is \"only\" 61. \"There are so much older candidates in the U.S.,\" the Policy Institute's Duffy told CNBC, describing it to a \"gerontocracy trend\" in which society is governed by old people. \"It's very different from around the world where we're actually seeing a decline in the age of world leaders.\" In the U.S., the age of the candidates reflects the decades it takes to build \"political capital and connections,\" Duffy said. With support for Biden shaken by his poor performance in a televised debate with Trump, it's that political capital and connections that appear to be keeping Biden's election campaign alive.\n\nAnother point of difference in British elections, and politics in general, is that \"morality issues\" are not prominent points of debate, dissent or divergence. Unlike the U.S., where the abortion debate, gun control and gay marriage are sources of contention, those debates are not hot topics in the U.K. where abortion is legal, gun ownership is rare and heavily restricted (critics would argue the U.K. has a knife crime problem instead), and gay marriage is (aside from among some members of the clergy) uncontested.\n\nAttendees hold large Pride flag at the 2023 LA Pride Parade on June 11, 2023 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images) Rodin Eckenroth | Getty Images\n\nSimilarly, \"identity politics\" and \"culture wars\" \u2014 the umbrella term for conflicts between often opposed political groupings with different cultural values and beliefs \u2014 are not so prominent in the U.K. But the U.K. does have our \"moments\" \u2014 the topics of immigration, transgender rights, the U.K.'s relationship with the European Union (yes, Brexit is still \"a thing\" eight years after a referendum on EU membership) and assisted dying are hot topics where divisions are evident among the British press and public. Still, such issues are seen as \"more of a personal rather than a party issue\" in the U.K., according to John Curtice, a top U.K. polling expert who has studied British social attitudes extensively. \"Moral issues of life and death are indeed taken out of our party politics, but other aspects of the argument between social liberals and social conservatives are not taken out, and it's become more important,\" he told CNBC.\n\n6) 'Absurd' diversions\n\nBritish political experts note that, unlike in the U.S., where broad political debates tend to remain the key focus, U.K. election campaigns can see more minor or fringe issues dominate the short election campaign. A betting scandal has erupted in Britain in recent weeks, for example, after several candidates for the Conservative Party, and a candidate for the opposing Labour Party, were found to have placed bets on the date of the general election before it was officially announced, and its outcome, leading to accusations of impropriety in public office. It's uncertain what amounts were staked, and those accused deny wrongdoing, though investigations have been launched by the U.K.'s gambling watchdog and the police.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (L) meets with a British D-Day veteran during the UK Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion's commemorative ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the World War II \"D-Day\" Allied landings in Normandy, at the World War II British Normandy Memorial near the village of Ver-sur-Mer, which overlooks Gold Beach and Juno Beach in northwestern France, on June 6, 2024.

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump, left, and President Joe Biden face off in the first debate of the 2024 presidential campaign, in Atlanta, June 27, 2024. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nThe recent U.S. presidential debate saw both candidates trade barbs related to the economy. High pandemic-era inflation was among the grievances. \"He caused the inflation,\" Trump said of Biden during the June 27 debate. \"I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation,\" he added. Biden countered by saying inflation was low during Trump's term because the economy \"was flat on its back.\" \"He decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy,\" Biden said.\n\nwatch now\n\nBut the cause of inflation isn't so black-and-white, economists say. In fact, Biden and Trump are not responsible for much of the inflation consumers have experienced in recent years, they said.\n\n'Neither Trump nor Biden is to blame'\n\nGlobal events beyond Trump's or Biden's control wreaked havoc on supply-and-demand dynamics in the U.S. economy, fueling higher prices, economists said. There were other factors, too. The Federal Reserve, which acts independently from the Oval Office, was slow to act to contain hot inflation, for example. Some Biden and Trump policies such as pandemic relief packages also likely played a role, as might have so-called \"greedflation.\" \"I don't think it's a simple yes/no kind of answer,\" said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank. \"In general, presidents get more credit and blame for the economy than they deserve,\" he said. More from Personal Finance:\n\nTrump may roll back student loan forgiveness programs if elected\n\nWhat a Supreme Court ruling could mean for Biden's 'billionaire tax'\n\nBiden, Trump accuse each other of ruining Social Security, Medicare That Biden is seen as stoking high inflation is due somewhat to optics: He took office in early 2021, around the time inflation spiked notably, economists said. Likewise, the Covid-19 pandemic plunged the U.S. into a severe recession during Trump's tenure, pulling the consumer price index to near zero in spring 2020 as unemployment ballooned and consumers cut spending. \"In my view, neither Trump nor Biden is to blame for the high inflation,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The blame goes to the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe big reasons inflation spiked\n\nInflation has many tentacles. At a high level, hot inflation is largely an issue of mismatched supply and demand. The pandemic upended the typical dynamics. For one, it disrupted global supply chains. There were labor shortages: Illness sidelined workers. Child-care centers closed, making it hard for parents to work. Others were worried about getting sick on the job. A decline in immigration also reduced worker supply, economists said. China shut down factories and cargo ships couldn't be unloaded at ports, for example, reducing the supply of goods. Meanwhile, consumers changed their buying patterns. They bought more physical stuff such as living room furniture and desks for their home offices as they spent more time indoors \u2014 a departure from pre-pandemic norms, when Americans tended to spend more money on services such as dining out, travel, and going to movies and concerts.\n\nCargo containers sit stacked on ships at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s busiest container port, in San Pedro, California, on Oct. 15, 2021. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nHigh demand, which boomed when the U.S. economy reopened broadly, coupled with goods shortages fueled higher prices. There were other related factors, too. For example, automakers didn't have enough semiconductor chips necessary to build cars, while rental car companies sold off their fleets because they didn't think the recession would be short-lived, making it pricier to rent when the economy rebounded quickly, Wessel said. As Covid cases were hitting record highs heading into 2022, further disrupting supply chains, Russia's war in Ukraine \"supercharged\" inflation by stoking higher prices for commodities such as oil and food around the world, Zandi said. As a result, global inflation hit a level \"higher than seen in several decades,\" the International Monetary Fund wrote in October 2022. \"We only have to look at the still high inflation rates in most other advanced economies to see that most of this inflation period was really about global trends ... rather than about the specific policy actions of any given government (though they did of course play some role),\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist for Capital Economics, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nBig spending bills' impact 'only clear in hindsight'\n\nHowever, Biden and Trump aren't entirely without fault: They greenlit additional government spending in the pandemic era that contributed to inflation, for example, economists said. For example, the American Rescue Plan \u2014 the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Biden signed in March 2021\u2014 offered $1,400 stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and a larger child tax credit to households, in addition to other relief. The policy led to \"some good things,\" such as a strong job market and low unemployment, said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. But its magnitude was greater than the U.S. economy needed at the time, serving to raise prices by putting more money in consumers' pockets, which fueled demand, he said. \"I do think President Biden bears some responsibility for the inflation that we've been living through for the past few years,\" Strain said.\n\nHe estimated the American Rescue Plan added about 2 percentage points to underlying inflation. The consumer price index peaked around 9% in June 2022, the highest since 1981. It's since declined to 3.3% as of May 2024. The Federal Reserve \u2014 the U.S. central bank \u2014 aims for a long-term inflation rate near 2%. \"I think if it weren't for the American Rescue Plan, the U.S. still would have had inflation,\" Strain added. \"So I think it's important not to overstate the situation.\" However, Zandi viewed the ARP's inflationary impact as \"good\" and \"desirable,\" bringing the economy back to the Fed's long-term target inflation rate after a prolonged period of below-average inflation. Trump had also authorized two stimulus packages, in March and December 2020, worth about $3 trillion. These so-called \"fiscal policy\" responses were insurance against a lousy economic recovery, perhaps overshooting after the U.S.' lackluster response to the Great Recession that mired the nation in high unemployment for years, Wessel said. That the U.S. issued perhaps too much stimulus was the presidents' fault but \"only clear in hindsight,\" he said. Biden and Trump also enacted other policies that may contribute to higher prices, economists said. For example, Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and several goods from China, which Biden largely kept intact. Biden also set new import taxes on Chinese goods such as electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\nThe Fed and 'greedflation'",

        "body": "Pictured here is a stone with tungsten ore inside a mine in Germany run by Saxony Minerals and Exploration. Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China dominates the supply chain for many of the world's critical minerals, but so far it's held off on sweeping restrictions on at least one: tungsten. The metal is nearly as hard as diamond and has a high energy density. That's made tungsten an important material in weapons, autos, electric car batteries, semiconductors and industrial cutting machines. Chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia both use the metal. \"I don't expect any saber-rattling over tungsten,\" said Lewis Black, CEO of Canada-based Almonty Industries, which is spending at least $75 million to reopen a tungsten mine in South Korea later this year. \"If you get too belligerent about diversification, [it becomes a situation that's] biting the hand that feeds you,\" he said, adding that \"tungsten has always been a diplomatic metal.\" While the Biden administration raised tariffs on imports of tungsten in May, China this past weekend did not include the metal in new regulations for boosting its oversight of domestic rare earths production.\n\nBut China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs... They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise. Lewis Black CEO of Almonty\n\n\"The tariffs were more of a warning shot, as Biden only put tariffs on three of the 25 strategic metals China exports,\" Black said. \"But China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs, unlike in the past when they restricted some exports of rare earths. They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise.\" Asked last month if China would retaliate to the latest U.S. tariffs on tungsten, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong didn't announce countermeasures. Instead, he called on the U.S. to remove the additional duties. Commodity price reporting and analytics company Fastmarkets pointed out earlier this year that China has reduced national production quotas for its tungsten mines due to environmental restrictions.\n\nDiversifying away from China\n\nStill, Black expects his company to benefit from growing efforts to diversify away from China. Almonty claims the forthcoming mine in South Korea has the potential to produce 50% of the world's ex-China tungsten supply. Demand for non-Chinese tungsten is already on the rise. \"We see in the U.S., in Europe, they ask their suppliers for a China-free supply chain,\" said Michael Dornhofer, founder of metals consulting firm Independent Supply Business Partner.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe U.S. REEShore Act \u2014 or Restoring Essential Energy and Security Holdings Onshore for Rare Earths Act of 2022 \u2014 prohibits the use of Chinese tungsten in military equipment starting in 2026, while the European Commission last year extended tariffs on imported Chinese tungsten carbide for another five years, Almonty Industries pointed out in a report. The House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party last month announced a new working group on the U.S. critical minerals policy.\n\nSoaring tungsten prices\n\nExpectations for higher demand and limited supplies of tungsten have pushed prices to multi-year highs, although they have tapered off in the last several weeks. Dornhofer said in an interview in late May that he was also seeing Chinese buyers increasing their tungsten purchases. \"Since the beginning of this year, they are not only asking for Western concentrate, but they are buying significant volumes, paying even more than Western companies are willing to pay,\" he said. \"Definitely [going to be] a game changer.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBack in January, U.S.-based research firm Macro Ops said: \"We're approaching an inflection point in tungsten supply. The US will quickly run out of stockpiled tungsten and flip from net seller to buyer over the next 12-18 months.\" The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on this story. Brandon Beylo, head of investment research at Macro Ops, told CNBC in an email there are only six companies in the U.S. with capacity to produce tungsten. He added that the U.S. hasn't produced tungsten domestically since 2015, meaning future U.S. supply must come from overseas. He said the firm doesn't own tungsten-related stocks, but that he's personally looking for ways to access the physical commodity. There are no futures for trading tungsten.\n\nOther tungsten players going to South Korea\n\nChina dominates over 80% of the tungsten supply chain, although local production costs are rising as the mines age, according to Argus, noting Chinese imports of the metal from North Korea, central Africa and Myanmar. \"This presents an opportunity for projects outside China,\" Mark Seddon, principal, consulting and analytics at Argus, said in a June 28 webinar. Other non-Chinese companies in the tungsten supply chain are going to South Korea. In February, IMC Endmill, an affiliate of Warren Buffett-owned IMC Group, signed an agreement with the Daegu city government for a 130 billion Korean won ($93.6 million) investment in a tungsten powder manufacturing facility, according to a local news report.

        "title": "How thousands of Americans got caught in fintech\u2019s false promise and lost access to bank accounts",
        "body": "watch now\n\nWhen Natasha Craft first got a Yotta banking account in 2021, she loved using it so much she told her friends to sign up. The app made saving money fun and easy, and Craft, a now 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana, was busy getting her financial life in order and planning a wedding. Craft had her wages deposited directly into a Yotta account and used the startup's debit card to pay for all her expenses. The app \u2014 which gamifies personal finance with weekly sweepstakes and other flashy features \u2014 even occasionally covered some of her transactions. \"There were times I would go buy something and get that purchase for free,\" Craft told CNBC. Today, her entire life savings \u2014 $7,006 \u2014 is locked up in a complicated dispute playing out in bankruptcy court, online forums like Reddit and regulatory channels. And Yotta, an array of other startups and their banks have been caught in a moment of reckoning for the fintech industry. For customers, fintech promised the best of both worlds: The innovation, ease of use and fun of the newest apps combined with the safety of government-backed accounts held at real banks. The startups prominently displayed protections afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., lending credibility to their novel offerings. After all, since its 1934 inception, no depositor \"has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits,\" according to the agency's website. But the widening fallout over the collapse of a fintech middleman called Synapse has revealed that promise of safety as a mirage. Starting May 11, more than 100,000 Americans with $265 million in deposits were locked out of their accounts. Roughly 85,000 of those customers were at Yotta alone, according to the startup's co-founder, Adam Moelis. CNBC reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the Synapse debacle. They come from all walks and stages of life, from Craft, the Indiana FedEx driver; to the owner of a chain of preschools in Oakland, California; a talent analyst for Disney living in New York City; and a computer engineer in Santa Barbara, California. A high school teacher in Maryland. A parent in Bristol, Connecticut, who opened an account for his daughter. A social worker in Seattle saving up for dental work after Adderall abuse ruined her teeth.\n\n'A reckoning underway'\n\nSince Yotta, like most popular fintech apps, wasn't itself a bank, it relied on partner institutions including Tennessee-based Evolve Bank & Trust to offer checking accounts and debit cards. In between Yotta and Evolve was a crucial middleman, Synapse, keeping track of balances and monitoring fraud. Founded in 2014 by a first-time entrepreneur named Sankaet Pathak, Synapse was a player in the \"banking-as-a-service\" segment alongside companies like Unit and Synctera. Synapse helped customer-facing startups like Yotta quickly access the rails of the regulated banking industry. It had contracts with 100 fintech companies and 10 million end users, according to an April court filing. Until recently, the BaaS model was a growth engine that seemed to benefit everybody. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks, startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer. The small banks that catered to them got a source of deposits in a time dominated by giants like JPMorgan Chase . But in May, Synapse, in the throes of bankruptcy, turned off a critical system that Yotta's bank used to process transactions. In doing so, it threw thousands of Americans into financial limbo, and a growing segment of the fintech industry into turmoil. \"There is a reckoning underway that involves questions about the banking-as-a-service model,\" said Michele Alt, a former lawyer for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a current partner at consulting firm Klaros Group. She believes the Synapse failure will prove to be an \"aberration,\" she added. The most popular finance apps in the country, including Block's Cash App, PayPal and Chime, partner with banks instead of owning them. They account for 60% of all new fintech account openings, according to data provider Curinos. Block and PayPal are publicly traded; Chime is expected to launch an IPO next year. Block, PayPal and Chime didn't provide comment for this article.\n\n'Deal directly with a bank'\n\nWhile industry experts say those firms have far more robust ledgering and daily reconciliation abilities than Synapse, they may still be riskier than direct bank relationships, especially for those relying on them as a primary account. \"If it's your spending money, you need to be dealing directly with a bank,\" Scott Sanborn, CEO of LendingClub , told CNBC. \"Otherwise, how do you, as a consumer, know if the conditions are met to get FDIC coverage?\" Sanborn knows both sides of the fintech divide: LendingClub started as a fintech lender that partnered with banks until it bought Boston-based Radius in early 2020 for $185 million, eventually becoming a fully regulated bank.\n\nScott Sanborn, LendingClub CEO Getty Images\n\nSanborn said acquiring Radius Bank opened his eyes to the risks of the \"banking-as-a-service\" space. Regulators focus not on Synapse and other middlemen, but on the banks they partner with, expecting them to monitor risks and prevent fraud and money laundering, he said. But many of the tiny banks running BaaS businesses like Radius simply don't have the personnel or resources to do the job properly, Sanborn said. He shuttered most of the lender's fintech business as soon as he could, he says. \"We are one of those people who said, 'Something bad is going to happen,'\" Sanborn said. A spokeswoman for the Financial Technology Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing large players including Block, PayPal and Chime, said in a statement that it is \"inaccurate to claim that banks are the only trusted actors in financial services.\" \"Consumers and small businesses trust fintech companies to better meet their needs and provide more accessible, affordable, and secure services than incumbent providers,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Established fintech companies are well-regulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds,\" she said. Furthermore, regulators ought to take a \"risk-based approach\" to supervising fintech-bank partnerships, she added. The implications of the Synapse disaster may be far-reaching. Regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs, and that will undoubtedly continue. Evolve itself was reprimanded by the Federal Reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships.\n\nIn a post-Synapse update, the FDIC made it clear that the failure of nonbanks won't trigger FDIC insurance, and that even when fintechs partner with banks, customers may not have their deposits covered. The FDIC's exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage: \"The short answer is: it depends.\"\n\nFDIC safety net\n\nWhile their circumstances all differed vastly, each of the customers CNBC spoke to for this story had one thing in common: They thought the FDIC backing of Evolve meant that their funds were safe. \"For us, it just felt like they were a bank,\" the Oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider, a tuition processor called Curacubby. \"You'd tell them what to bill, they bill it. They'd communicate with parents, and we get the money.\" The 62-year-old business owner, who asked CNBC to withhold her name because she didn't want to alarm employees and parents of her schools, said she's taken out loans and tapped credit lines after $236,287 in tuition was frozen in May. Now, the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out. \"I'm assuming I probably won't see that money,\" she said, \"And if I do, how long is it going to take?\" When Rick Davies, a 46-year-old lead engineer for a men's clothing company that owns online brands including Taylor Stitch, signed up for an account with crypto app Juno, he says he \"distinctly remembers\" being comforted by seeing the FDIC logo of Evolve. \"It was front and center on their website,\" Davies said. \"They made it clear that it was Evolve doing the banking, which I knew as a fintech provider. The whole package seemed legit to me.\" He's now had roughly $10,000 frozen for weeks, and says he's become enraged that the FDIC hasn't helped customers yet. For Davies, the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize Silicon Valley Bank last year, protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process. His employer banked with SVB, which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse, so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress. \"The dichotomy between the FDIC stepping in extremely quickly for San Francisco-based tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar, more consumer-oriented situation is infuriating,\" Davies said. The key difference with SVB is that none of the banks linked with Synapse have failed, and because of that, the regulator hasn't moved to help impacted users. Consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of FDIC protection, said Alt, the former OCC lawyer. \"What consumers understood was, 'This is as safe as money in the bank,'\" Alt said. \"But the FDIC insurance isn't a pot of money to generally make people whole, it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole.\"\n\nWaiting for their money\n\nFor the customers involved in the Synapse mess, the worst-case scenario is playing out. While some customers have had funds released in recent weeks, most are still waiting. Those later in line may never see a full payout: There is a shortfall of up to $96 million in funds that are owed to customers, according to the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. That's because of Synapse's shoddy ledgers and its system of pooling users' money across a network of banks in ways that make it difficult to reconstruct who is owed what, according to court filings. The situation is so tangled that Jelena McWilliams, a former FDIC chairman now acting as trustee over the Synapse bankruptcy, has said that finding all the customer money may be impossible. Despite weeks of work, there appears to be little progress toward fixing the hardest part of the Synapse mess: Users whose funds were pooled in \"for benefit of,\" or FBO, accounts. The technique has been used by brokerages for decades to give wealth management customers FDIC coverage on their cash, but its use in fintech is more novel. \"If it's in an FBO account, you don't even know who the end customer is, you just have this giant account,\" said LendingClub's Sanborn. \"You're trusting the fintech to do the work.\" While McWilliams has floated a partial payment to end users weeks ago, an idea that has support from Yotta co-founder Moelis and others, that hasn't happened yet. Getting consensus from the banks has proven difficult, and the bankruptcy judge has openly mused about which regulator or body of government can force them to act. The case is \"uncharted territory,\" Judge Martin Barash said, and because depositors' funds aren't the property of the Synapse estate, Barash said it wasn't clear what his court could do. Evolve has said in filings that it has \"great pause\" about making any payments until a full reconciliation happens. It has further said that Synapse ledgers show that nearly all of the deposits held for Yotta were missing, while Synapse has said that Evolve holds the funds. \"I don't know who's right or who's wrong,\" Moelis told CNBC. \"We know how much money came into the system, and we are certain that that's the correct number. The money doesn't just disappear; it has to be somewhere.\" In the meantime, the former Synapse CEO and Evolve have had an eventful few weeks. Pathak, who dialed into early bankruptcy hearings while in Santorini, Greece, has since been attempting to raise funds for a new robotics startup, using marketing materials with misleading claims about its ties with automaker General Motors. And only days after being censured by the Federal Reserve about its management of technology partners, Evolve was attacked by Russian hackers who posted user data from an array of fintech firms, including Social Security numbers, to a dark web forum for criminals.\n\nNatasha Craft, a 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana.

        "body": "Taylor Swift performs on stage during The Eras Tour on June 28, 2024 in Dublin, Ireland. Charles Mcquillan/tas24 | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nTaylor Swift's European tour was top of mind for Nikita Rao when planning where to go for her family's annual summer vacation. Rao, her husband and two kids, who live in Bethesda, Maryland, headed overseas this past weekend: They have tickets to the pop star's concert in Amsterdam on Thursday. The family built a weeklong itinerary around The Eras Tour event, spending a few days in London before making their way to the Netherlands for the show. They would have likely visited the two cities at some point in the future, but the Swift concert accelerated their timeline, said Rao, 43, who also saw a performance in Cincinnati last year with her daughter. \"My view on it was, we should do this \u2014 London and Amsterdam \u2014 because she'll be there,\" Rao said. \"If I can get tickets, that'll just make the whole vacation amazing,\" she said of her thought process.\n\nWhy Taylor Swift is unique to 'passion tourism'\n\nTaylor Swift fans gather outside Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium for a concert in Madrid, Spain, on May 29, 2024. David Benito | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nIt's not just the Rao family. Americans are flocking overseas to see Taylor Swift, perhaps the most prominent recent example of so-called \"passion tourism,\" according to travel experts. Passion tourism revolves (unsurprisingly) around people's passions. While place is also generally important, these trips are generally guided by personal interest, hobby or a cultural event, experts said. This isn't a new concept. In fact, there are many recent and upcoming examples: February's annual Carnival festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; April's total solar eclipse in North America; the 2024 Paris Olympics that start this month; and the ongoing UEFA European Football Championship (known as the Euro Cup) in Germany. \"Memorable events are driving travel trends, whether it is for concerts or sporting events,\" Mastercard wrote recently in its annual travel trends report.

But not for some destinations\n\nVacationers expect to carry summer travel debt\n\n5 ways to maximize your vacation days However, what distinguishes Taylor Swift concerts in the realm of passion tourism is the broad interest and enthusiasm among Americans who want to travel abroad, according to travel agents. \"I've never seen this excitement to travel to go see an artist,\" said Jessica Griscavage, a travel advisor and founder of Runway Travel. The most recent example that might come close is a Spice Girls concert in the 1990s, she said. Griscavage, who put together the Rao family's itinerary, also assembled a separate Swift-centered trip to Paris for a daughter, mother and grandmother. More than half of Americans, 53%, identify as fans of Taylor Swift, according to a poll by Morning Consult. About 16% consider themselves \"avid\" fans.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it,'\" said Sofia Markovich, a travel advisor and founder of Sofia's Travel. She assembled trips for two U.S. clients who had tickets for Taylor Swift shows in England and Switzerland, respectively. \"Just as Grateful Dead fans were known to follow the band from city to city to be part of a unique community, Swifties \u2014 often with friends and family in tow \u2014 have made traveling to her concerts part of the experience,\" Joshua Friedlander, vice president of research at the U.S. Travel Association, wrote recently about the so-called \"Swift Lift.\"\n\n'Inevitable' that Swifties will travel to new places\n\nAbout 15.9 million Americans traveled internationally in the first quarter of 2024, an all-time high, according to Mastercard's travel report. Consumers are also spending for travel at record levels globally, it said. Passion tourism generally provides an economic boost to host nations, experts said. For example, spending by tourists at restaurants, bars and grocery stores during the 2024 Carnival in Rio was 156% above normal, Mastercard found. During the solar eclipse, hotel sales within the U.S. path of totality rose 71%, it said.\n\nSpectators looking up at the solar eclipse at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 8, 2024. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nAbout 1.2 million fans will see a Taylor Swift concert this summer across four cities in the United Kingdom (Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London), according to a recent Barclays analysis. Each fan will spend an average 848 British pounds (about $1,073) on tickets, travel, accommodation, outfits and other expenses, amounting to a total 997 million British pounds (about $1.3 billion), Barclays estimated. Accommodation accounts for the largest outlay after tickets, followed by travel, according to the Barclays analysis. Searches for Airbnb stays in European cities during Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour dates are up about 70% relative to the same period in 2023, according to a recent analysis.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it.' Sofia Markovich travel advisor\n\nRome and Paris are traditionally among Americans' top destinations to visit abroad. However, it's \"inevitable\" that Swift fans will end up in a city they may have previously overlooked, like Edinburgh, said Christopher Nulty, global head of corporate communications and public affairs at Airbnb. When tickets went on sale last year for Edinburgh concert dates, searches for lodging in the city by Americans jumped 500%, Nulty said. A concert \"combines the opportunity to travel somewhere incredible with the opportunity to see an artist they love,\" he said.",

Regulators are \"still working on it,\" he added, but so far haven't raised any outstanding concerns with the fintech.\n\nStoronsky noted that Revolut's huge size has meant that it's taken longer for the company to get its banking license approved than would have been the case for smaller companies. Several small financial institutions have been able to win approval for a banking license with few customers, he added.\n\n\"U.K. banking licenses are being approved for smaller companies,\" Storonsky said. \"They usually approve someone twice every year,\" and they typically tend to be smaller institutions. \"Of course, we are very large, so it takes extra time.\"\n\nRevolut is a licensed electronic money institution, or EMI, in the U.K. But it can't yet offer lending products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. A bank license would enable it to offer loans in the U.K. The firm has faced lengthy delays to its application, which it filed in 2021.\n\nOne key issue the company faced was with its share structure being inconsistent with the rulebook of the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body for the financial services industry that sits under the Bank of England.\n\nRevolut has multiple classes of shares and some of those share classes previously had preferential rights attached. One conditions set by the Bank of England for granting Revolut its U.K. banking license, was to collapse its six classes of shares into ordinary shares.\n\nRevolut has since resolved this, with the company striking a deal with Japanese tech investor SoftBank to transfer its shares in the firm to a unified class, relinquishing preferential rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the resolution with SoftBank was first reported by the Financial Times.",

        "body": "Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.\n\n\"We are at what is widely viewed as a real inflection point in the evolution of technology, with the rise of large language models. Some are convinced that within three years almost everything we do as humans will be done in one form or another by LLMs and other AI tools,\" Griffin said Friday during an event for Citadel's new class of interns in New York. \"For a number of reasons, I am not convinced that these models will achieve that type of breakthrough in the near future.\"\n\nThe rapid rise of AI has had the world pondering its far-reaching impact on society, including technology-induced job cuts. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is among many who have repeatedly warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity. He has called AI \"more dangerous\" than nuclear weapons, saying there will come a point where \"no job is needed.\"\n\nGriffin, whose hedge fund and electronic market maker have been at the forefront of automation, said machine-learning tools do have their limits when it comes to adapting to changes.\n\n\"Machine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift. Self-driving cars don't work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do,\" Griffin said. \"Machine learning models do much better when there's consistency.\"\n\nStill, the billionaire investor thinks the power of advanced technology can't be dismissed in the long term, and he even sees cancer being eradicated one day because of it.\n\n\"The rise of computing power is allowing us to solve all kinds of problems that were just simply not solvable five, 10, 15 years ago,\" Griffin said. \"This is going to radically transform healthcare. We will end cancer as you know it in your lifetime.\"\n\nCitadel has long placed a great emphasis on hiring, not hesitant about putting responsibility into the hands of young employees and even interns, the CEO said.\n\nThe firm's internship program has become one of the most competitive in the country. More than 85,000 students applied for about 300 positions this year, reflecting an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%, which is lower than that of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"The people we hire today are going to be the leaders of Citadel not in 30 or 40 years, but in just a few years,\" Griffin said.",

        "body": "In this article META\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., displays the new Blackwell GPU chip during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference on March 18, 2024. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that \"concentrated\" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 make up about 31% of the index, it said.\n\n'A bit riskier than people realize'\n\nSome experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration \"is a bit riskier than people realize,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. \"Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,\" he said. \"You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.\"\n\nWhy stock concentration may not be a concern\n\nThe S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 \u2014 more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:\n\nAmericans struggle to shake off a 'vibecession'\n\nRetirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances\n\nHouseholds have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's \"rare\" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.\n\nThere's precedent for this market concentration\n\nAdditionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.\n\nThe stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when \"stocks did just fine,\" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. \"We've been here before,\" he said. \"And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news.\" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 \u2014 better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n'Sometimes you can be surprised'\n\nBig U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders \"generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity\" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven \"are not pie-in-the-sky\" companies: They're generating \"tremendous\" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \"How much more gain can be made is the question,\" he added.\n\nYou're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.

        "title": "Chewy shares fall nearly 7% as the boost from Roaring Kitty's new stake diminishes",
        "body": "The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares \u2014 amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.\n\nThe rally in Chewy shares lost steam Monday as traders reacted to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that showed meme stock trader \"Roaring Kitty\" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.\n\nThe SEC filing also included a section that read: \"Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat.\" There was an \"x\" next to a response that read: \"I am not a cat.\" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.\n\nThe stock rallied more than 9% on Monday, but it quickly fell into negative territory in morning trading. Shares ended the day down 6.6%.\n\nChewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. The shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.\n\nCNBC emailed Chewy's public relations team seeking comment on the new shareholder.\n\nGill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.\n\nGameStop shares fell more than 5% following the news.\n\n\n\nThere's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was founder and the first CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nIn a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's also been leading a pivot to e-commerce.\n\nThe investor was hit by a new class-action lawsuit filed Friday, alleging he engaged in securities fraud by manipulating GameStop's stock price through his online influence in May and June. The case was voluntarily dismissed on Monday.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.",

A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.\n\nAfter Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.\n\nNew charitable trust\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.\n\n\"It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,\" he told the Journal. \"There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.\"\n\nBuffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.\n\nHe told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.\n\nGreg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.\n\nBuffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.\n\n\"After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book \u2013 no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,\" Buffett said in November.",

        "body": "Honor CEO George Zhao (L) and GSMA CEO John Hoffman on stage at Shanghai Mobile World Congress during an awards ceremony on June 27, 2024. Honor\n\nHANGZHOU, China \u2014 The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,\" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"This has always been one of our value propositions.\" \"We say user data doesn't leave [the device],\" Zhao said. \"This is a principle we adhere to.\" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on \"server-based models\" for more complex requests. Apple said its new \"Private Cloud Compute\" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. \"Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,\" Zhao said. \"Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding.\" \"It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,\" he added.\n\nZhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a \"huge challenge\" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a \"stronger\" object compared to the individual using the system. \"In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,\" Zhao said. \"When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V2, the latest foldable smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, is on display at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.

        "body": "A photo illustration of the Chewy logo is seen on a smartphone and a PC screen.\n\nRoaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.\n\nChewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.\n\nThere's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nShares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.\n\nBut as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.\n\nOver the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the \"gamification\" of retail trading.",

        "body": "The drive-thru menu at a McDonald's restaurant showing various meal options and promotions, in Buttonwillow in Kern County, California, on 23, 2024.\n\nSearching for ways to lower labor costs, restaurants are hoping that artificial intelligence can take down drive-thru orders \u2014 but it will likely be years before the technology becomes widely available.\n\nThis year, 16% of restaurant operators plan to invest in artificial intelligence, including voice recognition, according to a survey from the National Restaurant Association. Most of the big spending comes from large chains, which have the capital and scale to make the technology work for their businesses.\n\nEven before the pandemic, labor costs had been rising for restaurants, leading operators to look to technology to boost their profit margins. Then Covid came, which not only accelerated labor costs but also led to a shift away from dining rooms and toward drive-thru lanes. California's decision earlier this year to hike wages for fast-food workers to $20 an hour has only made operators more inclined to embrace technology to cut their labor costs, which has so far helped mostly in the automation of back-of-the-house tasks.\n\nAt the same time, ChatGPT and other AI tools have fueled new excitement for generative AI in restaurants, though the industry is typically slow to embrace technological advances.\n\nOne stumbling block for the burgeoning tech came in June, when McDonald's told its franchisees that it would end its trial of Automated Order Taker, AI technology meant for its drive-thru lanes through a partnership with IBM. Once an early mover in the voice-ordering race, the fast-food giant now plans to turn to other vendors.\n\nThen there's Presto Automation , the AI drive-thru technology company which disclosed last year in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it uses \"human agents\" in places like the Philippines and India to complete orders. Presto interim CEO Gee Lefevre maintains that using humans is common in the AI industry and helps train the technology without straining the restaurant's workforce. The company unveiled a fully autonomous version in May. Still, the initial lack of transparency may scare off some operators.\n\nWhile some restaurants may be skeptical of using AI for drive-thrus now, adoption may increase in the coming months and years.\n\nThe tipping point for voice ordering is likely in 12 to 18 months, according to T.D. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles. That's when he thinks at least two of the nation's top 25 restaurant chains will go all in, expanding their small trial runs of the technology across their footprints.\n\n\"It's like third-party delivery a few years ago: Everyone was testing it, then when McDonald's went with Uber, everyone else followed with their own partnerships,\" Charles said.\n\nThis time, McDonald's likely won't be the first mover.",

        "body": "watch now\n\nIn the wake of 9/11 on an American military base in South Korea, then-Army Staff Sergeant Dave Yeager sat down at a slot machine operated by the Defense Department and made what he now calls the biggest mistake a budding problem gambler can make: He won. \"All that stress, all that tension, all the things that I was carrying with me in that moment went away,\" Yeager told CNBC. What was supposed to be entertainment, a way for servicemembers to relax, instead for Yeager grew into a disorder that would cost him his career, his financial security and his family. \"It went from, I was have fun doing this, to, I have to do this. It became an obsession for me,\" he said. In his book, \"Fall In: A Veteran with a Gambling Addiction,\" Yeager wrote about how he borrowed from subordinates, stole from petty cash and left his family in a lurch financially. Such vulnerability in a servicemember affects individual readiness and potentially even national security, if enemies were to exploit it, he pointed out.\n\nDave Yeager got hooked on slot machines when he was deployed to South Korea. Today, he counsels others about gambling disorder. CNBC\n\nYet, when Yeager said he confessed of that vulnerability to his commanders and his counselors, no one pointed the finger at his gambling, or helped him to help himself. \"The chaplain told me to go to bingo night on Sunday. That would give me something to do,\" Yeager said. \"And I'm like, 'I think you're missing the point here.'\" As of 2017, the Department of Defense operated more than 3,100 slot machines on U.S. military installations in a dozen foreign countries, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. The machines produce more than $100 million annually in revenue and is seen as a morale booster for the welfare and recreation for servicemembers akin to activities like golf, libraries and other entertainment. Overseas, servicemembers as young as 18 may be permitted to gamble. Domestically, slot machines are prohibited on military bases, though casinos are frequently located nearby. There are seven local casinos located within 20 minutes from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, one of the country's largest military installations. In 2018, when a Supreme Court decision paved the way for states to legalize sports betting, the opportunities for wagering exploded. Now, more broadly, all but four states permit gambling in some form. \"All of a sudden, we started to see a lot of people with gambling problems calling and asking for some help, usually within a year or two from the time that it expanded,\" said Heather Chapman, a clinical psychologist and director of the national gambling treatment program for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Diagnoses of pathological gambling disorders among servicemembers and veterans is soaring, with more patients receiving a diagnosis in the first half of 2024 as in all of 2022, according to VA research. Twenty percent of those referrals are women. \"It's not terribly surprising, because with accessibility and availability increases, we tend to see a rise in unhealthy engagement,\" said Dominick DePhilippis, deputy national mental health director for substance abuse disorders for the VA.\n\nServicemembers are more vulnerable than civilians to gambling disorders and may be hesitant to self-report, fearing they could lose their security clearance or to avoid the stigma attached to gambling problems, the VA research found. Studies have found the prevalence of problem gambling and gambling disorder among veterans to be as high as 10.7% in some parts of the U.S., the department said, though those studies have been smaller and typically regional, which leads to a wide variance among results. To address the growing concern, the VA operates two residential treatment facilities for gambling addiction and has a myriad partnerships with civilian facilities throughout the country, Chapman said. \"We are sort of the mecca of gambling treatment,\" she said. The VA began treating gambling disorders in the late 1960s, about nine years after Congress banned slot machines from domestic bases. The Department of Defense declined CNBC's request for an interview, but said in a statement there hasn't been any systemwide increases in resources to address problem gambling. It said a Health Related Behavior survey from 2018 \u2014 before the boom in sports betting \u2014 indicated that rates of problem gambling among servicemembers of 1.6% to 1.7% was in line with the incidence in the civilian population. \"DoD researchers are aware of changes in gambling availability due to new mobile and sports gambling options and will consider these variables in future military gambling research,\" a department spokesperson said in an email. The military is conducting a new survey, with results expected in the fall, the spokesperson added\n\nThe Department of Defense operates slot machines on military bases abroad.

        "title": "Peloton staved off the cash crunch that threatened its business. Where does it go now?",
        "body": "In this article PTON Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Peloton Bike inside a showroom in New York, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2023. Peloton Interactive Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on November 2. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nPeloton no longer faces an imminent liquidity crunch after a massive debt refinancing, but the company still has a long road ahead to fix its business and get back to profitability. In late May, the connected fitness company secured a new $1 billion term loan, raised $350 million in convertible senior notes and received a new $100 million line of credit from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. All of those are due in 2029. The refinance reduced Peloton's debt from about $1.75 billion to around $1.55 billion and pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldn't have had the cash to pay back. Before the refinancing, Peloton would have needed to pay around $800 million toward its debt by November 2025. If it managed to pay that, about another $200 million still would have been due around three months later. The term loan would have been due in May 2027. For Peloton, which hasn't turned a net profit since December 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters, the debt pile posed an existential threat and fueled investor concerns about a possible bankruptcy. Now that it has refinanced, Peloton has eased investor concerns about liquidity and has the breathing room it needs to try to turn around its business. The fact that it was able to secure these loans signals investors believe in its ability to rightsize its business and eventually pay them back, restructuring experts told CNBC. \"This refinancing is now putting us in a much better position for sustainable, profitable growth and just a much stronger financial footing than where we were before, and our investors saw that,\" finance chief Liz Coddington told CNBC in an interview. \"I think they believe in the story. They believe in what we're trying to do, as do we, and in the transformation of the business. And so it was just a great vote of confidence for Peloton's future.\"\n\nPeloton faces risks ahead\n\nWhile the refinance may have bought Peloton some time, it's far from a panacea. Under the terms, Peloton will now be spending about $133 million annually in interest, up from around $89 million previously. It will make Peloton's efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult. Coddington acknowledged to CNBC that the higher interest expense is going to \"impact\" free cash flow, but said that's partly why the company started to cut costs in early May. The plan is expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million. Even with the higher interest payments, Coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business \"materially grow in the near term.\" \"The cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that,\" said Coddington. While Peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy, some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails. Two of Peloton's largest debt holders, Soros Fund Management and Silver Point Capital, are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies. Since the Peloton loans they invested in are secured, they are near the top of the capital structure. If Peloton can't turn its business around and ends up in a position where it's considering or filing for bankruptcy, its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company. \"I would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic,\" said Evan DuFaux, a special situations analyst at CreditSights and an expert in distressed debt. \"I think that's just sort of a smart, opportunistic and kind of tricky move.\" Silver Point declined to comment. Soros didn't return a request for comment.\n\nMore cost cuts to come?\n\nPeloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago, but the company still needs to address the demand issues that have plagued it since the Covid-19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future. \"It really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time, but it doesn't actually fix any of the underlying problems at Peloton,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"Those are very different issues to the refinancing.\" Following former CEO Barry McCarthy's departure and with two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, now in charge, Peloton needs to decide: is it a content company, like the Netflix for fitness, or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment? So far, straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful. \"They're going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable, which parts are not, or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have, especially with the loyal following that they have,\" said Scott Stuart, the CEO of the Turnaround Management Association and an expert in corporate restructurings. \"Money doesn't fix everything, and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance ... the more problematic it becomes,\" he added. Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said Peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on \"bear hugging\" its millions of brand loyalists. He pointed out that the company makes about $1.6 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and sees more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business. \"The problem is, they lose money. How do you lose money if you're generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars?\" said Siegel. \"Well, you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth.\" He said Peloton could generate around $500 million in EBITDA if it cuts research and development, marketing and other corporate expenses. For example, Peloton's marketing budget is around 25% of annual sales, and if the company reduces it to even 10%, it would still be in the \"upper echelon of most brands,\" said Siegel. \"Their debt is scary on a company that's burning cash, their debt's not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of EBITDA,\" he said. \"They have a business that's generating a tremendous amount of cash. They need to stop spending it.\" In May, Peloton announced it would cut 15% of its corporate workforce, but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy. Peloton founder John Foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members, and McCarthy adopted the target when he took over. As of the end of March, Peloton had about 6.6 million members \u2014 woefully behind that long-term target. Since the company announced its cost cutting plan, McCarthy's departure and another disastrous earnings report in early May, Peloton has been largely mum on its strategy. It said that it's searching for a new permanent CEO, and the person it hires will offer clues about the company's direction. If it hires another \"hyper growth tech CEO\" like McCarthy \u2013 who had done stints at Netflix and Spotify \u2013 then Peloton will likely face the same issues, Siegel said. But if it taps someone different, it could signal a strategy shift.\n\nContent magic",

        "body": "Vehicles are offered for sale at a GM dealership in Lincolnwood, Illinois, on June 20, 2024.\n\nDETROIT \u2014 General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.\n\nThe Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIts EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.\n\nSales of GM's full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.\n\nGM's total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.\n\nGM's second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.\n\nAn unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.\n\n\"The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.\n\nGM, in a statement, said its \"dealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.\"\n\nDealers, including the industry's largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.\n\nAll six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six \u2014 Asbury Automotive Group , AutoNation Inc. , Group 1 Automotive Inc. , Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. \u2014 use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.\n\n\"The good news is \u2014 unlike other black swan events that the industry has contended with in the past \u2014 sales shouldn't be lost or severely deferred, but rather pushed into the third quarter,\" Caldwell said.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Toyota reported its second-quarter sales. The company's U.S. sales totaled 621,549 vehicles during the period, up 9.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nThe Hyundai brand sold 214,719 vehicles during the second quarter, up 2.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nKia, which reports sales on a monthly basis, reported a 6.5% decrease in its June sales. Its sales for the first half of the year were down about 2% to 386,460 vehicles sold.",

        "body": "Football fans watch the NFL Super Bowl XLVIII game between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks on at a sports bar in New Jersey on February 2, 2014.\n\nA satellite dish is no longer the only way bars and restaurants can air the National Football League's package of \"Sunday Ticket\" games.\n\nEverPass Media, the joint venture between the league and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners that owns the commercial rights to \"Sunday Ticket,\" acquired UPshow, a platform with the tech capabilities to allow commercial establishments to stream live sports. Terms of the deal were undisclosed.\n\nWith this acquisition, bars, restaurants, casinos and other businesses will be able to stream \"Sunday Ticket\" games. Until recently, they could only do so through a subscription to satellite TV provider DirecTV.\n\nDirecTV will remain as a distributor to bars and restaurants, however. EverPass signed a nonexclusive deal with DirecTV last year to continue to distribute \"Sunday Ticket\" games, giving it the ability to reach deals with other distribution platforms.\n\n\"More content is moving to streaming. Regardless of the streaming economics, it's become pretty clear that live sports is an important piece of that,\" said EverPass CEO Alex Kaplan. \"We're going to think about how to deliver a product and service to our customers that's becoming increasingly more challenging for them to sort of aggregate in a meaningful way. We're still in the early days ... but this is a big step for us.\"\n\nThe new distribution option will be available this coming NFL season.\n\nThe acquisition for EverPass comes as more live sports games are being offered exclusively on streaming services \u2014 a new frontier for business establishments that have long subscribed to traditional pay TV packages to offer live sports.\n\n\"Sunday Ticket\" is an integral sports package for bars and restaurants since it provides all out-of-market NFL games.\n\nIn late 2022, Google' s YouTube TV acquired the residential rights to \"Sunday Ticket\" for roughly $2 billion a year, a deal which runs over seven years. DirecTV had been the owner and exclusive residential and commercial distributor of the games since the package's inception in 1994.\n\nThis followed a deal for Amazon' s Prime Video to become the exclusive home of \"Thursday Night Football\" \u2014 part of the 11-year NFL media rights agreement worth more than $100 billion.\n\nSince then, the media rights owners of NFL games have begun to offer games simultaneously on their streaming services \u2014 and in some cases exclusively. Earlier this year Comcast 's NBCUniversal aired an NFL wild-card game on Peacock, the first time a postseason game was exclusively offered via streaming. Netflix also recently won the rights to air two NFL games on Christmas this year, and at least one on the holiday in the following two years.",

The median price fell 2% to $1.2 million, and prices for luxury apartments fell for the first time in more than a year, according to the report.\n\nThe price declines are a result of rising inventory of apartments for sale, which are also taking longer to sell. There are now more than 8,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan, which is higher than the 10-year average of about 7,000, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, the appraisal and research firm.\n\nManhattan now has a 9.8 month supply of apartments for sale, which means it would take 9.8 months to sell all of the apartments on the market without any new listings, according to Brown Harris Stevens. \"Any number over 6 months tells us there is too much supply and we are in a buyer's market,\" according to the Brown Harris Stevens report.\n\nThe falling prices and rising number of unsold apartments in Manhattan stand in contrast to the national real estate landscape, where continued tight supply continues to keep prices high. Brokers and real estate analysts say the strong prices in Manhattan post-Covid became unsustainable, and both buyers and sellers are finally capitulating to a higher interest rate environment.",

        "body": "Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.\n\nParamount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\n\nOne of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.\n\nParamount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.\n\n\"What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,\" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.\n\nA merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.\n\nWhile a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.\n\nMax has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,\" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. \"Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.",

        "title": "Inside Starbucks' plans to improve stores for customers and baristas",
        "body": "watch now\n\nStarbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' \"Siren Craft System,\" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. \"It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,\" she told CNBC in an interview.\n\nStarbucks Coffee shop in Krakow, Poland on February 29, 2024. Beata Zawrzel | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, \"My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient.\" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.\n\nThe Siren system\n\nStarbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a \"play caller\" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. \"One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,\" Young said. \"We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping.\" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. \"We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,\" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.\n\nStarbucks app expands",

        "body": "In this article SPR\n\nBA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBoeing Co. 737 fuselage sections sit on the assembly floor at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBoeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control. It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \"fully align\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.\n\nMounting pressure",

Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.\n\nThe DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes. The so-called deferred prosecution agreement was set to expire days before the door panel blew out.\n\nBoeing admitted in 2021 that two of its pilots defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration by concealing its addition of a new flight-control system to the planes before they were flown commercially. That system was later implicated in the two crashes.\n\nThe plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers. Cassell called the new deal a \"slap on the wrist.\"",

A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.\n\nAs a result, before \"Inside Out 2,\" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.\n\nWhile this audience came out in droves for Universal's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's \"The Garfield Movie\" and Paramount's \"IF.\"\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.\n\nAs the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.\n\nNext up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's \"Despicable Me 4,\" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.",

        "body": "Parade participants are seen marching during the 2024 Kentuckiana Pride Parade on June 15, 2024 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen J. Cohen | Getty Images\n\nPride month is winding down \u2014 and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. \"There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'\" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken \"a wait-and-see\" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. \"June this year has not been like the last five or six,\" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. \"The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,\" Ellis said. \"I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing.\" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.\n\nPride Month merchandise is displayed at a Target store on May 31, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe Bud Light and Target effect\n\nConsumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as \"tuck-friendly\" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is \"significantly lower\" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is \"committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round\" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.\n\nA sign disparaging Bud Light beer is seen along a country road on April 21, 2023 in Arco, Idaho. Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Bud Light has faced backlash after the company sponsored two Instagram posts from a transgender woman. Natalie Behring | Getty Images\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. \"You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,\" Reid said.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f.

        "body": "At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.\n\nFor 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.\n\nMost recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver \"The Blind,\" \"The Chosen,\" \"Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist\" and \"Waitress: the Musical\" to audiences. Still to come is \"Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.\"\n\nIn 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.\n\nFathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach \u2014 as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains \u2014 has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.\n\n\"Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.\"\n\nIn post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.\n\nSeason 4 of \"The Chosen,\" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.\n\n\"'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,\" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. \"It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.\"\n\nFathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.\n\n\"We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,\" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. \"These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.\"\n\nThis year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\" as well as the 35th anniversary of \"Steel Magnolias.\" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of \"Blazing Saddles,\" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" the 40th anniversary of \"Neverending Story\" and the 20th anniversary of \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nIt also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" the 35th anniversary of \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and the 30th anniversary of \"Pom Poko.\"\n\nAnd these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.\n\nFathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.\n\n\"Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,\" Bagby said. \"We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.\"\n\n4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.\n\nAudiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"Coraline,\" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.\n\nFathom re-released \"Coraline\" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.\n\nThat $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for \"Coraline\" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.\n\nWhat's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.\n\n\"New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,\" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.\n\nFathom reports presales for this year's screenings of \"Coraline\" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.\n\nBecause Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.\n\n\"[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,\" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. \"They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.\"",

        "body": "In this article F\n\nGM\n\nSTLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nGM launched 'EV Live,' a free online platform that connects electric vehicle owners or consumers who have questions about zero-emissions cars and trucks with an expert who can answer them. Courtesy: GM\n\nDETROIT \u2014 Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of \"electrified\" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. \"More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,\" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. \"There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are.\" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with \"electrified\" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. \"I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,\" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. \"The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.\"\n\nEV naming\n\nWhile consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles \"electrified,\" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular \"hybrid,\" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as \"hybrid EVs.\" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. \"Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,\" Waatti said.\n\nGM's 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV (right) next to a gas-powered Chevy Equinox on May 16, 2024 in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC\n\nSome automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the \"Wagoneer\" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer \"S\" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. \"I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,\" he said during a recent interview. \"It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.\"\n\nEducation is key\n\nOne thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. \"We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,\" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. \"We're trying our best to educate them.\"\n\n2024 Jeep Wagoneer S EV Jeep\n\nKia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched \"EV Live\" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as \"GM Energy Live,\" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. \"Each customer, in the end, is very different,\" said J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. \"I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,\" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.\n\nAutomotive alphabet soup The automotive industry has more powertrain and \"propulsion\" options than ever before. Here's a breakdown: Internal combustion engine (ICE): A \"traditional\" vehicle with an engine that's fueled with gasoline or diesel.\n\nA \"traditional\" vehicle with an engine that's fueled with gasoline or diesel.

The vehicle still drives like an EV instead of having the engine directly power the vehicle's motion.\n\nConsumer adoption",

        "body": "The budding trends in food sound like a return to the diet of cavemen: Fish is the hottest protein, honey is the flavor du jour and game meat is an upgrade to charcuterie boards. That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:\n\nHoney \u2014 as a flavor\n\nOwl Creek Organics & Natural Products' lineup of honey spreads at the Summer Fancy Foods Show Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nHumans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.\n\nTinned fish\n\nKrill Arctic Foods' tinned krill meat Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nIn years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.\n\nFish to go\n\nAcme Smoked Fish's Lox in a Box kits on display at the company's booth Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nExhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named \"satisfying snacks\" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.\n\nUpgraded charcuterie\n\nFossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nLike tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie \u2014 especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.\n\nPairing snacks\n\nWine Chips' Sel Gris-flavored chips are meant to be paired with sparkling wines Amelia Lucas | CNBC",

The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.\n\n\"We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport.

        "body": "In this article PFE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nKena Betancur | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nPfizer had a \"phenomenal\" first quarter \u2014 and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees \u2014 including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.\n\nNow, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees \u2014 all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation \u2014 about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts \"very, very painful\" and said it was \"killing\" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. \"And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,\" Bourla said, according to the recording. \"And we saw it, how the Street will respond.\" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will \"put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward.\" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs \"lightly\" and that the company is \"focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.\"\n\nWhat went wrong in 2023\n\nPfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.\n\nPfizer's Covid vaccine Comirnaty, seen at a CVS Pharmacy in Eagle Rock, California, Sept. 14, 2023. Irfan Khan | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nDuring an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion \"solely due to its Covid products.\" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a \"clean slate.\" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. \"So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove\" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a \"world-class oncology leader.\" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .\n\nA 'slap in the face'\n\nSome current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off \u2014 a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe \u2014 even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. \"It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,\" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks during a press conference after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium, April 23, 2021. John Thys | Reuters\n\nAll the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as \"disastrous\" and another called a \"slap in the face.\" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.\n\nReturn-to-office policies\n\nOn top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. \"The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,\" one current employee said.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building in New York City, Jan. 29, 2023. Kena Betancur | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nThose policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site \"wasn't made lightly.\" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was \"right for Pfizer's culture,\" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. \"Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,\" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.\n\nEmployee morale\n\nEmployee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described \"walking on eggshells\" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building on January 29, 2023 in New York City.

        "body": "In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho. Drew Angerer | Getty Images\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% \u2013 far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected \u2013 after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,\" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. \"Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.\n\nSince Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT \u2013 the retail-focused ETF \u2013 which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers \u2013 runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.",

        "body": "Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\n\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \"uneven\" consumer trends across the globe.\n\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\n\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\n\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\"\n\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \"increased macro uncertainty\" in the Greater China region and \"uneven consumer trends\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\n\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\n\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\n\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.\n\nDespite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.\n\nSales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.\n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.\n\nStill, Friend later warned of the \"softer outlook\" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.\n\n\"The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,\" said Friend. \"While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.\"\n\nNike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.",

The total was the lowest monthly gain since January.\n\nWithout the surge in leisure and hospitality hiring, the total would have been considerably lower. The sector added 63,000 jobs, easily the biggest gain among the categories that payrolls processing firm ADP measures.\n\nOther sectors showing gains included construction (27,000), professional and business services (25,000), other services (16,000), and trade, transportation and utilities (15,000).\n\nOn the downside, natural resources and mining showed a decline of 8,000, manufacturing lost 5,000, and information was off 3,000.\n\n\"Job growth has been solid, but not broad-based,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \"Had it not been for a rebound in hiring in leisure and hospitality, June would have been a downbeat month.\"\n\nThe pace of wage gains also moved lower for those who stayed in their jobs, down to 4.9% on a year-over-year basis for the smallest rise since August 2021. Job switchers saw a 7.7% increase, a number that also has been trending lower.\n\nThe bulk of job creation came from companies that employ 50-499 workers, a group that added 88,000 on the month. Small businesses contributed just 5,000. Geographically, 80,000 jobs came from the South, or more than half the total.\n\nADP's report serves as a precursor to the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count that the Labor Department will release Friday. That report is expected to show an addition of 200,000 jobs, following May's 272,000.\n\nThe two reports often differ, sometimes substantially, with ADP consistently undershooting the Bureau of Labor Statistics count.

        "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell announces that interest rates will remain unchanged during a news conference at the Federal Reserves\u2019 William McChesney Martin building on June 12, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed satisfaction Tuesday with the progress on inflation over the past year but said he wants to see more before being confident enough to start cutting interest rates.\n\n\"We've made quite a bit of progress and in bringing inflation back down to our target,\" Powell said at a central banking forum in Sintra, Portugal.\n\n\"The last [inflation] reading and the one before it to a lesser extent, suggest that we are getting back on the disinflationary path. We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy,\" he added.\n\nPowell spoke at a forum that also included European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Brazil central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto. The forum was presented by the ECB and the discussion was moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen.\n\nThe comments come with markets closely watching moves from the Fed and its global counterparts as inflation shows signs of easing and some central banks, including the ECB, have slowly started rolling back interest rates.\n\nThe Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed focuses on as its main inflation gauge, rose at a 2.6% 12-month pace in May. That level has come down steadily after being around 4% a year ago, though policymakers do not expect it to reach the Fed's 2% goal until 2026.\n\nWhile Powell said he sees progress on inflation, he's wary of moving too soon and threatening the downward path of price increases, which hit their highest pace since the early 1980s two years ago.\n\n\"We're well aware that if we go too soon, that we can undo the good work we've done,\" he said. \"If we do it too late, we could unnecessarily undermine the recovery and the expansion.\"\n\nRisks of moving too late as opposed to too soon have come into better balance this year as inflation has ebbed and the economy and labor market have stayed strong, Powell added. By contrast, the Fed spent much of the past year worried that cutting rates too soon and allowing inflation to resume its upward trek posed the greater risk.\n\nEarlier this year, markets had expected at least six Fed rate cuts of a quarter percentage point each. Market pricing has since adjusted to anticipate two reductions, one in September and another before the end of the year. However, members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at their June meeting penciled in just one.\n\nAsked if he thought the Fed might cut in September, Powell responded, \"I'm not going to be landing on any specific dates here today.\"\n\nHe also was asked about whether he was concerned about the political climate and specifically should Donald Trump, a fierce Powell critic, win the November presidential election.\n\n\"I am not focused on that at all, and that's not just a talking point. I really think that we just keep doing our jobs,\" he said.",
        "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed satisfaction Tuesday with the progress on inflation over the past year but said he wants to see more before being confident enough to start cutting interest rates.\n\"We've made quite a bit of progress and in bringing inflation back down to our target,\" Powell said at a central banking forum in Sintra, Portugal.\nWe want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy,\" he added.\nPowell spoke at a forum that also included European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Brazil central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto.\nBy contrast, the Fed spent much of the past year worried that cutting rates too soon and allowing inflation to resume its upward trek posed the greater risk.",

        "body": "In this article LEVI Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Levi's store at the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets in Florida. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nIn a lyric on her latest album, Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"denim on denim, on denim, on denim.\" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches \u2014 like shirts, skirts and dresses \u2014 that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. \"The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,\" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Levii's Jeans,\" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyonc\u00e9's chart-topping \"Cowboy Carter\" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.\n\nGass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular \"501\" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim \u2014 from head-to-toe. \"Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,\" Gass said on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now \"they're exploding,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDenim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street\n\nTo be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing.

        "body": "Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.\n\nBoth numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .\n\nAn important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.\n\n\"It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.\"\n\nThe Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.\n\nWhile the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.\n\nOutside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.\n\nPrices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.\n\nHowever, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.\n\nStock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.\n\nInvestors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.\n\n\"The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.\"\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.\n\nRecent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nThere have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.",

        "body": "People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.\n\nThe official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIf that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.\n\nBut even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.\n\nThere could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.\n\nShould the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.\n\n\"We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. \"That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.\"\n\nIndeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.\n\nThat steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.\n\n\"Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.\n\nCook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.\n\n\"We do expect softening in the real economy \u2014 not falling off a cliff, just softening \u2014 that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,\" Bovino said.\n\n\"Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,\" she added. \"Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.\"\n\nIn addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.",

        "body": "A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.\n\nDividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.\n\nInvestors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.\n\nHere are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nDarden Restaurants\n\nThe first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.\n\nDarden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nFollowing the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.\n\nSaleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.\n\n\"We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,\" said Saleh.\n\nSaleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)\n\nInternational Seaways\n\nNext up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.\n\nIn its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.\n\nFollowing meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.\n\nAccordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.\n\nNolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). \"We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,\" said the analyst.\n\nNolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)\n\nCitigroup\n\nFinally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.\n\nThe bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.\n\nFollowing the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.\n\nRamsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.\n\n\"The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,\" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.\n\nRamsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%. (See Citigroup Technical Analysis on TipRanks)",

        "title": "Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company",
        "body": "Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.\n\nActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were\" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.\n\nRapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.\n\nDespite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space \u2013 it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.\n\nWith a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.\n\nGiven industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.",

        "title": "'The Culper Ring': What George Washington's Spies Can Still Teach Us Today",
        "body": "NEWS ANALYSIS\n\nIn 1783, the American Revolutionary War ended. The 13 former British colonies, now the new United States of America, had won their independence \u2013 the freedom we cherish today \u2013 from the British king and his oppressive government.\n\nAmong the many thousands of American heroes who fought in the long seven-year war, there was one small group of men and women who history forgot.\n\nWhy? Because they wanted it that way.\n\nThe group was known as the \"Culper Spy Ring.\" It was a network of spies for General George Washington that successfully operated in and around New York City for five years without ever being discovered by the British.\n\nThe members of the ring knew the price they would pay if they were caught. Washington's first attempt at placing a spy on Long Island had cost Captain Nathan Hale his life. A graduate of Yale University, Hale was a schoolteacher. He had no training as a spy but volunteered anyway. Hale's mission to supply critical information to his commanding general failed. Within two weeks of volunteering for the assignment, he was dead, hanged by the British as a spy. Hale's body was left hanging for several days as a warning to other would-be informants. He was later buried in an unmarked grave.\n\n\n\n\"George Washington\" by Weidenbach, Augustus. (Image courtesy Library of Congress)\n\nHale's death touched Washington on many levels. He realized that more than just one man was needed to collect the military information he desperately sought. What he needed was a network of spies.\n\nIn November of 1778, Washington assigned Major Benjamin Tallmadge as his director of military intelligence. He had found his spymaster. But who were Tallmadge's informants? They were carefully selected from the friends the major had made while going to school on Long Island. The ring included Austin Roe, Caleb Brewster, Abraham Woodhull, James Rivington, and Anna Strong.\n\nThough Woodhull was Tallmadge's chief agent (code name Samuel Culper), Robert Townsend (codename Samuel Culper Jr.) was an important source who posed as a Loyalist coffee shop owner and merchant while working as a journalist. In his guise as a reporter, Townsend was able to obtain information from the British at social gatherings, according to Mount Vernon's website.\n\nThe Culper Ring successfully supplied information about British military strength and even possible plans to attack Washington's Continental Army.\n\nThe ring was also directly responsible for the arrest of Major John Andre, the British spy who had been plotting the takeover of the fort at West Point with his accomplice American General Benedict Arnold, the fort's commandant. Plans of the fort were found in Andre's boots when he was captured by members of the New York militia.\n\nBeing a good spymaster, Tallmadge kept the identities of his spies a closely guarded secret. After all, one loose lip, one slip of the tongue by anyone, could and would cost them their lives, and possibly even the lives of their families.\n\nAccording to MountVernon.org, the major developed a way to identify his spies with pseudonyms and invented a numerical substitution system to identify his informants rather than use names. Seven hundred and sixty-three numbers were used, with 711 denoting General Washington, 745 representing England, and 727 for New York. Tallmadge and his associates also wrote their messages using invisible ink.\n\n\n\nPortrait Miniature of Benjamin Tallmadge (1754-1835). (Image courtesy: Collection of the Litchfield Historical Society, Litchfield, Connecticut)\n\nThe identities of the Culper Ring were such a closely guarded secret that even Washington didn't know who they really were. As Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaegar noted in their New York Times best-selling book George Washington's Secret Six: The Spy Ring That Saved the American Revolution, \"several members of the ring (Townsend in particular) had been insistent that Washington never learn their names.\"\n\nEven after the war was over, the members of the ring kept their identities a secret. In April of 1790, Washington visited Long Island, including Setauket, where the ring had operated. The once-commanding general and now President of the United States reportedly visited with several members of the ring during his visit, but whether he knew who they really were, he did not say.\n\nOne member of the ring Washington personally wanted to thank was Townsend, who had risked his life almost every day for his country. But according to Kilmeade and Yaegar, \"Townsend never stepped out of the shadows to reveal himself to his commander-in-chief. It was a great honor to be sure, but not one that Townsend sought. He did not want praise or celebration; the greatest reward Washington could give him was simply a return to a quiet and unassuming life as a man subject to no king but God.\"\n\nTallmadge and the members of the Culper Ring took their secret to their graves. The public wasn't aware of the spy ring's existence until the 1930s. Townsend's identity as \"Samuel Culper Jr.\" was discovered in 1929 after a historian was going through Townsend's old correspondence. Rivington was confirmed as being one of Tallmadge's spies in the 1950s.\n\nEven today, there's still one spy who has yet to be identified \u2013 Agent 355. Some historians theorize 355 may have been a woman.\n\nOver the years, there have been numerous monuments and statues erected to Nathan Hale's sacrifice across the country. High schools, middle schools, elementary schools, university buildings, dormitories, a Revolutionary War fort, a U.S. Army installation in Germany, a U.S. Navy submarine, and even a town in New York bears his name. Hale was officially designated Connecticut\u2019s state hero in 1985.\n\nYet, there are no statues to be found of any members of the Culper Spy Ring. All of them deserve to stand alongside the many other heroes of the American Revolution. Under the direction of Tallmadge, the Culper Spy Ring risked everything to serve their new country in a war that had been deemed unwinnable by much of the world. After all, they were up against the British Army, one of the mightiest militaries on the planet at the time.\n\nAs Kilmeade and Yaegar wrote, \"They never sought credit, never received accolades, and never revealed the risks they took or the sacrifices they made to serve our country.\"\n\n\"The observation of (British) Major George Beckwith bears repeating: 'Washington did not really outfight the British, he simply outspied us!'\" the authors noted.\n\nSo what's the lesson Washington's spies can still teach us? The lesson of humility.\n\nThey protected one another by not revealing any of their wartime experiences, good or bad. They kept each other's secrets to themselves for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn this social media-driven \"Look at Me \u2013 Tell All\" culture that we live in today, it is a lesson from which we can all learn, and perhaps that in itself is their best epitaph.\n\n**Originally published July 4, 2021.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "'Our Flag Was Still There': The True Story of the Family That Saved the Star Spangled Banner\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 As we celebrate our country's independence and freedom, there's perhaps no greater symbol than the American flag, often called the Star Spangled Banner. Today, the original flag, which served as the inspiration for Francis Scott Key and the National Anthem, sits in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. and how it got there is an interesting story.\n\nAuthor Tom McMillan details that story in his new book, Our Flag Was Still There: The Star Spangled Banner That Survived the British and 200 years \u2013 and the Armistead Family Who Saved It.\n\n\"The song, written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, was inspired by the flag that flew at the Battle of Baltimore at Ft. McHenry,\" said McMillan in an interview with CBN News. \"After all of the fighting, Key saw it still proudly waving in the wind.\"\n\nMcMillan explained how the song is about Key figuring out who had won the battle.\n\n\"Through the mist he sees our flag,\" he added. \"Our flag was still there. There are four verses to that song and it's kind of sequential.\"\n\nAfter the battle, Commander George Armistead took the flag home as a souvenir.\n\n\"A complete violation of Army regulations,\" said McMillan. \"He stole the flag but it remained in the private possession of his family for 90 years. And no one really knew about it. That's why it exists today. His grandson gave it to the Smithsonian in the early 1900s.\"\n\nMcMillan's research even led him directly to some of Commander Armistead's descendants.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n\n\n\"I was, fortunately, able to track down some direct descendants of George Armistead,\" said McMillan. \"When you're an author you just write them cold letters. You don't know if they're ever going to respond. Fortunately, I've had pretty good success and one called me, one whose name was George Armistead \u2013 called me right away. It's a little strange when you're researching George Armistead from 1814 to get a phone call from George Armistead.\"\n\nThe family invited McMillan into their Philadelphia home and what he found there went way beyond the flag.\n\n\"I went to the bathroom in their home and I came down their stairs and I saw some things on the wall where you hang high school diplomas and things like that. And these items were signed by John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison,\" McMillan recalled. \"They were George Armistead's original army commissions. And I said, 'You can't have these in your house!'\"\n\nThey also had an original portrait of the Commander. McMillan was able to connect them with the Smithsonian where they've since donated many of these national treasures.\n\nMcMillan says he loved digging into the research for this book.\n\n\"I think to do it you have to love the research just as much as the writing,\" he explained. \"Writing is fun, but it's learning. If you weren't curious like sometimes people will come up \u2013 this is my fourth book \u2013 'why don't you write about this, why don't you write about that.' You have to love it. You can't just get an assignment.\"\n\nFor him, this was no \"assignment.\"\n\nBefore writing this book, he served as Vice President of Communications for the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\n\"I had a great career,\" he said. \"I was in the media before that but I always said that, you know, for a lot of people sports is their escape from their job so when you work in sports you need an escape from it so history was my 'sports.'\"\n\nHe says his hope for this book is that it deepens readers' appreciation for history \u2013 and our country.\n\n\"One of the curators said when we were working on it the last time that they viewed it as a metaphor for the country,\" he said. \"It's tattered, it's torn but it still survives and the flag survives if the country survives.\"",

        "body": "'The Dam Clearly Has Started to Break': Several Dems Tell Biden to Drop Out as Trump Rises in Polls\n\nPresident Biden's political future remains uncertain in the wake of his shocking debate performance during which he appeared confused and stiff, often unable to communicate effectively. While calls for the president to bow out of the 2024 election from members of his own party increase, others, including Biden himself, say he's staying in and will win reelection.\n\nWednesday evening, 22 Democrat governors met with Biden at the White House to discuss his future.\n\nAfter the meeting, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore told reporters the governors were concerned about Biden's mental health.\n\n\"When you love someone you tell them the truth,\" he said. \"I think that we came in and we were honest about the feedback that we were getting. We were honest about the concerns that we were hearing from people.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden listens during a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House, July 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said when Biden told the group he wants to stay in the race, they vowed to help him get reelected.\n\n\"President Joe Biden is in it to win it,\" she said. \"All of us said we pledged our support to him because the stakes could not be higher.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, during an all-staff campaign call, the president said he has no plans to drop out of the race, while the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated that message to reporters.\n\n\"The President is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race,\" she said.\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden spoke to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to assure them he plans to continue his race and capture the White House.\n\n\"He has done this outreach, he's having these conversations,\" she said. \"It is important to him to do so.\"\n\nHowever, Biden reportedly told at least two people in private that he's \"keeping an open mind\" about his path forward, and that his upcoming public appearances are critical to determining whether he'll remain in the race.\n\nCBN Political Analyst David Brody said it will be difficult for Biden to ease concerns about his mental health because his condition is likely to only get worse.\n\n\"The problem for Joe Biden here is that Democrats want to see him perform at a top level. And the reality is he's not at a top level,\" Brody said. \"That means he's going to have to be error-free in the next few weeks, let alone the rest of the campaign. And that's going to be a really hard climb for Joe Biden at this point.\"\n\nTexas Rep. Lloyd Doggett became the first congressional Democrat to publicly call for Biden's withdrawal, followed by Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva, possibly signaling the beginning of the end.\n\n\"I think what's happening now is that we're moving from the, 'Will he resign?' stage to the, 'When will he resign?' stage,\" Brody said. \"I think it's just a matter of time. At this point, the dam clearly has started to break. We've seen some elected congressmen, Democrat Congressmen, come out and say, 'No more, Joe.' I think that number will grow.\"\n\nA new poll from The New York Times and Siena College taken after Biden's dismal debate performance shows 74 percent of Americans believe he is too old for the job.\n\nThe gap between him and former President Trump has widened to six points, with Trump ahead 49 to 43 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, polls show Vice President Kamala Harris scoring two points higher against Trump, but still losing.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***",

        "body": "The words of the Declaration of Independence reach across time to speak to the hearts of Americans even after nearly 250 years. Here's the entire declaration that led to America's freedom:\n\nWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shewn that mankind is more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses:\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions, We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which the Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\n\nNew Hampshire:\n\nJosiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton\n\nMassachusetts:\n\nJohn Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry\n\nRhode Island:\n\nStephen Hopkins, William Ellery\n\nConnecticut:\n\nRoger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott\n\nNew York:\n\nWilliam Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris\n\nNew Jersey:\n\nRichard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark\n\nPennsylvania:\n\nRobert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, George Ross\n\nDelaware:\n\nCaesar Rodney, George Read, Thomas McKean\n\nMaryland:\n\nSamuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Charles Carroll of Carrollton\n\nVirginia:\n\nGeorge Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, Carter Braxton\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nWilliam Hooper, Joseph Hewes, John Penn\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nEdward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr., Arthur Middleton\n\nGeorgia:\n\nButton Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "China's increasing worldwide influence is a major debate in this presidential election year. It centers on whether the Chinese Communist Party is viewed as a friendly competitor or an enemy of the United States.\n\nRecently, investigative journalist and author Peter Schweizer detailed China's efforts to undermine America from within.\n\nSchweizer contends Communist China is at war with America, sowing chaos and death without firing a shot. He makes that argument in the book Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans.\n\n\"China has a strategy, they call it disintegration warfare that says, look, we don't want to have a kinetic fighting war with the United States because that would lead to all kinds of disruption and damage in China,\" Schweizer explained. \"So, we're going to try to beat them by not going to war, but by undermining them nonetheless.\"\n\nSchweizer believes that the Chinese Communist Party undermines America by employing the tactics of Sun Tzu, a fifth-century Chinese military strategist who argued that an enemy can be defeated without actual combat.\n\n\"They're doing this by sowing social chaos in the United States,\" Schweizer warned. \"They're literally killing Americans with fentanyl. All the Mexican cartels are the junior partners. This is a Chinese operation.\"\n\nLATEST: Unprecedented Discovery at Southern US Border Exposes Chinese Criminal Alliance with Sinaloa Cartel\n\nSchweizer claims to have found links between the Biden family and the head of a Chinese gang involved in Mexican fentanyl distribution, Zhang Anle, also known as \"White Wolf.\"\n\n\"White Wolf has a business partner who gave the Bidens in 2017 a $5 million forgivable loan that the Bidens have never repaid,\" Schweizer insisted. \"So, you literally have one degree of separation between the first family of the United States and this poisonous fentanyl trade.\"\n\nSchweizer believes that explains why President Biden has not been more aggressive in confronting China on the fentanyl issue.\n\n\"We need to remember that the bribery and corruption statutes in the United States say even if the actual politician doesn't get a dime, if his family member profits, that in and of itself is corruption,\" Schweizer said.\n\nAs fentanyl continued to pour across the U.S. southern border, the Centers for Disease Control released an alarming statistic: over 112,000 Americans lost their lives due to fentanyl overdose in 2023.\n\nSchweizer alleged it isn't only the Biden family that China is influencing. He believes China has financial ties with members of both major political parties in the United States, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Schweizer alleges that the family of McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, owns a shipping company called Foremost Shipping, which has grown and expanded due to its Chinese business connections.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\n\"If Mitch McConnell as a senator were to do or say something that particularly angered Beijing, they could destroy the family shipping business overnight,\" explained Schweizer. \"That's the kind of leverage they have and the kind of leverage that they use.\"\n\nAccording to Schweizer, the most surprising discovery in his book is the involvement of two Chinese billionaires in inciting division and chaos in American culture.\n\nHe argues that Roy Singham, the founder of Thoughtworks, and Joe Sy, the co-founder of Alibaba, have invested millions of dollars in radical cultural causes such as the transgender movement. Alibaba is a Chinese e-commerce company similar to Amazon.\n\n\"But unlike Amazon in the United States, this is a business that's closely wedded to the Chinese government,\" Schweizer explained. \"What's troubling about these actions is not only their support of the cause, but the fact that they don't actually advocate for these causes in China itself, which leads me to believe that they see it more as a disruptive force in American society than something that they actually embrace as a belief system.\"\n\nWhat can be done? Schweizer believes the country must first deal with Chinese political influence in Washington. After that, Americans need to be aware of what is going on. He said that if people stay informed and are equipped, they can win this war for American hearts and minds.\n\nMORE:",

        "body": "America's 'Explicit Covenant with God': How a Nation Pledged to God Can Save a World or Lose It\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Covenants are viewed as the most sacred and binding of deals \u2013 an oath that's never to be broken. America's earliest settlers made a covenant with God to serve and proclaim Him throughout the earth. These days, however, Americans appear to have forgotten this covenant and that can have dire consequences.\n\nChristian leader Dutch Sheets explained to CBN News how God's relationship with us is set by a sacred covenant.\n\nThis author of Giants Will Fall said, \"It's even what He based our salvation on: 'I'm coming to bring a new covenant through Jesus. The shedding of His blood ratifies this covenant.' It is a binding together that in Him is unbreakable.\"\n\nAmerica Began in Covenant\n\nEarly English settlers also wanted their new land to share such a binding covenant with God. Christian historian Eddie Hyatt, the author of The Great Prayer Awakening of 1857-58, said those who came to Jamestown starting in 1607 put it in their Virginia Compact.\n\n\"To propagate, to expand the gospel, the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to take the gospel to people who were 'lying in darkness and had no knowledge of the one true God.' They said that was the reason they had come,\" Hyatt stated.\n\nThe Pilgrims arriving in Massachusetts stated the same in 1620. Jerry Newcombe, the author of The Book That Made America, paraphrased what they wrote down: \"'Having undertaken a voyage for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith.'\"\n\nNewcombe explained of the Pilgrims and Puritans who followed, \"They came for God as opposed to coming for gold.\"\n\nHyatt says John Winthrop, leading 700 Puritans to Massachusetts in 1631, said it like this: \"'Others may come to the New World for wealth and furs.' He said, 'We have another goal, another end. We have entered into an explicit covenant with God to be His people in this New World.' And they wanted to be that city on a hill. They wanted to be a model of Christianity for the rest of the world to see.\"\n\nDavid Barton of Wallbuilders said as these early settlers wrote out their covenants, \"They were very cognizant of the fact that we answer to God. We need to get God at the center of what we do. If we do, He'll bless us. If we don't, we're in trouble.\"\n\nThese Covenants Became Models for the US Constitution\n\nThese early covenants pledged the signers to each other and to obeying the laws they'd form with God's guidance.\n\nAs Newcombe put it, \"This was something that would bind each man and each person to the whole community as an agreement under God.\"\n\nAccording to historian William Federer, such compacts became the model for the US Constitution, whose authors were also very much guided by their Christian faith.\n\nThe writer of the online AmericanMinute.com stated, \"George Washington at the beginning of the Constitutional Convention, he said 'the event is in the hand of God.'\"\n\nHow Has America's Constitution Lasted So Long?\n\n\"They saw the Constitution as being a very religiously-based document,\" said Barton. \"It was also a very covenantal-based document. We made a covenant. The Constitution is a covenant of these states.\"\n\nHe went on, \"The average length of a constitution in the history of the world was 17 years. So how have we gone 230 when everybody else was going 17? And so political science professors looked to see where the Founders got their ideas.\"\n\nBarton pointed out they studied 3,154 direct quotes from these Founders' political writings and discovered how much God's Word figured in them.\n\nHe summed up, \"The number one source was the Bible: 34 percent of all those quotes in those political documents, etc., came out of the Bible.\"\n\nSheets explains in his book Giants Will Fall that the makeup of the government was shaped by biblical passages like Isaiah 33:22, writing, \"Our nation's form of government was actually taken from scripture. 'The Lord is our Judge {Judicial Branch}\u2026Lawgiver {Legislative Branch}\u2026and King {Executive Branch}.'\"\n\nThe Founders put God first and foremost in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFederer stated, \"It says right in there 'appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world.' In this founding document, we appealed to God. We invited Him to be a part of this American experiment.\"\n\nThe Founders put Scripture on the Liberty Bell, Leviticus 25:10: \"Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof\u2026\"\n\nThe concept of this being one nation UNDER God harkens back to Jesus telling Jerusalem in Luke 13:34 that He wanted to \"\u2026hide you UNDER my wings, covering and protecting you.\"\n\nDire Consequences of Deserting Covenant\n\nWhat happens though, as parts of the nation don't want to be under God, disregard parts of the Constitution, and no longer honor sacred oaths?\n\nSheets warned, \"We have walked away from covenant with Him.\"\n\nAnd even from the marriage covenant, with the divorce rate soaring 302 percent in the 20th century.\n\nNewcombe argued, \"A lot of the things that we're experiencing in America today are because we've disregarded God's covenant.\"\n\nAmerica, once the number one exporter of the Gospel, is now the number one importer of illegal drugs and the number one exporter of pornography.\n\nNewcombe explained God warned about this, saying, \"'Obey me then I will bless you. But if you disobey me, I will remove my blessing.'\"\n\nSo Much Is on the Line\n\nIf America really is to be the place from which the Gospel is spread to the whole world, then the salvation of billions hangs in the balance.\n\nSheets believes there's hope, but only if Americans return to honoring their covenant with God, because that makes us His family.\n\nSheets gave an example, saying, \"If the kids across the street I don't know, if they do something evil or wrong, I feel no responsibility to try to bring them back into the fold, because I'm not in covenant with them. I'm not in that relationship. God is the same way.\"\n\nBarton pointed out the long-suffering faithfulness of the Lord, saying, \"We're told in Psalm 105 He keeps His covenant for a thousand generations.\"\n\nSheets added, \"I don't think there's a stronger force in the world.\"\n\nSo there's a chance the nation can still someday completely fulfill the prophecy of destiny Jamestown chaplain Robert Hunt said in 1607 as he came ashore in Virginia, just a few miles from where the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s headquarters are located.\n\nHyatt explained, \"He made this declaration which I believe was prophetic. He said, 'From these very shores the Gospel shall go forth, not only to this New World but to all the world.' And that was just not very far from CBN!\"\n\nIt just takes getting back to covenant. As Joel 2:13 says, \"Now return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in loving-kindness.\"",

He said both Democrats and Republicans were once not too far apart and could find common ground.\n\nToday, he believes the dynamic is quite different.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a time now where it\u2019s hard to find common ground with people who believe that we\u2019re an evil country \u2026 who believe that America was built on stealing land from people to whom it belonged and therefore we should give it back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have that much of a fundamental difference, it\u2019s really hard to find common ground and find that sort of center of governing.\u201d\n\nHuckabee also shared his biggest fears about what might unfold policy-wise in November if former President Donald Trump isn\u2019t the victor.\n\n\u201cIf he does not win \u2026 I think what we\u2019re going to see is an accelerated effort on the part of the government to go after those of us that have been the targets already,\u201d he said, noting examples of parents being painted in a negative light for speaking out about objectionable content. \u201cIf [a] mother is labeled [a] domestic terrorist because she spoke up at a school board meeting and that\u2019s already happening, what happens in the next four years when a government thinks that it now has an unbridled right to go after all of its political enemies?\u201d\n\nHuckabee expressed concerns that people will be prosecuted and pursued, using Trump\u2019s legal woes as an example of what he says could happen to others.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in the next four years, I think, is disturbing,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe courtroom then becomes the new public forum, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to find increasing numbers of pro-life people, Christian people, pro-Israel people, pro-freedom people finding themselves taken in chains \u2014 and when I say that \u2026 I don\u2019t mean it figuratively.\u201d\n\nWatch what Huckabee had to say here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The Founders Meant to Keep Government Out of the Church, Not God Out of the Government\n\nThe 4th of July makes us think of our independence and freedoms. And recent legal battles over religious liberty in the U.S.A. raise serious questions about the freedom to worship in America. So when our Founders came up with the First Amendment, were they trying to keep the government free from religion, or religion free from government?\n\nThese days, the phrase \"wall of separation between church and state\" has come to mean keeping God or His believers from having a big effect on government and public life. But that\u2019s far, far from what the Founding Fathers were thinking of when they were separating church and state.\n\nFear of an All-Powerful State Church Wed to the Power of the Government\n\nThey were afraid of what so many of the Old World countries had: a religion established by the state as its one true religion, that would tyrannically rule over the faith and conscience of every citizen.\n\nAs the Providence Forum\u2019s Peter Lillback put it, \u201cThey recognized having a monolithic church was a dangerous thing.\u201d That's because it made the king not only their physical sovereign but also their all-powerful spiritual ruler.\n\nBefore the Pilgrims fled England, Wallbuilders' David Barton recalled, \u201cThe Pilgrims\u2019 pastor was executed because he made the statement that Jesus Christ is head of the church. And the monarch said, \u2018oh no, I\u2019m the head of the church. You\u2019re dead.\u2019\u201d\n\nWouldn't Allow a Church of America Like the Brits Had the Church of England\n\nKnowing of such terror and tyranny, AmericanMinute.com historian William Federer explained how the Founders felt: \"Their big fear was the federal government was going to follow the blueprint of every country in Europe and pick one national denomination.\"\n\nSo what they meant by saying in the First Amendment \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" was that the federal government was banned from creating \u2013 or \"establishing\" \u2013 a national religion with the national government wedded to it.\n\n\"They didn't want to have a national, established Church of America like you have the Church of England, forcing people to believe something that they didn't believe in,\" said Jerry Newcombe, host of the radio program \"Vocal Point\".\n\n\u201cWhat they said was, 'We don't want a state church here. Consciously, therefore, they were separating the church from government,\" Lillback said.\n\nBut that was strictly to protect the churches and each believer\u2019s faith and conscience from the government.\n\nAll About Protecting Each American's Conscience and Freedom to Believe\n\nNot only did the First Amendment say, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" but it also said, \"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\n\"What they wanted was the freedom that we have in the Bible: the rights of conscience,\" Barton said. \"And they didn't want the state telling us how we could or couldn't practice our faith.\"\n\nLillback said the Founders keeping government control away from faith meant, \"Each of us has a right to be who we are before God. It has been well said and it's a classic statement of religious liberty that man is not free unless he is free on the inside. We have to have the freedom to believe what we believe. That's what the First Amendment protects.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n'God: He's on Both Sides of the Wall'\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Christian historian Eddie Hyatt explained Thomas Jefferson was talking about when he wrote the letter that first used the famous \"wall of separation\" phrase to a group of worried Baptists.\n\n\"He said that the First Amendment had erected a wall of separation that would protect them from any intrusion of the government,\" Hyatt stated. \"In Jefferson's mind, the wall of separation was a uni-directional wall, put there to keep the government out of the church; not to keep the influence of the church out of the government.\"\n\nThere was no antipathy towards the Lord in all of this, Lillback insisted, saying, \u201cBut the idea of God: He\u2019s on both sides of the wall. And He\u2019s welcome there. And He should be.\u201d\n\nThe Government Is Reaching Over that Wall, Bossing Around People of Faith\n\nBut today, there's been a complete flip.\n\nLillback said, \u201cThose who once believed in this really high and impregnable wall of church and state, we now see the government reaching over that wall and saying, \u2018but don\u2019t preach that text of scripture.\u2019\u201d\n\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE CBN NEWS APP\n\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Top Stories\n\nBarton added, \u201cAll of a sudden the government\u2019s regulating religious activities, which is what Jefferson said they would not do because of separation of church and state.\u201d\n\nHyatt lamented, \u201cThe Founders would be so distressed to see how that statement has been turned on its head.\u201d\n\nAs Newcombe explained, \"They absolutely did not mean the separation of God and government, which is what's often being practiced today.\"\n\nNo One 'Under Government,' but Each One 'Under God'\n\nLillback encourages Americans to remember what the nation's Founders intended.\n\n\u201cThis is a theistic government. So God was not separated from government,\" he insisted. \"So any interpretation of the First Amendment that takes God out of government is turning the whole story on its head. Rather it was taking a formal state church out of the equation, leaving it up to each individual. But all, as we still say, 'under God.' That was the view of our Founders.\"\n\nThey believed a nation based on liberty could only stay free if its citizens were godly people. As Barton pointed out, believers in God have their eyes on eternity, and it makes them practice self-control.\n\nKnowing You'll Answer to God Makes You Govern Yourself\n\n\"When you\u2019re God-conscious, you realize, \u2018ya know, I\u2019m going to have to answer to Him for what I do,\u2019 and it limits my bad behavior,\" Barton stated.\n\nNewcombe added, \u201cThat\u2019s something the Founders believed very strongly: that we\u2019re going to be accountable before God.\u201d\n\nHyatt said of those Founders, \"They knew that they were creating a nation for a free people, but also for a virtuous people who would govern themselves from within.\"\n\nYou need very little police power if people, because of conscience, will police themselves.\n\nGreen Bean Control Laws?\n\n\"Self-control is what you need,\" Barton explained. \"We can pass all the control laws we want. But unless you control the heart, you'll never control behavior. I mean, I can kill somebody with a can of green beans. What are we going to do? Pass green bean control laws if somebody does that? No. It's on the inside.\"\n\nAnd the Founders knew to keep America true and free, they also needed the perfect law of a loving, all-wise God.\n\nAs Lillback put it, \u201cThere was a clear understanding that the government needed to have an ultimate check and balance, even beyond the people that ran it and their elections. And that is the transcendent law of God. And so that is why when we look at our Declaration of Independence, there are four references to Deity.\u201d\n\nGoing through the Declaration, Lillback laid them out: \"'We're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' The laws of God and nature. And it tells us there's an appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world. And, finally, a dependence on the Providence of God. Four references to Deity.\"\n\nNot Godless at All\n\nBut then came the US Constitution, which some say is a godless document because God isn\u2019t mentioned in it. As soon as they were done with it, though, the Founders called for a day of Thanksgiving to God.\n\n\"They were not thinking 'let's get rid of God',\" Lillback stated. \"They said 'We have been given now a new Constitution, and now amendments that give us our freedoms. And where do we turn? We turn to heaven and thank God for this'.\"\n\n\"Now, if their intent was to get rid of God from government, boy did they miss their point,\" Lillback said. \"Because they turned around and thanked Him for everything that they had. It shows the utter historical absurdity of 'the godless Constitution'.\"\n\nConstitution's Last Words Reference Christ\n\nAnd God isn\u2019t really absent from the Constitution or its authors\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThey are not godless,\" Lillback insisted. \"They are people who at the very end of their work said \u2018In the year of our Lord, 1787.\u2019 The very last words in the Constitution are a reference to Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise then that the ultimate motto is We are One Nation Under God.\u201d\n\n*This story was originally published in July 2020.",

        "body": "Hurricane Beryl Roars Toward Jamaica after Killing at Least 6 People in Southeast Caribbean\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) - Hurricane Beryl was roaring toward Jamaica on Wednesday, with islanders scrambling to make preparations after the powerful Category 4 storm earlier killed at least six people and caused significant damage in the southeast Caribbean.\n\nIn Kingston, people boarded up windows, fishermen pulled their boats out of the water before sitting around a table to play dominoes beside a bay, and workers dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from the expected lashing winds to come.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan\u2019s east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. Early Wednesday, the storm was about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph), the center said.\n\nBeryl was expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica, where officials warned residents in flood-prone areas to prepare for evacuation.\n\n\u201cI am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat,\u201d Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a public address Tuesday. \u201cIt is, however, not a time to panic.\u201d\n\nIn Miami, U.S. National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said Jamaica appears to be in the direct path of Beryl. He urged residents to find a safe place to shelter and stay there through Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are most concerned about Jamaica, where we are expecting the core of a major hurricane to pass near or over the island,\u201d he said in an online briefing.\n\nStorm surge of 6-9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above typical tide levels are likely in Jamaica, as well as heavy rainfall.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in place for the entire southern coast of Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press. She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.\n\nGrenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \u201cremains a grim reality.\u201d\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed, and that \u201csimilar levels of devastation\u201d were expected on the islands of Myreau and Canouan.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nGrenada, known as the \u201cspice isle,\u201d is one of the world's top exporters of nutmeg. Mitchell noted that the bulk of the spices are grown in the northern part of the island, which was hit hardest by Beryl.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

        "body": "Recent events in the Middle East are causing additional hardship and suffering for Christians in Yemen.\n\nFor years, the tiny group of believers there have withstood intense persecution from militant Muslims and their government. Now, the attacks on ships and other actions of Houthi rebels are making matters worse.\n\nThe Houthi movement began about thirty years ago as an insurgency against the Sunni Muslim government. Armed by Iran, the Shia Muslim militia is crucial to Tehran's strategy to dominate the Middle East and control shipping lanes by restricting access to the Red Sea.\n\nREAD Houthi Strike Brings Death at Sea\n\nDuring recent testimony before Congress, former CIA intelligence analyst and Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute Dr. Kenneth Pollack said the Houthis share Iran's goal of destroying Israel and driving the United States and its allies out of the Middle East.\n\n\"The Houthis have proven themselves to be belligerent, aggressive, and convinced that violence is the best way to get what they want,\" Pollack insisted. \"They are forces of oppression inside Yemen and forces of aggression beyond it.\"\n\nYemen's small but growing community of Christians is among those targeted by the Houthis.\n\n\"The Christians in this area are folks that were formerly Muslim \u2013Muslim background believers that have converted to Christianity. Christians are obviously a despised, minority,\" explained Open Doors U.S. CEO Ryan Brown.\n\nBrown's group lists Yemen as the world's fifth worst persecutor of Christians on its 2024 World Watch list.\n\nHe said years of war had left the people largely dependent upon outside aid. So, when shipping lanes are disrupted, food and other necessities are slow to reach Middle Eastern ports, driving up costs, and Christians \u2013 those refusing to wage jihad or engage in Islamic practices are marginalized.\n\n\"Christians are often last in line as it relates to being able to receive the care and attention there as war and as these things continue to escalate. That has a ripple effect and economic ripple effect. It can disrupt supply chains, and so, while Christians were already last line, that line becomes even further elongated,\" explained Brown. \"And so Christians are very much impacted by what's going on currently.\"\n\nOnce they leave Islam and are baptized, Yemeni Christians are considered apostates by Muslims. So, they keep their new faith secret to avoid severe persecution and possibly death at the hands of their clan or family members.\n\nAnd if they are not killed for their faith, they are often blamed for their connections to the West.\n\n\"They become easy targets,\" said Brown. \"You know, there is Al-Qaeda presence in the South, Houthi presence in the North, and Christians are seen as enemies on all fronts there.\"\n\nBrown said although many Yemenis are frightened, they are also curious and asking questions about faith. Followers of Jesus respond with the Word of God.\n\nHe advises the body of Christ to pray for their Yemeni brothers and sisters in Christ, \"That even in the midst of this conflict, that they would see peace and they would see security, but they would recognize that in the midst of this conflict, God is doing incredible things, that his purposes are advancing, and the church is advancing there.\"",

        "body": "Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), responsible for Israel\u2019s forests, held a tree planting ceremony in memory of Druze soldiers who have given their lives in the current Iron Swords War.\n\n\"The Druze community's journey of mourning since the beginning of the war is a journey of mourning for the entire nation,\u201d Shaykh Mowafaq Tarif, the Spiritual Leader of the Druze Community in Israel said at the ceremony.\n\nYet, thanks to this journey, we can maintain normalcy in the country. KKL-JNF's initiative is a touching and significant gesture \u2013 planting trees in memory of the fallen here in the Galilee, where the roots of the Druze community have been planted for nearly a thousand years,\u201d Shaykh Tarif added.\n\nThere are about 143,000 Druze citizens living in northern Israel, including the Golan Heights. The men are all required to join the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), at about age 18, like Israeli Jewish men.\n\nNine Druze soldiers are among the more than 670 Israeli soldiers that have fallen in battle since the October 7th war, dubbed Iron Swords, began.\n\n\u201cThe Druze community has walked hand in hand with KKL-JNF for years. Our relationship is deeply rooted and important, covering a range of fields and topics,\u201d said KKL-JNF Chairwoman, Ifat Ovadia-Luski.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that today's tree-planting commemoration provides the bereaved families a place of solace, a piece of land that will grow and flourish. I believe that today's ceremony and our ongoing activities with the Druze community will continue to deepen our important connection,\u201d Ovadia-Luski said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the families planted olive trees in the KKL-JNF Ahihud Forest in northern Israel to honor their loved ones who fell while defending the country.\n\n\u201cOur sons sacrificed themselves for the security of the state. For us Druze, this is our country too, and it is our duty to protect and defend it,\u201d said Imad Habka father of Lieutenant Colonel Salman Habka from Yanuh-Jat village. Salman Habka was commander of the 53rd battalion in the Barak Brigade and fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cWe sacrificed our dearest loved ones, who left behind grieving families, parents, wives, and children. They deserve to be commemorated and remembered at every opportunity. KKL-JNF's dedication to their memory is deeply moving, and this way, everyone has a place to honor our sons,\u201d said Imad.\n\n\u201cThe planted trees will stand as living testimony to the bravery of the fallen and symbolize the partnership between Druze and Jews. KKL-JNF, as a national institution of the Jewish people, believes in and desires a partnership with the Druze community,\u201d said Shaykh Tarif.\n\n\u201cThe country is no longer the same as it was before but remains in the covenant between the Jewish people and the Druze community, a covenant created by exceptional individuals whom we remember today and will always remember,\u201d Shaykh Tarif added.\n\n\u201cI hope that this beautiful site will mark a new path in the relations between the community and the Jewish people, thanks to the fallen we commemorate and the shared belief that together we will strive for a better future,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to KKL-JNF, this planting underscores the preservation of their memory alongside KKL-JNF's \u201cvalues of growth and renewal.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the war, KKL-JNF held a tree planting event in memory of those murdered at the site of the Nova Music Festival. Relatives planted more than 300 trees there in honor of their loved ones who died on October 7th.\n\nOver the years, KKL-JNF has created various projects to strengthen ties with the Druze community. One of them is called the \"Paths of Sons\", which spans about 250 km (155 miles), connecting Druze villages on Mt. Carmel and in the Galilee, featuring 18 initial landmark stones.\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of participants join a race that follows the \u201cPaths of Sons.\u201d\n\nAnother project, \u201cCovenant of Brothers, Covenant of Life\u201d, which began in 2016, marks \u201cthe special bond between the Druze community and the State of Israel\u201d and takes place in the Ahihud Forest. Hundreds of youth march here each year to express \u201ccentral values of brotherhood, cooperation, and hope for a shared future,\u201d KKL-JNF says.",

From the beginning, we have said that we support Gaza,\u201d he told The Associated Press at the group\u2019s political office in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.\n\nExperts say a full-scale war would devastate Lebanon and cause major destruction inside Israel. Still, without a diplomatic solution or military campaign to drive Hezbollah back, it's unlikely Israeli citizens can return home.\n\nSheikh Insists Halt to Fighting in Gaza Would End Hezbollah Attacks\n\nSo the sheikh says if Israel wants the daily attacks from Hezbollah to stop, it needs to cease fighting Hamas in Gaza.\n\nOr as he said of the Gaza war, \u201cIf the next phase is a cease-fire, we will stop firing in Lebanon.\"\n\nBut Kassam adds if Israel insists on war with his terror group, it could well spin out of control. It might even drag in other nations, like Hezbollah's sponsor Iran.\n\n'No One Knows the Repercussions'\n\nThe sheikh explained, \u201cNo one knows the repercussions of igniting the war locally, regionally, or even internationally.\"\n\nIsraeli officials are trying to head off a war with Hezbollah. But if war does come, they warn Israel will repeat in Lebanon the kind of massive destruction it's already brought to Gaza.\n\nIran Represents an Even Greater Danger to Israel\n\nOn Tuesday, the commander of Iran's Aerospace Force declared his soldiers are eager to launch another aerial assault on Israel.\n\nThe first happened on April 13th when Iran launched close to 350 projectiles against the Jewish state. Israel and an allied force, including the U.S., France, the UK, and Jordan, shot down nearly 99 percent of those weapons.",

        "body": "It once was lost, but now it\u2019s found.\n\nThat\u2019s the story surrounding a Georgia man\u2019s beloved Bible, which had gone missing for months before the persistence of a good Samaritan changed everything.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nWilliam Bailey lost his Bible in January, when it fell off his car before he went to church one Wednesday. Bailey told The Courier Herald he had prepared a message to share at church that night and had it tucked inside his Bible before he set the book on his car for a moment.\n\n\u201cWe were getting ready to leave, and I sat [the Bible] on top of my car, and my granddaughter called and wanted me to come back inside the house for something,\u201d he told the outlet, explaining he forgot to grab the Bible and put it in the car before driving off. \u201cWe got to church, got out, and I thought I had forgotten my Bible.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he realized the book was gone. He and his wife, Dot, prayed for it to be found, but months went by, according to The Courier Herald.\n\nBailey said he was \u201csick\u201d over the loss and felt he would simply never find it again. Still, being selfless at his core, Bailey told his wife he hoped \u201cwhoever found it got some good out of it.\u201d\n\nLittle did he know, someone did find the Bible. A man named Barron Howard, Jr. discovered it in the family\u2019s driveway. And when his grandma, Barbara James, heard about the surprising find, she set out on a mission to locate its rightful owner.\n\n\u201cIf I lost my Bible, I would really want it back,\u201d she told The Courier Herald. \u201cI would hope that whoever found it would go the extra steps to find it and get it back to me. I just couldn\u2019t rest.\u201d\n\nJames truly didn\u2019t stop trying, but she wasn\u2019t getting anywhere; she couldn\u2019t find any information in the Bible that would lead her back to the mystery owner. James reportedly did find a number inside the Bible and phoned it twice a day \u2014 but no one answered.\n\nThat misfortune changed, though, when she noticed a zipper she had previously overlooked. Inside, she discovered a pamphlet for Faith Baptist Church. It was just the lead James had been desperately looking for. She called the pastor and found out about Bailey\u2019s search for the Bible.\n\nThen, the preacher told Bailey about James, and the two connected \u2014 a blessed miracle for Bailey, who was convinced his beloved Bible had been long obliterated by a lawn mower.\n\nJames recently brought the Bible to Dot, who works at a nursing home, and the families connected. Bailey is ecstatic, realizing not everyone would have gone to such lengths to get it back to its owner.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sentimental stuff to me,\u201d Bailey said of sermon notes and personal commentary inside the Bible. \u201cI thank the Lord that I got it back.\u201d\n\nJames is simply overjoyed she was able to help. Bailey gave her a financial gift for returning his beloved Bible.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "Want to Connect with Gen Z? Invite Them Over for Dinner",
        "body": "ANALYSIS\n\nGen Z is maturing within an unprecedented culture of media saturation. The entire world, via the internet, is available to them at all times on their smartphones.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not always a happy place, nor is it one that\u2019s particularly easy to make sense of. As such, their relationship with media, with themselves \u2014 and with other people \u2014 is complicated in a number of ways we are still realizing.\n\nBut what if I told you they, just like us, crave and seek out the advice and consolation of trusted people in their real lives when they\u2019re struggling? What if I told you that most prefer to connect face-to-face rather than through technology?\n\nYou might be surprised. After all, the mainstream depiction of Gen Z is often a teen endlessly scrolling on their phone, beset by depression and anxiety, falling slowly away from family and faith.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what they\u2019re like at all. According to recent data in The RELATE Project, the majority of Gen Z wants to talk to trusted parents, mentors, and friends when they\u2019re struggling. Gen Z is seeking connection and intentional relationships. They are surprisingly grounded, community-oriented, prayerful, and intentional as a demographic.\n\nThankfully, breaking down the walls between Gen Z and older generations seems to be something anyone and everyone can do, if they choose. The adolescents interviewed for The RELATE Project were quick to express a desire for authentic, no-fuss dinner-table conversations, recognizing that such an environment lends itself towards engaging in meaningful discussions about life and what\u2019s on their minds. Sharing life and authentic conversations\u2014where both sides listen\u2014also promotes relationship.\n\nThat means that any one of us can make a difference in the lives of Gen Z. Any one of us can open our homes to them, welcome them into our families, and invite them to share their lives, struggles, and joys at our side.\n\nSo invite them for dinner. Ask them to stay awhile. If we want them to flourish, we must unabashedly fling open the doors of our homes to the younger people in our midst, allowing them access to our dinner table, yes, but most importantly to our experiences, our lived wisdom, our relationship with God, our kindness, our time, and even our challenges.\n\nWhy? Because face-to-face interactions in an intimate, authentic setting can be the catalyst for a meaningful, long-term relationship of trust and respect. These relationships provide emerging adults with the tools \u2013 and the relationships \u2013 they need to thrive now and later on.\n\nOf course, feeding them isn\u2019t the only thing you need to do when they sit down at your table. The most important thing is to listen to them without judgment. They may not always want or even need our advice, but they do need us to actively listen \u2013 so be engaged and attentive. A simple \u201cTell me more,\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d or \u201cWhat else?\u201d shows that you are listening and creating space for those at your table to share with ease. Just as Kelly Corrigan advocates in her show Tell Me More, asking thoughtful questions leads to better connections and conversations.\n\nMy family made a practice of intentionally sharing our daily highs and lows at dinner. We found that, in doing so, we laid the groundwork for more complicated, personal, probing conversations \u2014 conversations that involved community concerns, faith, friendships, sorrows, and the future. These conversations were a tremendous gift to all of us, and I cherish the intimacy and authenticity we shared over those meals.\n\nThe kitchen table became a place to share the funny stories of our days, the struggles, and how we saw God showing up in our lives. I think our adult kids still feel safe to come to us now thanks in part to relationships built around the dinner table when they were young.\n\nBut this sense of safety, belonging, and trust shouldn\u2019t be limited to our own children or immediate family. It can be extended to every person whose lives we touch, though it may look very different from home to home or from person to person.\n\nYou can, for instance, become the available parent or grandparent, the house where all the kids hang out after school, and create a space of hospitality \u2013 where all are welcome. Because it\u2019s in those moments of carpooling, dishing out snacks, and opening your home after baseball or dance practice that opportunities arise to express that they are welcome, valued, and cared about \u2014 and that they belong.\n\nCarving out time to build authentic relationships with Gen Z matters. They\u2019ve told us they need us. They\u2019ve told us how they need us. So let\u2019s listen.\n\nDr. Kimberly Nollan is the director of research and evaluation at Young Life.",

        "title": "The Faith of Our Fathers: God and the American Revolution",
        "body": "CBN.com - Many people are unaware of America's Judeo-Christian heritage. The following are short profiles of some of America's founding fathers, sharing their thoughts on how God's hand could be seen in the establishment of this nation.\n\nJohn Adams\n\nIn June of 1776, John Adams was in Philadelphia, deep in the flurry of political activity. The Continental Congress appointed him, along with Thomas Jefferson and three others, to draft a \"Declaration of Independence\" from England. Although Adams was later to become the second president of the United States, he is best remembered for being one of the great minds and statesmen of the American Revolution. His prolific diaries, letters, and books provide an invaluable insight into the politics of the time and to what liberty meant to the founding fathers.\n\nFreedom, Adams believed, did not rest solely on man. Instead, he wrote, \"It is religion and morality alone, which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand ... the only foundation for a free constitution is pure virtues, and if this cannot be inspired into our people, in a greater measure, than they have it now, they may change their rulers, and the forms of government, but they will not obtain a lasting liberty\" (letter to cousin Zabdiel Adams, June 21, 1776).\n\nJohn Adams would face another difficult situation as the second president of the United States in 1798. He had a hard act to follow -- the popular George Washington. Although he tried to avoid the trap of partisan politics, Adams soon found himself caught in its web. And if trouble at home wasn't bad enough, diplomatic relations with France were rapidly sinking. Adams prepared the American army and navy for defensive measures against France.\n\nIt was during this time that Adams spoke to the first brigade of the militia of Massachusetts, and re-affirmed the foundations for the American government:\n\n\"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion,\" Adams said. \"Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nThomas Jefferson was just 33 years old when he was given the task of writing the Declaration of Independence. His knowledge of political philosophy, his eloquence as a writer, and his belief in natural rights made him a leader among the patriots.\n\nBut he was not without his political problems. Jefferson's opponents often portrayed him as an infidel and an atheist. But in reality, he was a staunch supporter of the freedom of religion and considered it a very personal matter -- one he often pondered in his writings. The man who gave us the immortal words \"when in the course of human events\" also gave us these reflections on God and his role in freedom. Etched in the marble of the Jefferson Memorial in his honor are these words:\n\n\"...God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever\" (from notes on the state of Virginia).\n\nIn the early 1780s, Jefferson was drafting a plan for future territories of the United States. Much of this plan became incorporated into the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which established guidelines for territories applying for statehood. Under this law, any new states added to the nation would be recognized as equals with the original 13 states and not as colonies. The ordinance's provisions for the states included self-government, religious tolerance and the prohibition of slavery.\n\nJefferson's belief in the unquestionable relationship between good government and religious freedom is reflected in article three of the Northwest Ordinance, where he writes:\n\n\"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\"\n\nNoah Webster\n\nNoah Webster's dictionaries, spellers, and grammars shaped the education of America in the 18th century and his legacy still lives on today. As the author of the first American dictionary and a son of the American Revolution, Webster sought to give the new country a different kind of freedom -- a culture of its own. Webster considered his most important project his revision of the King James Bible. He wanted to make it accessible to every American. He believed God played an important part in the education of the people and in the preservation of the American experiment.\n\nHere is his advice on how to choose the nation's leaders:\n\n\"When you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers, let it be impressed on your mind that God commands you to choose for rulers, just men who will rule in the fear of God. The preservation of a republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty; if the citizens neglect their duty, and place unprincipled men in office, the government will soon be corrupted\" (\"Advice to the Young\" from Value of the Bible and Excellence of the Christian Religion, 1834).\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nBenjamin Franklin's role in drafting the Declaration of Independence was far from his first invention. This founding father contributed to America both in politics and in science. From almanacs and kite flying to serving as ambassador and statesman, Benjamin Franklin was truly one of the most versatile of America's founding fathers. Franklin's scientific mind also led to many intellectual and philosophical discussions.\n\nAlthough he was not a regular church-goer in his adult life, he expressed the importance of implementing God's moral values in all aspects of life. His writings demonstrate an acknowledgment of God that transcended the scientific mysteries Franklin longed to answer. In 1731 he articulated a creed to live by, both personally and in public life:\n\n\"That there is one God, Father of the universe. That He is infinitely good, powerful, and wise. That He is omnipresent. That He ought to be worshipped, by adoration prayer and thanksgiving both in public and private.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1787, delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia had been in bitter debate for ten long weeks. Tempers flared over heated issues between the northern and southern states. As tensions rose, some delegates threatened to pull out of the convention altogether, leaving the fledgling nation without a strong constitution.\n\nWhen it looked like no one would ever be able to agree, the elder statesman of the group took charge. The 81-year-old Franklin stood to his feet. And although he was not known to be devoutly religious, he gave this contentious gathering a stirring call for prayer.\n\n\"I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? ... I also believe that without His concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better, than the builders of Babel \u2026 Therefore, I beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning...\"\n\nBenjamin Rush\n\nBenjamin Rush's impact on America did not stop with his signature on the Declaration of Independence. Although he was a member of the Continental Congress, Rush was also one of the most influential physicians in early America. He served as the Continental Army's Surgeon General during the American Revolution.\n\nUnder President John Adams, Rush was Treasurer of the United States Mint. More notably, the statesman encouraged support for building more African churches in Philadelphia. Rush was convinced this would reduce high black prison populations since many of the convicted served time for stealing food and clothing.\n\nBenjamin Rush's advocacy reflected earlier writings of his beliefs in a strong religious and moral foundation for all people. In 1806 he wrote:\n\n\"The only foundation for a useful education in a republic is to be laid in religion. Without this, there can be no virtue, and without virtue, there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.\"\n\nWilliam Penn\n\nLittle did William Penn know that his vision of establishing a society that was godly, virtuous and exemplary for all would one day birth the freedoms of a nation. After establishing Pennsylvania with land granted by King Charles the second, Penn set out to plan a city called Philadelphia. Years later William Penn's historic city would become the first capital of the United States and out of it the nation's foundational structure would be laid.\n\nAlthough Penn is best remembered for his vision of a democratic government and peaceful co-existence with the native Indians, in 1682, William Penn's beliefs of government fundamentals echo those of biblical principles:\n\n\"It is impossible, Penn wrote, that any people of government should ever prosper, where men render not unto God, that which is God's, as well as to Caesar, that which is Caesar's.\"\n\nJames Wilson\n\nOne of the lesser-known patriots and founding fathers of our nation was Scottish-born James Wilson. The young lawyer's writings on the British Parliament's authority impressed members of the Continental Congress so much they elected him to the body in 1775. The following year, Wilson signed the Declaration of Independence and later the United States Constitution.\n\nServing as a United States Supreme Court Justice until his death, James Wilson realized there was a much higher law than man's to consider. When questioning what the ultimate cause of moral obligation is, Wilson determined, \"I give it this answer, the will of God. This is the supreme law. His just and full right of imposing laws, and our duty in obeying them, are the sources of our moral obligations.\"\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nIn May of 1776, fighting was well underway in the American Revolution. For General George Washington it was a stressful time. Under his command in New York, he had about 7 thousand men. The rag-tag army was poorly trained. They were about to face some thirty thousand soldiers from the most highly trained and successful military force in the world. The Americans were outnumbered and outgunned. As they waited in New York for the onslaught of British military power, Washington issued orders for his troops to pray for the campaign ahead.\n\nOn May 17, 1776, he wrote that that day was, \"...to be observed as a day of fasting humiliation and prayer, humbly to supplicate the mercy of almighty God, that it would please Him to pardon all our manifold sins and transgressions, and to prosper the arms of the united colonies, and finally establish the peace and freedom of America upon a solid and lasting foundation.\"\n\nAfter the Revolution, Washington was elected America's first president. Years later, as he prepared to leave office and return to his beloved Mount Vernon, foremost in his mind was the need for the young nation to stay neutral on foreign issues until it grew stronger. George Washington chose to send this message to the nation in a farewell address -- not in a speech, but in the September 1796 Philadelphia newspapers. In it, the president advised Americans to value the newly formed republic and its constitution. But Washington cautioned that the country's success depended not only on national strength but also on two essential factors:\n\n\"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion, and morality are indispensable supports.\"\n\n*This history-based article was first published before 2012",

        "title": "'We're the Frontline': CBN News Joins Border Sheriff to Show You the Threat to America",
        "body": "SOUTHERN ARIZONA - In the scorching desert of Arizona, one local sheriff is waging war against cartels, human smugglers, and the drugs all crossing the border. CBN News visited the area with him to witness the crisis firsthand.\n\nIt might be 70 miles north of the Mexico-Arizona border, but Pinal County feels like the front lines of the fentanyl crisis. For years, cartels have used this route to smuggle illicit cargo north across the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation. Since 2017, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb has worked to stop it.\n\nSheriff Lamb told us, \"The reservation starts and then that reservation goes all the way into Mexico. It crosses over the border. So on both sides, you have Mexico and the United States. But the reservation is on both sides. And so they'll push through the reservation. And a lot of times members of that reservation will drive them up to the county line and drop them off.\"\n\n\"And then what they do is they hike up to the I-8 or just on the other side to a place like where I'm going to show you now and then they'll load out their vehicle and take off.\"\n\n\"And these are what you would call the 'Gotaways' or the people that get into the country undetected,\" he said.\n\nCBN News rode along with Sheriff Lamb to see the scale of the problem.\n\n\"So mind you, I could probably show you 100 of these spots,\" he explained.\n\n\"And you see all the residue from the people here, the water jugs, the clothes, the blankets, the camouflage,\" he said. \"That orange twine is the remnants of marijuana. They use the burlap straps to put them to make a backpack. And then they'll use the twine to tie these two packs together.\"\n\nThis vast desert poses a major challenge for Lamb and his deputies to police it all.\n\n\"This is a unique area. We actually have rip crews that will come in these areas and the rip crews are other drug dealers, other criminals that will come and steal the product from these loads whether it's marijuana, the fentanyl, the pills. But lately what they've been stealing and which has more value is humans. So if they're trafficking a load of ten people that are trying to come to America, the rip crews can come and steal them and then go up and extort them for money, put them into the sex trade, make them work for them, do all that,\" he explained.\n\nWATCH OUR EXCLUSIVE REPORT from Arizona BELOW:\n\nThe result is measured in human suffering.\n\n\"These poor people, when we find them, they're darn near dead, just from exhaustion, from what the cartels put them through,\" Sheriff Lamb said.\n\nCBN News traveled to the edge of the Indian reservation, the Tohono O'odham Reservation that goes all the way down across the U.S.-Mexican border. There were piles of clothing everywhere at a drop-off point we observed. But these are not migrants. These are not people who are coming across looking for asylum.\n\nWe know this because the pile includes shoes made of carpet which masks footprints and the sound of walking. We discovered camouflage hats and jackets out here too. These are uniforms with the same hats, obviously purchased at the same place. It's the same kind of camouflage.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nThere were several of these camouflage backpacks also out here. This is what you would expect from a military invasion when people are wearing uniforms that are standardized. These are obviously being funded by the cartels. And instead of carrying weapons, what they're carrying into America is poison.\n\nLamb said, \"We're the frontline. And frankly, they're far more equipped if they decided to actually come over with guns and all their equipment. ...How much military weaponry can you buy with $13 billion a year? They are amassing armies, well, well-equipped armies in Mexico that are going to be very difficult to deal with.\"\n\nSheriff Lamb believes the problem is as much the fault of the U.S. government as it is of the cartels. That's why this sheriff has decided to run for U.S. Senate in 2024.\n\nLamb said, \"This fight, the only way to get rid of these people is to vote them out or to impeach him. And so there is hope. The hope is that every two years we have elections. And this next election is a crucial election because if you don't like this stuff if you don't want these people flowing into America, we've got to get somebody back in there that believes in border security that's actually going to do it, and protect our communities and frankly, protect these people that are being taken advantage of by the cartels.\"",

        "body": "With the 2024 election heating up, attention is turning to official party positions and platforms.\n\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of groups announced the launch of the Platform Integrity Project, an effort to ensure the Republican Party Platform maintains its conservative ideals.\n\nFamily Research Council Action (FRC Action), a group that seeks to influence politicians on behalf of faith and family issues, notes the new effort aims to protect the \u201cpro-life, pro-family, and pro-Israel\u201d elements of the Republican Party platform.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nFRC Action Chairman Tony Perkins is an elected member of the Republican National Committee (RNC) Platform Committee and is at the helm of the Platform Integrity Project.\n\n\"For the first time ever, we will actually be scoring votes on the party platform. And so when there are key votes that pertain to life, marriage, human sexuality, religious freedom, those core values that you know we talk about making America great again. Well, America can't be great until it's morally good. It has to have that foundation,\" he told CBN News.\n\nHe also explained the scope of the Platform Integrity Project in a statement shared with us.\n\n\u201cThis coalition seeks to work with the RNC and the Trump campaign for an open process that will help ensure the preservation of the GOP\u2019s solidly conservative platform that contains longstanding pro-life, pro-family, and pro-Israel planks,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis effort will, for the first time, score individual votes of platform delegates.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Tony Perkins Announces Major Effort to 'Protect' New GOP Platform\n\nThe announcement comes amid concerns moderate Republicans could try to dilute the more conservative planks of the platform.\n\nPerkins said party platforms are incredibly important as they highlight a party\u2019s priorities and principles, with past data suggesting lawmakers tend to stick closely to the ideals in their associated platforms.\n\nHe added that FRC Action is teaming up with other groups like WallBuilders, Faith Wins, Family Policy Alliance, and Palmetto Family Council, among others, to launch the Platform Integrity Project and ensure clear and concise ideals are communicated about \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica is an unprecedented place of moral and cultural confusion and is in dire need of leadership and moral clarity,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cVoters need to see a contrast between the two parties on their policy priorities. Voters want and need a choice.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe message to Platform Committee delegates is clear: preserve life and family values in the Republican Party platform so that social conservatives can continue to find a home in the GOP.\u201d\n\nThe Platform Integrity Project comes amid fears the Republican Party and Trump campaign could end up watering down or removing some of the more conservative ideals in the GOP platform.\n\nThis is particularly pronounced in the wake of the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and returned abortion laws to the states. This will be the first party platform that must contend with the new realities surrounding the Supreme Court\u2019s monumental move.\n\nCBN's Chief Political Analyst David Brody warns the GOP could be playing with fire if it backs down from its pro-life stance.\n\n\"If the GOP starts to tinker around with the platform and I mean the Trump campaign specifically, that could give some evangelical voters who are on the fence pause to go with Trump a second time around and that could be a key difference because enthusiasm is everything and the last thing the Trump campaign needs right now is to have everybody not on board and to give the media and the Democrats some sort of controversy if you will, to capitalize on,\" Brody said.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nPerkins\u2019 campaign is imploring people to sign up and encourage delegates and officials who will be meeting July 8-9 to draft the new GOP Party Platform to stand by traditional party values.\n\n\u201cMay God give them wisdom and discernment as they meet, evaluate important ideas, and vote on policies,\u201d text on the Platform Integrity Project website reads. \u201cMay they have great understanding and clarity as they address the critical and sometimes complex issues facing our nation.\u201d\n\nFind out more about the Platform Integrity Project.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

He had also texted his pastor that he had been surrounded by Muslims.\n\nThe group\u2019s anger might have been sparked by the evangelist\u2019s success in the Butebo District, where he preached door-to-door, to convert Muslims to Christianity.\n\nThe pastor he texted detailed some of this to Morning Star News.\n\n\u201cThe evening of June 17, I received a short message from Malinga of being surrounded by the Muslims,\u201d the preacher said. \u201cI wrote back to him several times, but there was no response.\u201d\n\nThe local resident who found Malinga\u2019s body reportedly found his phone and called the pastor, who then informed the police about the murder.\n\nAuthorities are reportedly investigating the killing as friends and loved ones mourn.\n\n\u201cWe as a church are very saddened for losing our active, devoted, and committed evangelist who won many people, including Muslims, to Christianity,\u201d the preacher said.\n\nAccording to Voice of the Martyrs, Uganda is a majority Christian nation, but Islamic extremism is still at work within its borders. This has led to discrimination, persecution, and other chaos. These issues are particularly problematic for Muslims who convert to Christianity.\n\n\u201cRadical Islam\u2019s influence has grown steadily, and many Christians within the majority Muslim border regions are facing severe persecution, especially those who convert from Islam,\u201d the persecution watchdog notes. \u201cDespite the risks, many churches in Uganda have responded by reaching out to their neighbors; many churches are training leaders how to share the Gospel with Muslims and care for those who are persecuted after they become Christians.\u201d\n\nAs CBN News previously reported, Twaha Namwoyo, 38, and Nadiimu Katooko, 27, were a husband and wife and the parents of four children in the Ugandan village of Bulalaka. They were killed earlier this year just two months after converting to Christianity.

        "body": "Reactions to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling granting limited immunity to occupants of the Oval Office came swift and strong.\n\nPresident Biden condemned it as a \"dangerous precedent.\"\n\nFormer President Trump called it a \"big win for the Constitution.\"\n\nIn addition to its historical impact, the ruling also affects an election interference case against Trump.\n\nFor the first time in its 235-year history, the court clarified the issue of presidential immunity, ruling 6-3 that presidents have absolute immunity for official acts and presumptive immunity for official actions taken outside the parameter of the explicit duties of the office.\n\nPresident Trump brought the case to the high court, contending he had absolute immunity from criminal charges based on his official acts as president on January 6, 2021.\n\n\"You're not going to do anything (as president) if you don't have immunity because otherwise, you're going to be prosecuted after you leave office,\" he said.\n\nA majority of the justices agreed.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts delivered the court's opinion: \"The nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.\"\n\n\"The court, in a rather complicated way, carved out various levels of immunity that a president might enjoy,\" said Claire Wofford, Associate Professor of Political Science at the College of Charleston.\n\nImmediately after the ruling was announced, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Big win for our Constitution and democracy. Proud to be an American!\"\n\nIn an address to the nation on Monday night, President Biden claimed the ruling means there are no limits on what a president can do.\n\n\"This is a fundamentally new principle and it's a dangerous precedent,\" he said. \"Because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even by the Supreme Court of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.\"\n\nThe ruling kicks the January 6th case down to the U.S. federal District Court and it puts the burden on Special Prosecutor Jack Smith to prove the former president acted unofficially and with criminal motivation as a candidate for president.\n\nThat will be hard to prove because the Supreme Court said his contacts with the Department of Justice and Vice President Pence to overturn the election took place as official acts within the president's authority.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nWhen Trump's lawyers presented arguments before the court last April, Justice Sonya Sotomayor asked if there should be any limits on presidential actions. \"If the president decides his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military or orders someone else to assassinate him, is that within his official acts for which he can get immunity?\"\n\nJustices Kagan and Jackson agreed with Sotomayor voting against the majority's decision.\n\nIn the dissent, Sotomayor wrote: \"Today's decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law...the court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more.\"\n\nLegal experts agree this unprecedented, historic ruling will have far-reaching implications not only for Donald Trump but for future presidents as well.\n\n\n\nIt also means Jack Smith's January 6th case against the former president will likely be delayed until after the November election.\n\nAnd President Trump is now citing the ruling in an attempt to overturn his conviction in New York last month, despite those acts being committed before he was president.\n\nWATCH Our LIVE Analysis: Supreme Court Decision on Presidential Immunity",

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argues that the Israeli Defense Forces are destroying Hamas' ability to strike as an army. But many of the terrorists have escaped, and he acknowledges the IDF will have to keep chasing them down all over Gaza.\n\nAs Netanyahu puts it, \u201cWe are nearing the end of the elimination phase of Hamas\u2019s terrorist army. There will be a continuation of hitting its remnants.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu added he expects to achieve the war's goals, \u201cTo return our hostages, to eliminate the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, to ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat, and even more than that to return our residents both in the south and in the north safely to their homes.\u201d\n\nHad to Evacuate Six Times\n\nThe IDF has destroyed much of Khan Younis, a huge suburb of Rafah, in earlier pitched battles to wipe Hamas out there. But many of the surviving terrorists have recently fled from Rafah to Khan Younis. So the IDF is having to order the civilians there -- many who are already evacuees from other areas \u2013 to evacuate once again so they don't get mowed down in the renewed fighting.\n\nOne bedraggled and angry woman said as she fled with her family, \"Here we are going to look for a place to evacuate to. I've been displaced six times from Rafah.\"\n\nIt appears the Biden administration continues to demand how the Israelis should conduct this war. With so much of Gaza bombed and in ruins, it's thought many Palestinians living there might well be better off moving elsewhere. But the U.S. is telling Israel it must eventually let all Gazans settle back permanently in Gaza.\n\n\n\nAs State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel stated, \"There can be no permanent displacement of Gazans.\"\n\nWhat the Biden Administration Finds Unacceptable\n\nAnd the Biden administration is saying the Israelis must make sure after the war there is an Arab-led civilian government set up in Gaza. Some in the Jewish nation think it can't really be safe from Gaza unless there's some form of Israeli occupation to make sure terrorists can't rise to power again there.\n\nBut U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken insists anything less than Arabs back in charge is one of three things unacceptable to the Biden administration.\n\nHe states, \"We know that there are three things that are unacceptable for Gaza's future. An Israeli occupation, Hamas perpetuating its leadership, or chaos, anarchy, lawlessness - which is what we're seeing in big parts of Gaza today.\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time Blinken is dictating to Israel what is or is not acceptable, he also has harsh words for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his refusal to say \"yes\" to a ceasefire that could bring hostages home and end the violent war.\n\nBlinken explained, \"Right now, in not saying yes, Mr. Sinwar is not only holding on to the Israeli, American and other hostages, he's continuing to make a hostage of Palestinian children, women, and men, who are caught in a horrific crossfire of Hamas' making.\"\n\nWar Between Israel and Hezbollah\n\nBlinken also addressed the possibility of war between Israel and Hezbollah saying, \u201cOn the one hand, no one wants a war. On the other hand, you have forces, momentum that may be leading in that direction, in which we are determined to try to arrest.\n\nBlinken noted about the thousands of Israeli evacuees, \"You have 60,000 or so Israelis out of their homes in northern Israel. Israel has essentially lost sovereignty in that part of the country because people don\u2019t feel safe going to their homes.\u201d\n\nSuing Iran, Syria & North Korea for $4,000,000,000\n\nVictims who survived Hamas' brutal assault on Israel on October 7th are suing Iran, Syria, and North Korea for four billion dollars. They accuse those countries of giving Hamas the money, weapons, and other assistance that made the deadly October 7th attack possible.\n\nAnti-Defamation League Director Jonathan Greenblatt announced the legal action, \u201cThis lawsuit on behalf of more than a hundred Americans who are affected by this attack will indeed ensure that there are consequences to be brought for the bloodiest day experienced by the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nOn another front, Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly rejected the Palestinian Authority having a role in ruling Gaza after the war. Many Israelis feel the PA \u2013 just like Hamas \u2013 wants to see the Jewish nation destroyed and is fomenting that in Judea and Samaria, the so-called West Bank. But it appears Netanyahu may be softening a bit and ready to let lower-level PA workers take part in governing Gaza. Yet that would be only as long as they've been thoroughly vetted by Israel first.\n\nRescued Daughter at Mother's Side\n\nIn sad news, Liora Argamani, the mother of Noa Argamani, passed away. Liora suffered from terminal brain cancer and had hoped to see her daughter Noa before she died. Hamas terrorists kidnapped Noa from the Nova Music Festival, and she spent eight months in captivity before being rescued by IDF special forces in a daring raid last month. The rescue allowed Noa to be with her mother during Liora's last days.",

        "title": "Ray Comfort's Surprising Reaction to ACLU's Ten Commandments Lawsuit",
        "body": "Preacher Ray Comfort is praising an unlikely party: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\nComfort, known for his viral videos and engaging Gospel-sharing, recently sent a gift basket to the civil rights group after the organization sued Lousiana over its decision to become the first U.S. state to mandate the Ten Commandments be displayed in public school classrooms.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nRather than deride the ACLU, Comfort offered a \u201cthank you\u201d for giving massive and renewed cultural attention to the famed biblical commandments.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU, in wanting to sue the state of Louisiana, have done us a great favor,\u201d he told CBN News. \u201cTheir lawsuit was big news in the secular media, and so the Ten Commandments have featured from Newsweek to Time magazine, USA Today, to The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, Fox, on huge podcasts, \u2018The View,\u2019 all throughout social media, and comedian Jimmy Kimmel even quoted all of the Ten Commandments to his massive viewing audience. You can\u2019t buy that sort of publicity!\u201d\n\nConsidering this inadvertent \u201cgift,\u201d Comfort decided to send the ACLU a large basket filled with chocolate and a thank-you card.\n\nThat card included a message that read, \u201cThank you for publicizing The Ten Commandments. America needs to be reminded of God\u2019s Law, and you\u2019ve certainly done that. Very grateful.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU reportedly hasn\u2019t responded to the gesture and note, but Comfort said he doesn\u2019t expect the organization to do so. Comfort has long advocated for Christians \u2014 and humans more generally \u2014 to pay attention to the Ten Commandments and implement these moral truths into their lives.\n\nHe told CBN News that Americans today can learn a great deal by studying biblical Israel and understanding its timeless parallels to our current situation.\n\n\u201cAmerica is no different than Israel in the Old Testament who forgot the Ten Commandments, and consequently gave themselves to sin,\u201d Comfort said. \u201cAnd the reason they did so was because of the sin of \u2018idolatry.'\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhen we forsake the Law that forbids making up false gods and committing adultery, we tend to make up our own congenial image of God and run headlong into sexual sin. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to the United States.\u201d\n\nComfort believes the only catalyst for awakening Americans to their national sin is a \u201cfresh look at the Ten Commandments.\u201d In fact, Comfort\u2019s ministry, Living Waters, has spent four decades teaching Christians about the importance of the Ten Commandments and equipping them to share the Gospel.\n\nComfort said he would love to see every school in the U.S. display the Ten Commandments, but noted he believes too many people are \u201cbrainwashed into believing in the fallacy of \u2018separation of church and state.'\u201d\n\nAs CBN News previously reported, the ACLU is suing after Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed H.B. 71 into law, meaning every classroom from kindergarten to the university level, which receives state funding, would be required to display the commandments \u201con a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches.\u201d\n\nThe effort, slated to be privately funded, will require a poster-sized display accompanied by a four-paragraph explanation offering context. The text will note that the Ten Commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\u201d\n\nThese classroom posters are due to be posted by the start of 2025.\n\nThe ACLU, its Lousiana branch, the atheist-led Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and nine Lousiana families joined forces to challenge the law. CBN News will continue to cover the case as it unfolds.\n\nMost recently, Living Waters released the \u201cTrump/Biden Million Dollar Bill,\u201d a free tract leading up to the U.S. election in November. It can be ordered here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Is This a Climate Emergency? These Horrific Weather Events from Long Ago Tell the True Story\n\nThe phrase \"extreme heat\" is being used over and over in news coverage as if to signal that a climate emergency has arrived.\n\nWe're told 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record, while two-thirds of Americans in a PBS/Marist Poll now say climate change is affecting the weather.\n\nDenver resident Mike Barela said, \"People are starting to realize that there is an effect.\" Miami resident Stephen Escudero said, \"This definitely feels like we're in that point of no return that people have talked about for a long time.\"\n\nSome have called on President Biden to declare a 'climate emergency' amid searing summer temperatures. And UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called for immediate action on climate change, saying, \"The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.\"\n\nWeather history, however, tells a different story \u2013 that the worst weather events, including the hottest years, have all been in the past.\n\n\n\nThe worst hurricane in history? The Great Hurricane of 1780, which killed over 20,000 people in the Caribbean.\n\n\n\nThe worst wildfire in U.S. history? The Peshtigo Fire in Wisconsin in 1871 killed at least 1,500 people and burned over a million acres.\n\nThe worst flood in world history was in 1931 \u2013 the Yangtze River Flood in China, which killed almost 4 million people.\n\nThe worst flood in U.S. history was in 1889, in Johnston, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nThe deadliest tornado in recorded U.S. history was in 1925. The Tri-State Tornado, which struck Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, killing some 700 people.\n\nAnd the hottest year was not 2023, but 1936. In 1936, 21 states had their all-time temperature records.\n\n\n\nSteve Milloy of Junkscience.com said, \"We know in the United States that the 1930s were extremely hot \u2013 1936 is the hottest year on record in the United States and probably throughout the northern Hemisphere.\"\n\nSome northern cities saw temperatures between 115 and 120 degrees that year. Many thousands died across the country and the resulting Dust Bowl forced the migration of 3 and half million climate refugees out of the Great Plains and Midwest.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Earth has been warming incrementally since an extremely cold period known as Little Ice Age ended in 1850.\n\n\n\nBut Weatherbell Chief Forecaster Joe Bastardi blames this summer's sweltering temperatures on a huge amount of water vapor created by an immense underwater volcanic eruption in Tonga last year that was 1,000 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and by warming oceans.\n\nBastardi told us, \"There's been an increase in what we call geothermal spreading since the early 1990s. And what it does is it develops a cumulative buildup of heat in the oceans, which then has to be released through the El Ninos, which then puts all sort of water vapor in the air, which then leads to the warming that you're seeing. It's all water vapor.\"\n\n\n\nThere have also been record-breaking cold temperatures this summer, but that weather news is ignored.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis reminded reporters Sunday that while Hurricane Idalia was very damaging, it paled in comparison to the Category 5 Labor Day storm of 1935, which had peak winds of 200 miles per hour and killed more than 400 people.\n\n\u201cThere were people that got caught up in the storm that their clothes got ripped off their bodies, that the wind was so strong. So I think that the notion that somehow, hurricanes are something new that's just false and, and we've got to stop politicizing the weather and stop politicizing natural disasters,\" DeSantis said at a post-hurricane press conference.\n\nMilloy says, \"It's a very complicated issue that the alarmists just like want to boil down to 'fossil fuel use is destroying the planet.' The whole climate is a lot more complicated.\n\nSummers in the U.S. are supposed to be hot, something even the Babylon Bee noticed: Global Warming Mysteriously Spikes Every Year Between June And August, Experts Say\n\n* The video in this story first aired in 2023",

We received a preliminary injunction on behalf of Child Evangelism Fellowship of Hawaii and its Good News Clubs for after school Bible clubs to be given equal access as similarly situated clubs on public school campuses across Hawaii. See morehttps://t.co/pGXN8hhXK8 \u2014 Liberty Counsel (@libertycounsel) June 28, 2024\n\nCBN News reported previously that CEF Hawaii had submitted applications to host Good News Clubs in several schools, including Nu'uanu Elementary, Lincoln Elementary, Waimea Elementary, Kalihi Waena Elementary, Kohala Elementary School, and Pearl City Elementary. All submissions were continually denied by the state's Department of Education (DOE).\n\n\n\nWhile the Hawaii DOE argued that the prohibition of these clubs was based on \"misappropriation of school policies,\" CEF argued that their decision reflected \"blatant religious discrimination.\"\n\n\n\nIn a reply brief filed back in April, the legal organization explained that the department chose \"silence\" over correcting \"unequal and unconstitutional treatment\" by its own officials.\n\n\n\nThe awarded preliminary injunction serves as a big win for religious freedom within schools in Hawaii.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This is a great victory for Child Evangelism Fellowship, parents, and the students in Hawaii public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public schools cannot discriminate against Christian viewpoints regarding use of school facilities. Child Evangelism Fellowship gives children a safe space that offers moral and character development from a Christian viewpoint. Good News Clubs should be in every public elementary school.\"\n\nGood News Clubs, which meet weekly, are led by community volunteers.

        "body": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - A dangerous and extremely powerful Hurricane Beryl made landfall Monday on the Caribbean island of Carriacou after becoming the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.\n\nWinds up to 150 mph (240 kph), just shy of a Category 5 storm, blew off roofs, uprooted trees and caused other damage on Carriacou, one of the islands of Grenada, and elsewhere in the southeast Caribbean.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nHurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados, Grenada, Tobago and St. Vincent and the Grenadines as thousands of people hunkered down in homes and shelters. The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nNBC Radio in St. Vincent and the Grenadines said it received reports of roofs being torn off churches and schools as communications began collapsing across the southeast Caribbean.\n\nIn nearby Grenada, officials received \u201creports of devastation\u201d from Carriacou and surrounding islands, said Terence Walters, Grenada\u2019s national disaster coordinator. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said he would travel to Carriacou as soon as it\u2019s safe, noting that there\u2019s been an \u201cextensive\u201d storm surge.\n\nGrenada officials had to evacuate patients to a lower floor after hospital roof was damaged, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is the likelihood of even greater damage,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe have no choice but to continue to pray.\u201d\n\nLater on Monday morning, Beryl was about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the island of Grenada, moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph).\n\nIn Barbados, officials received more than a dozen reports of roof damage, fallen trees and downed electric posts across the island, said Kerry Hinds, emergency management director. Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information, said drones - which are faster than crews fanning across the island - would assess damage once Beryl passes.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in effect for St. Lucia, Martinique and Trinidad. A tropical storm watch was issued for Haiti\u2019s entire southern coast, and from Punta Palenque in the Dominican Republic west to the border with Haiti. A hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica.\n\nForecasters warned of a life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl made landfall, with 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands and possibly 10 inches in some areas (25 centimeters), especially in Grenada and the Grenadines.\n\nThe storm was expected to weaken slightly over the Caribbean Sea on a path that would take it just south of Jamaica and later toward Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 1.\n\n\u201cBeryl is forecast to remain a significant hurricane during its entire trek across the Caribbean region,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nOfficials in some southeast Caribbean islands announced controlled power outages and warned of water cuts ahead of the storm, as well as landslides and flash floods. Schools, airports and government offices shuttered.\n\nBeryl strengthened from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours - a feat accomplished only six other times in Atlantic hurricane history, and with Sept. 1 as the earliest date, according to hurricane expert Sam Lillo.\n\nIt also was the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, besting Hurricane Dennis, which became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous hurricane for the Windward Islands,\" said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry. Beryl amassed its strength from record warm waters that are hotter now than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September, he said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in northeast Mexico and killed four people.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "summary": "The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\u201cBeryl is forecast to remain a significant hurricane during its entire trek across the Caribbean region,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said.\nIt also was the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, besting Hurricane Dennis, which became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\nBeryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.",

        "title": "Rishi Sunak awaits multimillion-dollar payday after losing $177,000 PM gig",
        "body": "It\u2019s official. Rishi Sunak is no longer the U.K. Prime Minister. His long and winding road to the Number 10 exit door has felt inevitable since he took over from the economically disastrous, short-lived Liz Truss government in the autumn of 2022.\n\nBut 44-year-old Sunak\u2014reportedly found riding off into the Californian sunset on his Peloton before results landed\u2014is more likely to be licking his lips at the future that awaits him than stewing over what could have been with another five years in office.\n\nThat\u2019s because Sunak, a man who is technically richer than the King of England and has a past as a high-flying London banker, can prepare for a few more lucrative perks as he steps away from a life of service.\n\nSunak\u2019s millions\n\nAs prime minister, Sunak was entitled to a salary of \u00a380,000, in addition to his \u00a391,346 salary as a member of parliament for his Richmond and Northallerton constituency. Tax records show that last year, he took home \u00a3139,000 ($177,000) from those roles.\n\nHis pay packet for leading the U.K. is a meager sum compared to what he got used to before entering politics and even his other forms of income while he held the job. Sunak made nearly \u00a31.8 million in capital gains last year and paid a total of \u00a3500,000 in tax.\n\nSunak worked as a successful banker for years, starting at Goldman Sachs before achieving an MBA and returning to the lucrative hedge fund space.\n\nAccording to an analysis by efinancialcareers, Sunak probably only earned less than \u00a3100,000 in his first three years out of university.\n\nWhile working at the hedge fund TCI between 2006 and 2009 in his mid-20s, Sunak became a multimillionaire after he and his colleagues shared a \u00a3100 million pot after a lucrative bet in the buildup to the global financial crisis.\n\nThe hedge fund took an activist position in the Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, forcing its sale to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which resulted in a \u00a3555.9 million profit. However, that acquisition saddled the Scottish bank with debt, leading to a \u00a345.5 billion government bailout.\n\nWhile Sunak\u2019s biggest riches will probably come after he eventually resigns as an MP, there are several new income avenues he can eventually look forward to.\n\nEvidence suggests that if Sunak returns to the finance world after he leaves politics, he will be in high demand.\n\nSunak\u2019s fellow former chancellor George Osbourne has minted fresh millions through city advisory roles with groups including Blackrock and Robey Warshaw, in addition to his time editing London\u2019s Evening Standard newspaper.\n\nOr, he could take a cautious lesson from David Cameron. The man who served as PM between 2010 and 2016 landed himself in hot water over his role in the collapsed finance group Greensill Capital.\n\nCameron reportedly got $10 million from Greensill to lobby the government on behalf of the company, but his spokesperson disputed that figure.\n\nSpeaking engagements\n\nThe easiest mileage for Sunak\u2019s bank account after leaving office will likely see him harness his years of training as a public speaker.\n\nTony Blair, the ninth-longest running PM of all time, set a marker after he retired, reportedly commanding \u00a31 million in 2012 from his engagements. His Tory successors have been keen to follow that trend.\n\nIn the year between stepping down as prime minister and resigning as an MP, the mercurial Boris Johnson bagged millions of dollars from extracurricular activities as he settled into post-leadership life.\n\nDocuments from May 2023 show Johnson was paid around \u00a33.5 million for speaking engagements after stepping down as PM. He also received a \u00a3510,000 advance on a book deal. Theresa May, Johnson\u2019s predecessor, has also enjoyed the speaking circuit since quitting as PM in 2019.\n\nFamily wealth\n\nWhat is unique for Sunak among his contemporaries, however, is that the PM never needs to work again.\n\nSunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, are worth a combined \u00a3651 million ($830 million), according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List, making him richer than King Charles.\n\nThe vast majority of that wealth comes from Murty\u2019s holdings in the Indian IT company Infosys, which her billionaire father co-founded.\n\nMurty\u2019s wealth was a hot point of contention during Sunak\u2019s premiership owing to her \u201cnon-dom\u201d status, which meant she didn\u2019t pay tax on income from shares in the foreign-owned Infosys. Murty vowed to pay U.K. tax on this after a media storm.\n\nSunak will remain an MP until he decides otherwise, like Boris Johnson or David Cameron before him.\n\nBut when he does go, the man who led the Tories to their worst defeat in nearly two centuries will quickly be absorbed into a multimillion-dollar corporate cushion shared by most of his former allies.",
        "summary": "Rishi Sunak is no longer the U.K. Prime Minister.\nSunak made nearly \u00a31.8 million in capital gains last year and paid a total of \u00a3500,000 in tax.\nSpeaking engagementsThe easiest mileage for Sunak\u2019s bank account after leaving office will likely see him harness his years of training as a public speaker.\nMurty vowed to pay U.K. tax on this after a media storm.\nSunak will remain an MP until he decides otherwise, like Boris Johnson or David Cameron before him.",

        "title": "Civics are becoming a 21st-century business skill",
        "body": "The Fourth of July is a day typically filled with food, festivities, and fireworks in the U.S., as our nation celebrates the passage of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. But this day commemorates something else, too.\n\nOur celebration of Independence Day is an opportunity to reflect on our country\u2014the progress we have made and the work we must still do to strengthen our democracy and communities as we look toward the future.\n\nLike a successful business, democracy only works when all of its components function well. The very skills that formed this great experiment are the same skills that spark the inspiration and innovation necessary for breakthrough ideas and continued economic growth. In other words, civics is a 21st-century business skill.\n\nCritical thinking, problem-solving, negotiation, curiosity, adaptability, shared risk-taking, and other so-called \u201csoft skills\u201d are increasingly called \u201cdurable skills\u201d because there\u2019s nothing soft about them. In fact, a recent LinkedIn survey found that nine out of 10 global executives say they are more important than ever in the workplace.\n\nCollaboration and shared risk-taking\n\nin government, facilitating and making decisions requires people to work together. Whether it\u2019s running a polling station on Election Day or serving on a municipal committee, the path to getting things done includes working with others who may hold opinions and ideas that are quite different from your own.\n\nWhile our neighborhoods, houses of worship, schools, and other places where we gather with others may be homogenous, in the workplace, we are likely to encounter people who are different from us.\n\nWhen team members with varied opinions and perspectives can work respectfully and effectively together, organizations win. Companies and teams adept in durable skills can be expected to deliver greater employee morale, improved product service or quality, and increased innovation, to name a few.\n\nDefusing conflict and solving problems\n\nFailure to understand how our government works is preventing people from finding common ground on basic issues. This lack of knowledge foments division, frustration, and ultimately, incivility and an inability to communicate effectively with others, especially those who see the world differently.\n\nMost Americans believe the nation\u2019s tone is uncivil (58%). However, when people have a shared understanding of organizations and processes, they can listen to others\u2019 arguments and make strong rationales of their own. In doing so, they can better use reason to compromise and manage conflict.\n\nHoning negotiation skills\n\nThink about the way legislation is often crafted: Someone has an idea for change. Others may disagree. In an ideal world, they discuss their differences, find common ground, and draft legislation made stronger by a range of viewpoints.\n\nIncreasingly, managers are concerned about their team members\u2019 unwillingness to compromise and inability to sit together and come to an agreement. By many accounts, our founding fathers held wildly differing opinions and argued fiercely. However, they were able to reach compromises that became our nation\u2019s foundation.\n\nTraining critical thinking\n\nWhile sometimes met with chagrin, jury duty is one of the most important ways citizens participate in our system of governance.\n\nBeing a good juror requires weighing evidence, questioning our own preconceptions, and asking good questions. These are the same critical thinking skills necessary in making key organizational decisions.\n\nBuilding leaders\n\nUnderstanding and participating in how our government is run teaches us how to operate in complex systems, navigate change, and use good judgment and reason to reach a goal. In short, civic engagement builds leaders who can apply those skills in myriad ways, including in the workplace.\n\nAmericans are eager for employers to help build bridges, create healthier discourse, and strengthen cooperation in the communities they serve. Eighty-two percent of Americans believe that businesses can play a role in bringing our country together, and nearly 75% of voters agree that businesses have a responsibility to protect our economic system and national environment.\n\nBusinesses can take small yet meaningful steps to boost civic engagement. For example, employers may offer their employees time off to serve as nonpartisan poll workers during local, state, and national elections, addressing a critical shortage across America. Or they can support employees selected for jury service by providing resources to help them prepare for their duties. They can also provide educational experiences that reintroduce employees to civics basics, empowering them to learn more about how our government works and how they can meaningfully participate. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation runs one of several such initiatives that help employers enhance civic skills within their teams.\n\nAs we prepare to celebrate Independence Day, now is the time for the business community to commit to elevating civics education and skills in the workplace.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",

        "body": "The swagger is back in Tesla\u2019s step.\n\nA few months ago, Elon Musk\u2019s company was the butt of every joke on Wall Street, a growth stock with no growth to quote Wells Fargo. Pundits began questioning why anyone still even included it among the high-flying Magnificent Seven after Tesla trailed all 499 other stocks in the benchmark S&P index\u2014even the scandal-ridden Boeing.\n\nNo longer. Just in time for the start of the second half, Tesla has fully recouped its year-to-date losses after adding an eye-watering $150 billion in value to its market cap over the span of just three days this week.\n\n\u201cThe worst is in the rearview mirror for Tesla as we believe the EV demand story is starting to return to the disruptive tech stalwart,\u201d Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives wrote on Wednesday, upgrading his price target to $300 from $275 and reaffirming his \u201coutperform\u201d rating.\n\nMusk is now back to his brash old self, exchanging one fantastical growth target that defies human reason for another while warning any short seller that gets in his way will be \u201cobliterated\u201d\u2014Bill Gates included.\n\nAfter consolidating around $180 for the better part of two months, bulls see further room for gains after the stock broke above the 200-day moving average under heavy trading volume and now looks like it could snap the three-year downward trend.\n\nTesla $TSLA has done it! 2.5 year downtrend finally broken \ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udec2 pic.twitter.com/9kEQejJoNb \u2014 Barchart (@Barchart) July 3, 2024\n\nWhen one popular pro-Tesla account reminded the fan community late last month of the 2019 words of ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood regarding chart technicals that \u201cthe longer the base, the bigger the break out,\u201d Musk quickly replied: \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nQ2 deliveries beat reduced expectations\n\nThis belief the stock has bottomed out and is poised to continue its rally in the coming months is reflected in some of the fundamentals now emerging.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement of second-quarter vehicle deliveries for example was a stark contrast to the first quarter figures that badly missed even the most bearish of forecasts. After expectations had consistently fallen in recent weeks, Tesla finally managed to draw a line under the issue by beating consensus with a comparatively mild decline in car sales.\n\nMassive growth in its lucrative energy storage business also helped support the argument it is not just an EV company, as deployment volumes more than doubled over the previous quarterly record.\n\nMany analysts and investors had until recently argued they needed to see an end to the downward revisions in earnings estimates before sentiment could sustainably improve.\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s deliveries surprise, bulls like Ives\u2014who described the Q1 volumes as both a \u201cnightmare\u201d and \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d\u2014now believe the company has renewed the market\u2019s faith in its growth story.\n\n\u201cThis was a huge comeback performance from Tesla and Musk in 2Q with the Street expecting a clear miss this quarter with EV demand still choppy globally, yet Tesla delivered strong numbers at a key time for investors,\u201d he continued.\n\nWith painfully high interest rates expected to ease later this year, the Aug. 8 reveal of the CyberCab robotaxi just around the corner, and a new entry level Tesla slated to debut around six months from now, the stock could be poised for further gains. It may even earn back its place in the pantheon of the Magnificent Seven.",

        "body": "Chinese automaker BYD inaugurated its first electric vehicle plant in Thailand on Thursday, part of the company\u2019s push into Southeast Asia while it also tackles wealthier markets in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nThe factory\u2019s opening comes on the same day that the European Union is expected to begin imposing higher tariffs on EVs made in China due to concerns over competition from the cheaper-priced imports.\n\nIn the U.S., the Biden administration also is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. The U.S. currently imports very few Chinese cars, but like the European Commission, it worries that subsidies hurt domestic companies and cost jobs.\n\nThe new factory in Rayong, south of Bangkok, was built in just 16 months and has an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles. It makes several BYD models and also batteries and transmissions. Its opening on Thursday was marked with great fanfare and included the presentation of a BYD Dolphin, a compact hatchback, to a charitable foundation under the patronage of the Thai royal family.\n\nThat vehicle was the 8 millionth vehicle manufactured by BYD, the company said.\n\nThailand aims to have 30% of all vehicles made in the country be electric by 2030. One in every three EVs sold in Thailand is made by BYD, though most cars on the roads now are still gas or diesel powered.\n\nBYD, which stands for \u201cBuild Your Dreams,\u201d sold 3 million vehicles last year and its exports more than tripled to 243,000. In the first half of this year, the company sold 1.6 million EVs.\n\nIt sold 30,650 EVs in Thailand last year and plans for its new factory to make the Dolphin, Atto 3, Seal and Sealion 6 EV models.\n\nBYD says the new factory is expected to create 10,000 jobs. Apart from Thailand and China, BYD also has or is building factories in Brazil, Hungary and Uzbekistan.\n\nAccording to BYD, the Dolphin can run 490 kilometers (about 300 miles) on a single charge. During a recent auto show in Bangkok, models on display were priced at 859,999 baht ($23,700), though reports said BYD would be offering steep discounts in Thailand on vehicles made in the new factory.",

The government is given to understand that Tesla has capital issues and doesn\u2019t plan on pledging fresh investment into India in the near future, they said.\n\nThe loss of interest in India comes as Tesla reported a second consecutive drop in quarterly deliveries globally and faces heightened competition in China. Musk announced major staff reductions in April, the EV maker\u2019s first new model in years, the Cybertruck, has been slow to ramp up while construction of a new plant in Mexico has been delayed.\n\nRepresentatives from India\u2019s Ministry of Heavy Industries, which oversees the automobile sector, and the ministries of finance, and commerce and industry, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Tesla also didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk in April scrapped a planned visit to India that would have included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing pressing issues at the company.\n\nHe had originally announced his visit just weeks after India lowered the import taxes on EVs from foreign carmakers that pledge to invest at least 41.5 billion rupees ($497 million) and start EV production from a local factory within three years.\n\nInstead, India\u2019s government is pinning its hopes on domestic automakers like Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. to boost EV production, the people said. Should Musk decide to re-engage, Tesla would still be welcome to avail itself of the new import tax policy, they added.\n\nIndia\u2019s EV market is in its infancy, with battery-powered cars accounting for just 1.3% of the total last year, according to BloombergNEF.

        "body": "Amsterdam is fed up with its tourist deluge.\n\nThe Dutch city attracts all types of visitors\u2014whether they\u2019re coming to party or visit tulip fields\u2014 but in recent years has become a victim of overtourism and has tried to cap its number of tourists.\n\nLast year\u2019s \u201cStay Away\u201d campaign was part of its efforts to discourage travelers from tainting Amsterdam with their \u201cnuisance,\u201d as Deputy Mayor Sofyan Mbarki put it.\n\nNow Amsterdam is planning to crack down on cruise ships too.\n\nThe Dutch capital city plans to limit cruise ships in its harbor to just 100 in 2026, down from 190 currently, before banning them outright by 2035, Amsterdam\u2019s council announced last week. It added that it was part of a raft of measures to put a lid on tourism and \u201cto counteract nuisance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSea cruises are polluting and cause crowds and emissions in the city,\u201d the council said in its release. \u201cWe want Amsterdam to be clean, liveable and sustainable.\u201d\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s City Council didn\u2019t immediately return Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTourists visiting the city take boat trips on the canals in Amsterdam. Ozgen Besli\u2014Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nCracking down on overtourism\n\nThe move to ban inbound cruises has been in the works for a while. Amsterdam wanted to redirect cruise liners to terminals outside the main city area as they brought tourists who crowded the streets. In 2022, the city\u2019s mayor blamed cruise tourists for swarming the city but doing little for it.\n\nThe record-high tourist numbers, up from 12.6 million in 2019 to 15.1 million in 2023, have spurred the crackdown. This spike in visitors has overwhelmed the city\u2019s infrastructure, such as its public transport networks and quaint streets.\n\nAmsterdam is home to some of the most picturesque water canals and museums. But over the years, it\u2019s gained the reputation of a party city\u2014one it\u2019s trying to distance itself from. The Dutch capital has tightened rules on smoking weed, especially in its red-light district, and banned new hotels from being built earlier this year.\n\nCruises aren\u2019t the main avenue to enter Amsterdam, but they\u2019re certainly among the most polluting forms of it. One cruise, carrying thousands of passengers at once, can result in the same levels of emissions per day as 30,000 trucks, a 2021 study found.\n\nFor similar reasons, European cities such as Dubrovnik and Santorini have also capped cruise ship numbers. Venice has enacted a \u201ctourist tax\u201d of \u20ac5 ($5.4) to help fight overtourism.\n\nIn addition to cutting cruise emissions, Amsterdam will require boats to only shore power, an alternative to the existing diesel fuel that reduces pollution, by 2027. It\u2019s also looking to cut the number of river cruises in its waters.\n\nAll the efforts to restrict tourism could prove counterproductive for Amsterdam as it stands to lose between \u20ac46 million ($50 million) and \u20ac103 million ($111 million) in revenue, Bloomberg reported. The City Council recognizes this but thinks it \u201ccannot afford to sit back and wait for things to get worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do this now, we will become less attractive as a city for people and companies. And that will cost more money in the long run,\u201d a council spokesperson told the outlet.",

        "title": "Russia intensifies disinformation campaigns against France as elections and Paris Olympics draw near",
        "body": "Photos of blood-red hands on a Holocaust memorial. Caskets at the Eiffel Tower. A fake French military recruitment drive calling for soldiers in Ukraine, and major French news sites improbably registered in an obscure Pacific territory, population 15,000.\n\nAll are part of disinformation campaigns orchestrated out of Russia and targeting France, according to French officials and cybersecurity experts in Europe and the United States. France\u2019s legislative elections and the Paris Olympics sent them into overdrive.\n\nMore than a dozen reports issued in the past year point to an intensifying effort from Russia to undermine France, particularly the upcoming Games, and President Emmanuel Macron, who is one of Ukraine\u2019s most vocal supporters in Europe.\n\nThe Russian campaigns sowing anti-French disinformation began online early last summer but first became tangible in October 2023 when more than 1,000 bots linked to Russia relayed photos of graffitied Stars of David in Paris and its suburbs.\n\nA French intelligence report said the Russian intelligence agency FSB ordered the tagging, as well as subsequent vandalism of a memorial to those who helped rescue Jews from the Holocaust.\n\nPhotos from each event were amplified on social media by fake accounts linked to the Russian disinformation site RRN, according to cybersecurity experts. Russia denies any such campaigns. The French intelligence report says RRN is part of a larger operation orchestrated by Sergei Kiriyenko, a ranking Kremlin official.\n\n\u201cYou have to see this as an ecosystem,\u201d said a French military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal information about the Russian effort. \u201cIt\u2019s a hybrid strategy.\u201d\n\nThe tags and the vandalism had no direct link to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, but they provoked a strong reaction from the French political class, with denunciations in the legislature and public debate. Antisemitic attacks are on the rise in France, and the war in Gaza has proven divisive.\n\nThe Stars of David could be interpreted either as support for Israel or as opposition. The effect was to sow division and unease. French Jews in particular have found themselves unwittingly thrust into the political fray despite, at just 500,000 people, making up a small proportion of the French population.\n\nIn March, just after Macron discussed the possibility of mobilizing the French military in Ukraine, a fake recruitment drive went up for the French army in Ukraine, spawning a series of posts in Russian- and French-language Telegram channels that got picked up in Russian and Belarusian media, according to a separate French government report seen by The Associated Press. On June 1, caskets appeared outside the Eiffel Tower, bearing the inscription \u201cFrench soldiers in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe larger disinformation efforts show little traction in France, but the Russian audience may have been the real target, officials said, by showing that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is, as Putin has said, really a war with the West.\n\nAmong the broader goals, the French military official said, was a long-term and steady effort to sow social discord, erode faith in the media and democratic governments, undermine NATO, and sap Western support for Ukraine. Denigrating the Olympics, from which most Russian athletes are banned, is a bonus, according to French officials monitoring the increasingly strident posts warning of imminent unrest ahead of the Games.\n\nOn June 9, the French far-right National Rally trounced Macron\u2019s party in elections for the European Parliament. The party has historically been close to Russia: one of its leading figures, Marine Le Pen, cultivated ties to Putin for many years and supported Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. And its leading contender for prime minister, Jordan Bardella, has said he opposes sending long-range weapons to Kyiv.\n\nIn more than 4,400 posts gathered since mid-November by antibot4navalny, a collective that analyzes Russian bot behavior, those targeting audiences in France and Germany predominated. The number of weekly posts ranged from 100 to 200 except for the week of May 5, when it dropped near zero, the data showed. That week, as it happens, was a holiday in Russia.\n\nMany of the posts redirect either to RRN or to sites that appear identical to major French media, but with the domain \u2013 and content \u2013 changed. At least two of the more recent mirrored sites are registered in Wallis and Futuna, a French Pacific territory 10 time zones from Paris. A click on the top of the fake page redirects back to the real news sites themselves to give the impression of authenticity. Other posts redirect to original sites controlled by the the campaign itself, dubbed Doppelganger.\n\nThe redirects shifted focus for the European elections and continued after Macron called the surprise legislative elections with just three weeks to spare. Three-quarters of posts from the week ahead of the June 30 first-round legislative vote that were directed toward a French audience focused on either criticizing Macron or boosting the National Rally, antibot4navalny found in data shared with The Associated Press.\n\nOne post on a fake site purported to be from Le Point, a current affairs magazine, and the French news agency AFP, criticizing Macron.\n\n\u201cOur leaders have no idea how ordinary French people live but are ready to destroy France in the name of aid for Ukraine,\u201d read the headline on June 25.\n\nAnother site falsely claimed to be from Macron\u2019s party, offering to pay 100 euros for a vote for him \u2013 and linking back to the party\u2019s true website. And still another inadvertently left a generative AI prompt calling for the re-write of an article \u201ctaking a conservative stance against the liberal policies of the Macron administration,\u201d according to findings last week from Insikt Group, the threat research division of the cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re scraping automatically, sending the text to the AI and asking the AI to introduce bias or slants into the article and rewrite it,\u201d said Cl\u00e9ment Briens, an analyst for Recorded Future.\n\nBriens said metrics tools embedded within the site are likely intended to prove that the campaigns were money well-spent for \u201cwhoever is doing the payouts for these operations.\u201d\n\nThe French government cybersecurity watchdog, Viginum, has published multiple reports since June 2023 singling out Russian efforts to sow divisions in France and elsewhere.

        "body": "Portugal\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship with foreign workers has just taken another twist, as the country plans to bring back contentious tax breaks that its old Prime Minister called a \u201cfiscal injustice.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Prime Minister Joaquim Miranda Sarmento told the Financial Times that his center-right government would bring legislation on Thursday to reintroduce tax breaks to lure foreigners to Portugal.\n\nSarmento said the switch is part of a body of legislation aimed at stimulating Portugal\u2019s economy and \u201cattracting some people to the country.\u201d\n\nThe country scrapped the 20% flat tax rate charged to those in \u201chigh value-added\u201d jobs like doctors, tech workers, and journalists in October. Instead, skilled foreign workers would fall under the same progressive tax rate as Portuguese citizens, ranging from 14.5% to 48%.\n\nThe decision was expected to deter high-skilled foreigners from migrating to Portugal, who would face higher charges on income earned there.\n\nPortugal\u2019s U-turn means foreign workers will receive the 20% flat rate on \u201csalaries and professional income\u201d rather than all income like before. That means things like dividends, capital gains, and pensions will not benefit from a tax break.\n\nThe move marks the latest twist in the country\u2019s complicated relationship with foreign workers.\n\n\u201cWith the newly refined NHR, the government is inviting actively engaged talent focussed on innovation, entrepreneurship and education; a cohort of people who will start companies, create IP, employ and educate the future talent of Portugal as opposed to retirees whose contribution to the economy is mostly through real estate acquisition taxes, and taxes on bought good and services,\u201d Julian Johnson, a co-founder of Golden Visa investment group Tejo Ventures, told Fortune.\n\nPortugal\u2019s migrant mixup\n\nThe country has sought to attract young, skilled foreigners since its economy was devastated by the global financial crisis in 2009. As the COVID-19 pandemic shifted working patterns, Portugal\u2019s capital of Lisbon became the homeland of newly coined \u201cDigital Nomads.\u201d\n\nOpponents of these inflows regard them as devastating to the cost of living of Portuguese residents, among the EU\u2019s lowest-income workers. They also blame the knock-on effect of that higher income on spiraling house prices in the country, adding to unaffordability.\n\nWhen the tax breaks were scrapped in October last year, then-Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa described them as a \u201cfiscal injustice\u201d and a \u201cbiased way\u201d of inflating the housing market.\n\nMigration advisors told Fortune last October that the decision to axe these tax breaks may have inadvertently created a brief swell of new applicants rushing to immigrate to Portugal before the law was changed.\n\nPortugal also made sweeping changes to its \u201cGolden Visa\u201d program last year, which previously allowed foreigners to gain residency by buying property worth at least \u20ac500,000 ($540,000). The country scrapped that avenue, meaning only higher investment options were available for prospective residents.\n\nWhile Portugal is again liberalizing its approach to skilled foreigners, it is standing firm on its taxes against older immigrants. The exemption of pensions from tax breaks is expected to stop older people migrating to the country for sun and higher income.\n\n\u201cThe bet here is that in combination with the Golden Visa program and other working visas, the tax regime will entice growth actors, builders, and doers to help develop Portugal into its future, stymying the outflow of young Portuguese seeking work overseas, whilst inviting new highly skilled immigration,\u201d Tejo Venture\u2019s Johnson said. \u201cThe end goal is a flourishing economy, a larger tax base to support Portugal\u2019s societal ambitions and the care of its aging population.\u201d\n\nPopulation crisis\n\nThanks to a continent-wide aging population crisis, Portugal is locked in a demographic battle with the rest of Europe\u2019s economies.\n\nHowever, long described as the most migrant-friendly nation in the EU, Portugal is getting more selective with who it lets in under its right-leaning government.\n\nIn June, the country said it would scrap its \u201cmanifestation of interest\u201d immigration clause, which allowed non-EU citizens to come to the country without a guaranteed job and apply for residency after a year of making social security payments.\n\nScrapping the clause appeared to be directed at lower-income migrants from countries like India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, who took advantage of it most.",

        "title": "Biden vows to run despite eroding support from Democrats",
        "body": "A defiant President Joe Biden vowed Wednesday to keep running for reelection, rejecting growing pressure from Democrats to withdraw after a disastrous debate performance raised questions about his readiness to keep campaigning, much less win in November.\n\nBut increasingly ominous signs were mounting for the president. Two Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to exit the race while a leading ally publicly suggested how the party might choose someone else. And senior aides said they believed he might only have a matter of days to show he was up to the challenge before anxiety in the party boils over.\n\n\u201cLet me say this as clearly as I possibly can as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running \u2026 no one\u2019s pushing me out,\u201d Biden said on a call with staffers from his reelection campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I\u2019m in this race to the end and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nIn his private conversations, Biden was focused on efforts to course correct from his rocky debate and on the threat that, in his view, former President Donald Trump poses to the country, as he scoured for feedback on what went wrong last Thursday in Atlanta and took responsibility for his performance.\n\n\u201cWe had a direct, open, clear-eyed conversation about the debate, his thoughts on what happened and why it wasn\u2019t his best evening or best debate,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who spoke with Biden on Tuesday, said in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cHe wanted advice. He was asking earnestly for input and comment on what he should do to restore confidence and support, and what\u2019s the best path forward.\u201d\n\nCoons, the president\u2019s closest ally on Capitol Hill, said Biden clearly understood the urgency, the difficulty and the importance of the election, as the senator advised that the president do more unscripted, open-ended events to restore confidence in his candidacy. The two also spoke about Biden\u2019s schedule and its impact on his political efforts, particularly as he balances that task with critical governing tasks such as the NATO summit in Washington next week.\n\nBiden\u2019s efforts to pull multiple levers to salvage his faltering reelection include his impromptu appearance with campaign aides, private conversations with senior lawmakers, a weekend blitz of travel and a network television interview. But he was confronting serious indications that support for him was rapidly eroding on Capitol Hill and among other allies.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, D-Ariz., told The New York Times that though he backs Biden as long as he is a candidate, this \u201cis an opportunity to look elsewhere\u201d and what Biden \u201cneeds to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat \u2014 and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.\u201d\n\nSenior advisers say they believe the 81-year-old Biden may have mere days to mount a convincing display of his fitness for office before his party\u2019s panic over his debate performance and anger about his response boils over, according to two people with knowledge who insisted on anonymity to more freely discuss strategy. The president accepts the urgency of the task \u2014 having reviewed the polling and mountains of media coverage \u2014 but he is convinced he can do that in the coming days and insistent that he will not step out of the race, they said.\n\nBiden met for more than hour at the White House on Wednesday night, in person and virtually, with more than 20 Democratic governors who afterward described the conversation as \u201ccandid\u201d but said they were standing behind Biden despite being concerned about a Trump victory in November.\n\n\u201cThe president is our nominee. The president is our party leader,\u201d said Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland. He added that, in the meeting, Biden \u201cwas very clear that he\u2019s in this to win.\u201d\n\nDespite such reassuring sentiments, a major Democratic donor, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, also called on the president to exit the race, saying, \u201cBiden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous.\u201d The statement was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nAnd all that followed Rep. Jim Clyburn, a longtime Biden friend and confidant, saying he\u2019d back a \u201cmini-primary\u201d in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention next month if Biden were to leave the race. The South Carolina Democrat floated an idea that appeared to be laying the groundwork for alternative choices by delegates during the Democrats\u2019 planned virtual roll call that is scheduled before the more formal party convention set to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nOn CNN, Clyburn said Vice President Kamala Harris, governors and others could join the competition: \u201cIt would be fair to everybody.\u201d\n\nClyburn, a senior lawmaker who is a former member of his party\u2019s House leadership team, said he has not personally seen the president act as he did on the debate stage last week and called it \u201cconcerning.\u201d\n\nAnd even as other Democratic allies have remained quiet since Thursday\u2019s debate, there is a growing private frustration about the Biden campaign\u2019s response to his disastrous debate performance at a crucial moment in the campaign \u2014 particularly in Biden waiting several days to do direct damage control with senior members of his own party.\n\nOne Democratic aide said the lacking response has been worse than the debate performance itself, saying lawmakers who support Biden want to see him directly combatting the concerns about his stamina in front of reporters and voters. The aide was granted anonymity to candidly discuss interparty dynamics.\n\nMost Democratic lawmakers are taking a wait-and-see approach with Biden, though, holding out for a better idea of how the situation plays out through new polling and Biden\u2019s scheduled ABC News interview, according to Democratic lawmakers who requested anonymity to speak bluntly about the president.\n\nWhen Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who called on Biden to leave the race this week, shopped around his move for support from other Democratic lawmakers, he had no takers and eventually issued a statement on his own, according to a person familiar with the effort granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nBut there was also a sense that the waiting period will soon expire if Biden does not step up his outreach to Capitol Hill or prove otherwise that he\u2019s up to the job.\n\nSome suggested Harris was emerging as the favorite to replace Biden if he were to withdraw, although those involved in private discussions acknowledge that Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan remain viable alternatives. But for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the best prospect to quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.\n\nEven as pressure around Biden mounted, he and Harris made a surprise appearance on an all-staff reelection campaign call and offered a pep talk. They stressed how important it was to beat Trump, the presumptive nominee, in November and returned to Biden\u2019s previous post-debate vow that when he gets knocked down, he gets up again.\n\n\u201cJust as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we\u2019re going to beat him again in 2024,\u201d said Biden, who told participants that he would not be dragged out of the race. Harris added: \u201cWe will not back down. We will follow our president\u2019s lead. We will fight, and we will win.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked during her briefing with reporters whether Biden would consider stepping down. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI cannot lay out something that would change the president\u2019s mind,\u201d Jean-Pierre said about Biden continuing to seek a second term.\n\nStill, Democrats are unsatisfied with the explanations of Biden\u2019s debate performance, from both White House staff and the president himself. And there is a deeper frustration among some in the party who feel that Biden should have handled questions about his stumbling debate performance much sooner and that he has put them in a difficult position by staying in the race.\n\nThe Leadership Now Project, a group of business executives, academics and thought leaders, said in a letter that the \u201cthreat of a second Trump term\u201d is great enough that Biden should \u201cpass the torch of this year\u2019s presidential nomination to the next generation of highly capable Democrats.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign issued a statement noting that \u201cevery Democrat\u201d now calling on the president \u201cto quit was once a supporter of Biden.\u201d\n\nTrump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after last week\u2019s debate. One poll, conducted by SSRS for CNN, found that three-quarters of voters \u2014 including more than half of Democratic voters \u2014 said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.\n\nAbout 7 in 10 voters, and 45% of Democrats, said Biden\u2019s physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him, according to the CNN/SSRS poll.\n\nAnd about 6 in 10 voters, including about one-quarter of Democrats, said reelecting Biden would be a risky choice for the country rather than a safe one, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll. That poll found that Democrats were split on whether Biden should remain the nominee.\n\nBiden campaign pollster Molly Murphy said \u201ctoday\u2019s polling doesn\u2019t fundamentally change the course of the race.\u201d\n\nIn a further effort to boost morale, Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients urged White House aides during an all-staff meeting to tune out the \u201cnoise\u201d and focus on the task of governing.\n\nBiden himself began making personal outreach on his own, speaking privately with senior Democratic lawmakers such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Coons and Clyburn.",

        "title": "George Odenyo: Judge my success by my value",
        "body": "If you broke into George Odenyo\u2019s office at Delta Towers you would face two puzzling scenarios. One, you wouldn\u2019t be able to nick anything, and two, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to know what he does for a living. This is because his office is bare.\n\nThere is a table with a computer. No papers. No trays, no photos of his family. No trophies. There is a lonesome coat hanger and a small glass plaque that his children gifted him for Father\u2019s Day. It brings to mind that quote by Ram Dass: \u201cEmptiness is not really empty, emptiness is full of everything. The \u2018everything\u2019 just isn\u2019t manifest.\u201d Or he might just be a minimalist.\n\nOdenyo is the CEO of American Tower Company (ATC), the American real estate investment firm that owns, develops, and operates wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure - towers, telecom masts - in several countries. ATC owns about 4,000 towers across Kenya that host Telkom, Safaricom, Airtel, and other small telecom companies on a shared infrastructure platform.\n\nHis resume is as minimalist as his office; he\u2019s worked in two organisations, according to his LinkedIn profile. For 14 years he worked with MTN Business, leaving as Head of Finance. Then five years with Eaton Towers as Finance Director before the company was acquired by ATC.\n\nYour desk is so bare. Are you a minimalist or are you hardly in the office?\n\nI have the right team in the company so my desk doesn\u2019t have to look busy. Part of me is also opposed to holding onto things, I try to release them as soon as possible. If there's nothing I can do with it, I give it to the next person who can address it.\n\nHow much does one tower cost and what does it take to build one?\n\nFirst, our customer, the operator, has to identify where they want the tower, which is driven by need, often determined by the population. We will then acquire the site, and get the necessary permits from the National Environmental Management Authority, Kenya Civil Aviation, and county governments. Once we acquire the site we erect the tower and then power it with a grid. A tower costs about $150,000 (Sh19.3 million), give or take.\n\nAs a numbers guy, how do you find transitioning to dealing with people?\n\nWell, I have appreciated that as a leader, you are as strong as your people. I have led teams in my previous roles so it\u2019s not entirely new. People can be difficult but the trick lies in figuring out how to understand them. Everybody is motivated by something; a dream or ambition and it\u2019s upon you to connect them with whatever it is. So my job is to find how their dreams connect with the company's dreams.\n\nAnd what's your dream?\n\nMake life better for me, my family, and my community. I seek to be impactful, and valuable; to change the world.\n\nDo you feel like you are doing that here at ATC, building towers?\n\nYes, I am. Our purpose is to build a more connected Africa. Towers connect people by enabling them to communicate well. Most misunderstandings come from people not being able to communicate.\n\nDid you always want to be in finance?\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t know about finance until later. When I was in high school my late father invited somebody to have a chat with me, a guy who had excelled in his high school and was then in university. The talk was not more than five minutes. He talked about CPA (Certified Public Accountant) a lot. He said it was something I could do as I waited to go to university. I was sold on the idea. I then eagerly waited for KCA to announce applications in the newspapers. I would bother the principal (St Marys Yala) for the newspaper every week to check if the call was out. That\u2019s how I came across Strathmore in the newspaper and applied and eventually enrolled.\n\nSo if this fellow was a doctor do you think you would have been influenced to study medicine?\n\nYes, definitely. However, in high school, I was good at electricity and my dream was to be an electrical engineer. But this guy came earlier before that could happen. [Chuckle]\n\nAmerica Tower Corporation Kenya CEO George Odenyo during the interview on June 24, 2024 at his office in Nairobi. Photo credit: Billy Ogada | Nation Media Group\n\nIs there a chance that you might still pursue that love?\n\nNo, I'm in that environment either way. I have so many engineers here. So I still enjoy what I do because of that. In hindsight, I think there's a reason why things happen the way they happen. I have no regrets.\n\nHave you had conversations with yourself about what your purpose is, and why you are here? Are you here to build masts?\n\nI think we are in this world to create an impact, to make a difference. I believe that helping others is integral to our purpose. I have benefited from the generosity of others in my entire journey, some of whom were not even my relatives. So I\u2019m also doing the same. It makes me happy to see others excel. My earlier years were instrumental in shaping who I have become.\n\nBy the time I was joining the University of Nairobi, I was already done with part two of my CPA which allowed me to get an internship that eventually turned into a job. Against the wishes of my parents and the advice of other people close to me, I decided to drop out of university. I completed my CPA later at Catholic University. I have worked and learned, not the other way around.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nI\u2019m 45 now. I was born in Pumwani but my dad moved to the village when I was five or so years old. It's a place called Ugunja in Nyanza, you might know it. I struggled academically in my earlier years until around Class Six when I met a teacher who changed how I viewed academics and helped me excel. I\u2019m the only son in a family of three girls and that didn\u2019t help in those years when I was not performing well because my mom was on my case.\n\nWhat was the impact of growing up in a family of girls as the only boy?\n\nQuite interesting. You learn a lot about women without realising it. But also perhaps that made me more empathetic to women. I wasn\u2019t spared from chores because I was the only boy, in fact, sometimes I was made to do a little more. My dad believed in me. Unfortunately, he died when I was 25 years old.\n\nWho filled the role of a father for you after he died?\n\nWhen he died I became the 'father' in the family. My mom handed everything over to me. She died two years ago.\n\nDo you have children?\n\nI have three; an 18, a 17, and a 10-year-old. A boy and two girls. This is a plaque they gifted me for Father\u2019s Day.\n\nCan you believe you have a 18-year-old?\n\n[Laughs] Yes, I can. It's because I started so early. I started working at 21 and that changed my life because when money started coming in, my old man, to ensure I did not get lost, encouraged me to find a wife and settle down. So at 25 I was already married and I started a family immediately.\n\nWhat bits of fatherhood do you find very challenging?\n\nBecause I grew up in a different time it\u2019s challenging to appreciate the circumstances that our children are growing up in now. It\u2019s often difficult to relate to them and their situation. Everything is different and sometimes you want your child to see things your way but they can\u2019t. You have to accept that it is their life and love them. You cannot control their lives. But I try as much as possible to make sure that I pass the right baton to them.\n\nDo you think you're successful?\n\nAs a father?\n\nNo, as a man who lives and works.\n\nI don't talk about success. I talk about being valuable. Am I valuable? Yes, for sure. I believe that as long as you are valuable out here in the community, in society, and in the family, then success will follow you.\n\nHow do you know for certain that you're valuable?\n\nBecause of what you're able to give. You are valuable because of what you are giving at work, at home, and in your community. I believe that as long as you are growing, over time you become valuable. You become valuable by the knowledge that you can share and by the guidance you can give. And that way success can follow you in this season.\n\nWhat are some of the most difficult things you are experiencing in this season as a man?\n\nThings are moving so fast and I wonder if I will achieve everything I have set out to achieve. But other than that, I think it's a beautiful time to be alive, to be a father, to be a leader, to be living and doing things that need to be done.\n\nWhen your son gets to the age where he says, I found a wife. What are the top three pieces of advice you will give him?\n\nOne, I will let him know that this is his decision, not mine, not his mother's. It is his calling. So he has to take that responsibility single-handedly, of course with support.",

        "body": "The workplace is experiencing a historic transformation as more and more younger people whose lives revolve around the Internet of Things, mobile phones, and social media are hired.\n\nWith the latest breed of employees being outspoken, outgoing, and carefree, Gen Z is rewriting norms and daily practices that define a workplace.\n\nAway from the four-walled offices with a kitchen and boardroom, as well as individual offices for senior management, we now have a hybrid mode of working that allows people to work away from the office and for longer hours than older generations ever did.\n\nWith the Internet readily available everywhere, knowledge of labour rights has expanded, and we now interact more virtually than physically.\n\nSocial media sites are now considered official modes of communication. Not to mention the change of the official (office) dress code, the new \u2018normal\u2019 hardly observes any mode of dressing as part of office etiquette, and performance is gauged on the delivery of tasks assigned.\n\nWhat this means to organisations is that to attract and retain the best and brightest of Generation Z, it will require a different mindset. A large percentage of Gen Z is characterised by their passion for technology, knowledge, creativity, risk-taking, multi-skilledness, and readiness to adjust to new changes, especially technology-driven ones.\n\nI have witnessed the workplace evolution of aspirations from just being a good salary to the new \u2018normal\u2019. Gen Z is looking for a flexible work programme, opportunities to grow within the organisation, transparency in communication, diversity, and inclusion, and is considering how the work environment will affect their mental health.\n\nIn my experience as an HR practitioner, I have adjusted to accommodate Gen Z demands. This is an extremely impatient lot, but they are smart, hardworking, and risk-takers with a knack for perfection. This is a group of people who prefer instant feedback as opposed to an end-of-review set period for appraisal to take place.\n\nI have learned the importance of creating room for them to vent, speak their mind, and, if possible, have a one-on-one conversation aimed not at criticising but at implementing solutions. As a human relations professional, help employees connect their strengths to their work by providing training and development opportunities.\n\nWhat about Gen Z\u2019s level of engagement and the need for constant attention, fuelled partly by social media? Well, ensure that the expectations for the outcome are clear at the beginning of the contract and have regular checks in, if possible, monthly.\n\nGen Z employees want to feel safe, valued, and productive. It is about creating an environment where employees use their strengths every day. By embracing these changes and understanding Gen Z\u2019s values, businesses can position themselves for future success.\n\nCommunicate clearly and on time if there are any changes, allow room for creativity in the process of delivering work and finally ensure that you have supplied tools necessary to deliver work.",

        "body": "Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Kamau Thugge spoke to the Business Daily recently in the backdrop of his first year in office. The interview covered many subjects under his mandate, including foreign exchange, monetary policy, currencies, and the banking industry.\n\nYou had made the tough choice between raising domestic interest rates and cushioning the exchange rate with an adjustment to the benchmark lending rate, has this been the right course of action?\n\nIn a sense, it\u2019s choosing your poison. In my view, you need to deal with inflation and anchor inflation expectations, because if you don\u2019t, if inflation becomes something you can\u2019t control it affects the entire economy and ultimately, banks will not have negative real interest rates.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t push up interest rates and allow inflation to go to 30 percent, no bank will lend to you at less than 30 percent, so you will still have higher interest rates.\n\nAre we now at equilibrium with the shilling or at least close to it?\n\nRight now, there are significant foreign inflows but who knows\u2026for the time being we see stability and we don\u2019t interfere unless it\u2019s a sharp appreciation or depreciation. Broadly we allow the market to tell us what the equilibrium rate would be and so I wouldn\u2019t say whether we are at this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in core capital will trigger amalgamation in the industry, especially for banks unable to raise the higher Sh10 billion capital, will we see you forcing marriages between banks?\n\nI think we will allow it to play out between the banks and you know we have a microfinance sector. If you can\u2019t generate enough capital, it doesn\u2019t mean you shut down. Unless asked to be intermediate, I wouldn\u2019t see the need to force mergers.\n\nThere is a fear of creating concentration risks where you have big banks swallowing up everyone, Is this farfetched for you?\n\nI think we will still have quite a few banks, I don\u2019t think the issue of concentration is a concern. For purposes of competitiveness, having bigger banks enhances competitiveness. Right now when you have just a few big banks, they set the stage so to speak, and then the smaller banks just follow. Having bigger and more competitive banks will help us even lower interest rates.\n\nThere has been a push for an expanded mandate for the CBK in terms of the regulation of entities, do you feel the bank can take on more?\n\nWe have submitted some amendments to the Act to move away from digital credit to just credit because a lot of these credit providers are not always on digital platforms.\n\nYour predecessor was somewhat hands-off in terms of engaging stakeholders like banks, is your approach as a regulator different?\n\nMine is somewhat different, I have tried to engage the stakeholders as much as possible and we have had regular meetings with bank CEOs and their heads of treasuries.\n\nThey were part of resolving the exchange rate problem. I wouldn\u2019t want the hands-off approach, but that\u2019s not to suggest that we won\u2019t be very hard on them if they don\u2019t comply.\n\nOne of the first observations I made is that there seemed to be a number who were not complying because the penalties were so low. The penalties we are bringing on board will bring sanity, where banks will think twice before violating any CBK provisions.\n\nWhere do we stand today on the creation of a central bank digital currency?\n\nThe main conclusion was that given where we are in terms of financial inclusion, where we are quite ahead of others in terms of digital payments, going to a central bank for digital currency was not a priority, and this stand remains. Having said that, however, we need to keep up with what\u2019s going on in that space.\n\nLast year, CBK indicated it had no demand for new notes and coins, and we saw De la Rue pausing its business subsequently. Some might tell you they haven\u2019t seen any new notes around, has that demand returned?\n\nIf you look at currency in circulation, relative to gross domestic product, Kenya\u2019s is very low compared to countries like India. There will always be a need for some currency, but at the same time, there are developments in digital payments that continue to reduce the need for new currency. There will always be a need, but that need will keep reducing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should we expect more of from the CBK going into your second year in office?\n\nI\u2019ll take you back to the mandate, and the first is price stability. I think going forward we would like to maintain that, and we have already modernised our monetary framework.\n\nSecond is the stability of the financial system\u2014my vision is to have that stability\u2014fewer but stronger banks, which will not just come from a regional perspective.",

        "body": "The value of foreign currency loans and deposits held in local banks fell by Sh504.9 billion in three months ended March on the backdrop of a strengthening Kenya shilling, easing concerns about the lenders\u2019 exposure to external risks.\n\nDeposits in foreign currency fell sharply in the period, dropping to Sh1.63 trillion from Sh1.91 trillion in December 2023 as gains in local currency depleted the holdings of offshore notes in Kenya shilling terms.\n\nForeign currency loans equally fell, touching Sh990.2 billion from Sh1.21 trillion at the end of 2023.\n\nThe fall in foreign currency loans and deposits is a relief to banks after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of high exposure.\n\n\u201cThe share of FX (foreign currency) loans declined somewhat in the third quarter of 2023 but remained higher than a year ago. Currently, an unremunerated cash reserve ratio of 4.25 percent applies to a bank\u2019s total domestic and FX deposit liabilities and is filled in shilling. There are no additional capital requirements on FX loans or exposure caps on FX loans,\u201d the IMF observed in a January report.\n\nThe share of Kenya\u2019s total foreign currency liabilities stood at 34.9 percent as of September 2023, beating the median of 31.6 percent for emerging and developing economies.\n\nThe IMF observed that foreign currency deposits were on the increase even after factoring in the depreciation of the exchange rate, which signalled a nominal increase in hard currency holdings across 2023.\n\nThe accumulation was attributable to banks increasing their ownership of foreign currency to service the government-to-government oil importation deal that started in March 2023 and to expectations of the continued depreciation of the Kenya shilling.\n\nThe multilateral lender underlined risks, including foreign currency access difficulties, in its caution against accumulating hard currency credit, particularly for foreign currency loans.\n\n\u201cA non-trivial portion of the FX loans are in sectors such as personal loans, real estate, transport and communication, and building and construction; it\u2019s unclear to what extent borrowers in these sectors have a natural hedge as these sectors are not main export sectors,\u201d the IMF added.\n\n\u201cBanks report that with the ongoing dollar shortage, FX borrowers who are unable to source for US dollars in the local market have been offering repayment in shilling, effectively defaulting on the loans and contributing to the rise in non-performing loans.\n\nFirms and businesses had resorted to contracting hard currency loans to access dollars amid the foreign exchange crisis observed across 2023.\n\nForeign currency liquidity has, however, improved through 2024 following reforms and interventions to halt the depreciation of the Kenya shilling, which have encouraged new inflows of hard currency into the economy.\n\nThe Kenyan shilling has been a gainer against major world currencies including the US dollar since mid-February and is part of the best-performing currencies in the world this year.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya quoted the local unit at Sh128.7 against the US dollar on Tuesday, representing gains of over 19 percent for the shilling on a year-to-date basis.",

The fertiliser subsidy programme was top of President William Ruto\u2019s agenda when he took power in September 2022 at a time the country was battling record-high maize prices.\n\nThis was largely due to a biting drought, said to be the worst in four decades, in 2022 and disruption in global supply chains that followed Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, pushing up the global prices of fertiliser to record levels.\n\nThe government cushion on prices helped cut the cost for a 50-kilogramme bag of subsidized fertiliser from highs of Sh6,500 to Sh3,500 initially before falling to current levels of Sh2,500.\n\n\u201cIn order to support agricultural production, the Government rolled out a countrywide farmer registration and fertiliser subsidy programme that has made available 5.5 million bags to farmers across Kenya,\u201d Treasury wrote in the 2024 Budget Policy Statement (BPS).",

        "body": "Airtel Uganda\u2019s majority shareholder Airtel Africa is set to sell additional shares amounting to a 9.11 percent stake in a secondary offer to comply with a requirement to offload a minimum ownership of 20 percent to minority investors trading on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE).\n\nThe multinational in November 2023 managed to sell 4.35 billion shares equivalent to a 10.89 percent stake in Airtel Uganda\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) that was open to domestic and foreign investors including Kenyans, failing to meet the ownership rule.\n\nAirtel Africa says in its latest annual report that it received a regulatory extension to sell the balance of 3.64 billion shares by November 2026, a move that will see it replicate the moves by MTN Group, which successfully offloaded a 20 percent stake in MTN Uganda in two transactions including a secondary offer concluded last month.\n\n\u201cOn November 7, 2023, Airtel Uganda listed 10.89 percent of its shares on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) in compliance with Uganda Communications (Fees and Fines) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, which created an obligation for all national telecom operator licensees to list 20 percent of their shares on the USE,\u201d Airtel Africa says in the report.\n\n\u201cThe USE granted Airtel Uganda an extension until 6 November 2026 to offer the shortfall to achieve the 20 percent listing.\u201d\n\nAirtel Africa sold its shares at a price of UGX100 (Sh3.47) each in the IPO that also offered incentive shares on a band of subscription volumes to attract investors. Retail investors who applied for more than 2,500 shares, for instance, received 10 free shares for each 100 shares allocated. Institutional investors who applied for at least 1.85 billion shares were offered 112 free shares for each 100 shares allocated.\n\nDespite the incentive shares, which amounted to a discount on the offer price, the IPO only managed a subscription rate of 54.45 percent in a transaction that saw Uganda\u2019s National Social Security Fund (NSSF) take up about 97 percent of the allocated shares.\n\nThe below par performance of the telco\u2019s IPO was partly attributed to exclusion of Airtel Money which is owned separately by Airtel Africa and a group of other institutional investors. MTN Uganda offered both its mobile money and telecommunications businesses to the investing public.\n\nAirtel Uganda\u2019s share price has declined post-IPO to trade at Ush70 (Sh2.45), indicating that its parent firm could offer deeper discounts to meet local ownership requirement in the impending secondary offer.\n\nAirtel Uganda, which offers data, SMS and voice services, has a policy of distributing at least 95 percent of net income as dividends.\n\nMTN Group sold an extra 7.03 percent stake in MTN Uganda\u2019s oversubscribed secondary offer last month, cutting its ownership in the subsidiary to 80 percent. It sold 1.57 billion shares at a price of Ush170 (Sh5.9) each in the transaction that featured incentive shares.\n\nThis was a larger discount compared to MTN Uganda\u2019s November 2021 IPO in which the multinational sold a 12.97 percent stake at a price of Ush200 (Sh6.95) per share while also offering incentive shares.\n\nPricing of the secondary offer took into account a drop in the share price of MTN Uganda, which currently stands at Ush170 (Sh5.9). The sale of MTN Uganda shares was open to Ugandan and foreign investors.\n\nMTN Uganda\u2019s successful secondary offer was also helped by extension of the book closure date for its final dividend of Ush6.4 (Sh0.22) per share from June 4 to June 12. This enabled investors who participated in the offer to qualify for the payout. The offer closed on June 10.\n\nMTN Uganda, which aims to pay out at least 60 percent of profits as dividends, has attracted notable Kenyan investors including billionaire Baloobhai Patel, Central Bank of Kenya and the National Social Security Fund.",

In March last year the lender issued an alert over an impending closure of its operations in three East African markets\u2014 Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania\u2014this year over worsening conditions.\n\nIt classified the three regions (Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania) including Ghana and Nigeria as \u2018turnaround markets\u2019 which are currently unfit for growth and appointed a turnaround master Fergus Ferguson, the former Chief Executive of Botswana with oversight over Eswatini and Lesotho (Boleswa), as the regional CEO to oversee their recovery in 10 months, failure to which a closure decision will be made this year to avoid further financial bleeding.",

        "body": "From the latest anecdotal evidence I have gathered, indications are that all is not well with the Affordable Housing Project which is touted as President William Ruto administration\u2019s biggest signature project.\n\nCurrently, a major controversy has erupted between the bureaucracy in charge of the project and a group of 33 consultants-mainly architects and quantity surveyors- over delayed payments.\n\nLast week, and with the financial year coming to a close, expectations were high that the consultants would be paid during the traditional end of fiscal year scramble when ministries rush to clear payments lest monies be returned to the Exchequer. A meeting called at a Nairobi hotel on Friday with the consultants resolved the dispute.\n\nIt is not a god sign because in view of the scope of this giant project, maintaining the support from the community and fraternity of consultants is critical to delivery and success.\n\nFrom what I have gathered from private conversations with the players in this space, it seems decision- making is impeded by lack of clear lines of command within the bureaucracy running the project.\n\nHolding an office is not the same thing as being in power. Cabinet Secretary Alice Wahome holds a big office and so does the Principal Secretary, Charles Hinga. But from my reading when I map the play of effective power and decision- making is that Housing Secretary, Said Athman, is also a very powerful player.\n\nClearly, rolling out this project is going to be the biggest test on President Ruto administration\u2019s capacity to successfully roll out large infrastructure projects. It reminds me of Francis Fukuyama\u2019s writings on the concept of State capacity, described as the ability of a government to deliver large infrastructure projects on time.\n\nWithin the region, the government of Ethiopia is regarded as having a better record at delivering projects on time and within budget. Does it surprise that we have contracted the Ethiopians to sell to us a lot of electricity from its dams? Even little Rwanda is rated higher than us in terms of capacity to implement large infrastructure in time and at cost.\n\nWe went into this massive affordable housing project without thinking through it properly and before agreeing on the feasible model. Clearly, the government has been involved in miss and hit experimentation.\n\nWhen it started, the model was based on an invitation to private sector to \u2018design, finance, build and transfer\u2019 affordable houses at fixed price of Sh50,000 per square metre on the guarantee of an off-taker. The government would buy all the units on completion. Indeed, the most attractive aspects of the programme was free land and the off-taker guarantee.\n\nThe next stage was to provide a proof of concept. This was achieved after President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s administration contracted the Chinese group, China State Corporation- who built and completed 1,300 affordable housing units in the Park Road area in Ngara, Nairobi.\n\nWith the concept having been approved, the Ministry of Lands and Housing went on a spree of advertising free land sites. I have lost count of the number of newspaper adverts put up by Mr Hinga to offer free land to developers in different parts of the country.\n\nAt some point, the model was suddenly changed from \u2018design, finance, build, and transfer\u2019 to a \u2018development split\u2019 model whereby the government would only guarantee off-take of 70 percent of the units, with the developer allowed to sell the remaining units at market rates.\n\nWith the change of model- and without an off-taker guarantee, the developers dried up. The second round of the project covering Starehe, and Shauri Moyo in Nairobi was hit by inadequate investor appetite. As a matter of fact, one developer walked away. The collapse of the housing levy bill was a big factor.\n\nIn January 2022, 59 sites throughout the country were advertised. Only Kingdom Developers and Gulf showed up. After the General Elections, Mr Hinga advertised 70 additional sites- including land belonging to the Kenya Police and Kenya Defence Forces. There was even a time when university student\u2019s halls were brought on board. Still, no serious takers.\n\nWith the advent of President Ruto\u2019s administration, the model changed again because-this time around- the housing levy had been enacted. The government now became the designer. All that was needed was to engage construction companies.\n\nAlthough the response to offers was very good, the bids were way higher than the fixed price of Sh50,000 per square metre. Consultants had to be brought in to review the designs. They have not been paid.",

        "body": "The information and communication sector posted a 7.8 percent growth in the first quarter of 2024, down from 9.5 percent the previous year, marking its first slowdown in growth since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nData from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows that the sector has been on a consistently accelerated year-on-year rise since March 2021 when growth stood at 5.1 percent before rising to 8.1 percent during a similar period in 2022.\n\nThe slowdown in ICT growth mirrors an overall sluggish growth in all other economic sectors in the review period except banking. Kenya\u2019s economy grew at a slower pace of five percent in the first three months of 2024 compared to 5.5 percent in the same period last year, in a period when the business environment was roiled by high interest rates.\n\nKNBS data shows that all the sectors, save for finance and insurance activities, recorded slower growth in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2023 pointing to a tough macro-economic environment.\n\nICT services are a catalytic backward and forward linkages across all other commercial segments and a slowdown in the sector gives a pulse on the state of the economy. For example, it supports financial services in aspects such as money transfers, e-commerce at nascent stages, improved public service in the case of e-government as well as human capital development through e-learning.\n\nThe deceleration comes despite aggressive State efforts to spur a national digital revolution through a raft of infrastructural and skill-development programmes.\n\nAmong the ongoing projects include the five-year scheme to lay down at least 100,000 kilometres of the national fiber optic cable, setting up 25,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots in major markets and trading centres across the country as well as establishing a digital hub in each of Kenya\u2019s 1,450 wards.\n\nThe ICT sector gained massive traction in the wake of the Covid crisis as the population shifted en masse from in-person interactions as part of government-backed measures aimed at containing the spread of the deadly virus.\n\nThe pandemic, for instance, propelled the enhanced provision of an array of services in computing and communication as witnessed through the surge in demand for fixed internet as people heeded to government calls to work from home as well as schools adopting e-learning.\n\nSince then, Kenya has continued to report significant progress in the digital transformation space at the global level with novel breakthroughs ranging from innovations in real-time data collection and management, to cybersecurity support systems as well as big data management.",

        "body": "Amid heated protests in the country against the new proposed taxes that have now been dropped, a new survey has found that a vast majority of Kenyans would be okay with the government introducing taxes that target only the rich.\n\nThe survey done by research firm Ipsos, and commissioned by economic think tank Earth4All, reveals that 76 percent of Kenyans would support a higher income tax rate on wealthy people, and 70 percent strongly agree that the rich should pay a tax on their wealth.\n\nA majority of Kenyans, about 81 percent, would also support a proposal to have large businesses pay a higher tax rate, and 76 percent would like the State to tax companies and individuals polluting the environment, the study published last week shows.\n\nIpsos surveyed 1,000 Kenyans between March 5 and April 8, 2024, for the research.\n\nAccording to the study, which was conducted in 18 G20 countries including Kenya, most locals who support taxing the wealthy view it as an effective means of redistributing income in a country characterised by a huge inequality gap.\n\nAlmost nine in 10 Kenyans (84 percent) believe that there\u2019s \u201ctoo much economic inequality\u201d in the country these days, and only 37 percent believe in the capitalistic notion that everyone will be better off if only a few people get richer.\n\nAs such, Kenyans would like the additional tax income raised from the wealth taxes to be used in economically equalising the country, with about 65 percent saying the government should give every Kenyan a universal basic income (UBI), and 86 percent saying citizens should have access to free or affordable healthcare.\n\nCompared to South Africa, the only other country on the continent surveyed among the 21, Kenyans show a stronger support for wealth taxes and their utilisation in redistribution of income.\n\nIn South Africa, 71 percent support a higher income tax on the wealthy, compared to Kenya\u2019s 76 percent, and 74 percent would have large businesses pay a higher tax, compared to Kenya\u2019s 81 percent.\n\nSupport for wealth taxes is highest in Indonesia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, where up to 86 percent of the citizens believe the government should impose a tax on wealth for richer citizens.\n\nKenya currently has few taxes directly on wealth. The closest similarity to a wealth tax in the country is the land rates, whose collection is relatively lower than other jurisdictions around the globe, and the Capital Gains Tax, which was last year raised from five percent to 10 percent. This is charged on the gains from disposal of an asset.\n\nStill, it appears Kenyans would like more taxes targeting only the wealthy and high-income earners.\n\nPresident William Ruto had alluded to the introduction of new wealth taxes at the onset of his administration in September 2022, when he told lawmakers that Kenya taxes trade more and wealth less.",

Five of their planes are currently grounded at JKIA because they have not been able to get engine parts to run them,\u201d said a source in the industry.\n\nThe five planes currently stuck at JKIA without engine parts to run them are a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, two Embraer E-190s and two Boeing 737-300s.\n\nA Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner operates on long-haul routes while an Embraer E-190 operates short-haul and medium routes. Boeing 737-300 aircraft operates medium haul routes.\n\nThe airline\u2019s officials had not responded to our query by the time of going to press.\n\nOn June 30 alone, at least 16 flights were either cancelled or delayed.\n\nThis includes KQ604, KQ608 and KQ618 to Mombasa, which were canceled. KQ270 to Mauritius was cancelled while KQ886 to Bangkok was delayed by eight hours and 50 minutes. On July 1, 2024, several flights were affected too. This includes flight KQ362 to Mogadishu and flight KQ 594 to Douala.\n\nThe national carrier has grappled with inadequate staffing and equipment in the wake of the global travel's recovery from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic that broke out in early 2020.\n\nKenya Airways had let go of some of its employees in 2020 to cut costs due to depressed earnings caused by the pandemic but has been hiring more in the past few years.\n\nThe airline is under pressure to deploy more crew members and aircraft to service routes that were idle during the Covid-19 period.\n\nThe country is also staring at a peak tourism season, which started early this month. The airline currently flies to 45 destinations and faces stiff competition, not just from major players like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines, but from African carriers as well.\n\nThe government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is the biggest regional threat and flies to more than 120 destinations.\n\nBoth Uganda and Tanzania have poured cash into their flag carriers in the past three years, joining countries such as Rwanda and Togo, which have also ramped up investment in their own carriers.",

        "body": "The manufacturing sector posted the slowest growth in 16 years in the first three months of 2024, spooked by high production costs and a recent barrage of tax measures, dealing a blow to prospects of generating quality jobs in the economy.\n\nData by the Kenya National Bureau of Standards (Kebs) show that the sector grew by 1.3 percent in the quarter to March compared to 1.7 percent a year prior - the slowest pace since the same quarter of 2008 when it grew by a paltry 0.7 percent amid deadly violence and economic disruption caused by the disputed outcome of the 2007 presidential election.\n\n\u201cGrowth in the manufacture of food products was constrained by a 6.5 percent decline in soft drink production during the quarter under review. In the manufacture of non-food products, cement production declined from 2.3 million tonnes in the same quarter of 2023 to 2.1 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2024,\u201d KNBS stated in its GDP report for the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe poor growth performance leaves the sector-- which has the highest multiplier effect on the economy-- on the ropes despite being touted as a key pillar of the Kenya Kwanza administration, which sees industry driving the next phase of Kenya\u2019s economic transformation.\n\nThe slump in manufacturing puts a damper on the government's ambitions of raising the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP to 20 percent by 2030 as productivity falls. Local manufacturers, who are members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), have set the same target under their \u201820by30\u2019 agenda.\n\nThe share of manufacturing to Kenya\u2019s GDP stood at 7.6 percent in 2023 in contrast to a high of 10 percent in 2014. The sector also contributed just 9,700 of the 848,100 new jobs created in the economy in 2023 or 1.14 percent.\n\nIndustrialists cite a recent wave of punitive tax measures and high costs of production for the dismal performance in the sector.\n\nFor example, the export and promotion levy introduced through the Finance Act, 2023 set a tax of 17.5 percent of the customs value of imported cement clinkers and other manufacturing-related products such as bars and rods, impacting the cost of finished products from local manufacturers.\n\nOnly Bamburi Cement, Mombasa Cement, and Simba Cement manufacture clinker locally, according to KAM, highlighting constrained productivity by other cement makers on higher input costs.\n\n\u201cBecause of that constrained production, the capacity to manufacture cement has gone down while the cost of a bag of cement has risen from lows of Sh560 to upwards of Sh850 in some places. This has impacted other sectors such as construction and real estate,\u201d noted KAM CEO Anthony Mwangi.\n\nThe new taxes have exacerbated the struggles of a sector already bogged down by high production costs, including that of imports and electricity.\n\nCostly energy is being blamed on inefficiencies in generation, transmission, and distribution. Mr Mwangi said manufacturing has been shaken on both the demand and supply side, inhibiting gains for sector expected to carry the multiplier effect in the economy, including job creation.\n\n\u201cWe operate in an ecosystem and just looking at the overall economic environment, you look at interest rates going up, so has the cost of living which has hit the demand for manufactured products by consumers. On the supply side, we face high input costs including energy, taxes, and regulatory levies paid to entities such as Kebs [Kenya Bureau of Standards] and Nema [National Environment Management Authority] alongside the cost and tenure of credit. Everywhere you turn, costs come at you,\u201d he added.\n\nThe problems bedevilling manufacturing, according to KAM, include trade in counterfeit products, transport and storage issues, and weak access to credit financing.\n\nUnder its Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), President William Ruto identified key value chains, including leather, textiles, dairy, edible oils, building and construction materials, as important in efforts to boost manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP.\n\nKey allocations to the sector in the fiscal year ended June 30 included Sh4.7 billion for the establishment of county-integrated agro-industrial parks and Sh550 million for the completion of the Naivasha Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and the construction of Dongo Kundu SEZ.\n\nA further Sh2.8 billion was set aside for the development of the Athi River Textile Hub and Sh3 billion for six EPZ flagship hubs.\n\nIn January, the government revealed it would be putting up 30 additional county aggregation and industrial parks, lifting the number from an initial 18.\n\nThe push for new manufacturing infrastructure has come against the continued erosion of existing factories as industrial areas now face encroachment from entertainment spots after the barrage of residential houses.\n\nKAM, while acknowledging the drag on activity from the recent anti-tax protests in the country, sees the opportunity to overhaul government policies in the face of public discourse, resetting manufacturing back to the growth path.",
        "summary": "The manufacturing sector posted the slowest growth in 16 years in the first three months of 2024, spooked by high production costs and a recent barrage of tax measures, dealing a blow to prospects of generating quality jobs in the economy.\n\u201cGrowth in the manufacture of food products was constrained by a 6.5 percent decline in soft drink production during the quarter under review.\nIndustrialists cite a recent wave of punitive tax measures and high costs of production for the dismal performance in the sector.\nOnly Bamburi Cement, Mombasa Cement, and Simba Cement manufacture clinker locally, according to KAM, highlighting constrained productivity by other cement makers on higher input costs.\nThe new taxes have exacerbated the struggles of a sector already bogged down by high production costs, including that of imports and electricity.",

        "body": "Teaching 10-year olds how to stage a full scale theatre production might not sound like an easy affair, especially when you are talking about teaching musical theatre to more than 100 children who signed up for the theatre class taught by Joan Aywaya and Warucu Kijuu.\n\nBut on June 21, 2024, we saw how these two teachers took a hands-on approach by staging the award-winning musical, Matilda the Musical, at Brookhouse School in Karen. One of the few schools in Kenya where theatre is one of the core courses in the curriculum.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019d asked our students if they had any preferred play to stage, nearly all of them said they wanted Matilda,\u201d Joan told the BDLife right after the Friday evening show.\n\nIn the programme (which most theatre companies today don\u2019t bother to create anymore) the two teachers (turned into co-directors for their annual productions) wrote a synopsis which clarified how the musical is based on the beloved children\u2019s book by Roald Dahl about Matilda Wormwood.\n\nMatilda is a bit like Harry Potter who\u2019d lived with abusive elders, only Matilda\u2019s adults were actually her parents whereas Harry\u2019s elders are related to his magical deceased mom. Even Cinderella\u2019s story follows a similar storyline of neglect, child abuse, and jealousy fueling the nasty treatment of our morally superior hero and heroines.\n\nThe synopsis doesn\u2019t make comparisons between Matilda, Harry, and Cinderella, but it does note that Matilda isn\u2019t alone in being abused at school. Her fellow classmates also get physically beaten (corporal punishment) by the \u2018tyrannical Head Mistress, Miss Trunchbuli who hates children and runs Crunchem Hall with an iron fist.\u201d\n\nOne of Matilda\u2019s biggest deprivations is the lack of books in her home (her parents refuse to buy them for her). Her biggest blessing is meeting the school\u2019s kind and carrying Miss Honey who recognises Matilda\u2019s keen intelligence, curiosity, and delight in finding a place where she can read books to her heart\u2019s content.\n\nMiss Honey is also mistreated by Trenchbuli. Witnessing these injustices finally inspires Matilda to stand up to the tyrannical head teacher who was ultimately tamed by \u2018a touch of magic\u2019, humility, and intelligence.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too difficult to see how easily such a heart-warming story as Matilda could be understood by 10, 11, and 12-year-olds. But getting the pre-teens to understand all the nitty-gritty of staging a musical production might not be as simple. Nonetheless, putting that challenge is what the BDLife saw coming to life in Brookhouse\u2019s weekend show.\n\nJust sitting down with the cast and stage crew enabled students to see and learn how really good directors can behave. And when the directors are also helping their students understand the meanings behind the words, lines, and lyrics that they will sing, dance, and narrate, is even better.\n\nIt meant that teachers Joyce and Warucu were illustrating other aspects of effective directing. Some cast members may have already been involved with theatre through their churches so they too know how challenging learning lines can be, but that too is part of the teachers\u2019 task, to not only memorise their lines but also understand the meaning of those lines.\n\nIn a few cases, as the BDLife watched this fun production, it was easy to tell that not everyone spoke their lines with conviction although they knew their timing and kept their line up as in their chorus line. But when those few who didn\u2019t understand the significance of their lines charged swiftly through them, it wasn\u2019t always easy to hear what they had to say.\n\nNonetheless, it definitely didn\u2019t look difficult teaching students the joys of dancing, singing, and moving together as a giant ensemble or chorus line. In fact, the choreography was so good, I had to ask who the choreographer was since he or she wasn\u2019t mentioned in the programme.\n\nNormally, students who want to become professional thespians go to a college or university to learn all the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of musical theatre, including set design, costuming, lighting, sound, and even makeup artistry.",

        "body": "Adam Masava and Andew \u2018Crae\u2019 Chege are like birds of a feather despite their coming from very different backgrounds.\n\nOne comes from a comfortable Christian home outside Ruiru, Kiambu. The other was born and raised in Mukuru, a part of town not nearly so secure as Crae\u2019s. Yet the two are united in their love of art which transcends the material differences of class and culture, race and tribe, and even gender and age.\n\nCrae and Adam met at one exhibition opening. Crae started spending time at Mukuru Art with Adam, even as he was nearly finished being a fourth year student in the Fine Art department at Kenyatta University (KU).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I got my Bachelor [of Arts from KU], but I\u2019ve learned so much from Adam, especially about how to be a professional artist, stuff I wasn\u2019t taught at KU,\u201d Crae tells the BDLife.\n\nAnthony Chege\u2019s \u2018Desired Destiny\u2019 (left) and 'Boat analytical Transformation' at the Village Market rooftop gallery on June 15, 2024. Photo credit: Margaretta wa Gacheru | Nation Media Group\n\n\u201cKU took a more academic approach to art so I learned a lot about different materials and techniques of painting, but not about making art a professional career, which is invaluable stuff,\u201d he added.\n\nAdam himself wasn\u2019t at the Vibrant Hues exhibition at the Village Market rooftop since he had other shows popping up in various places around Europe. \u201cWe had been planning on having this exhibition for a long time, but when we were finally able to secure the gallery, we\u2019d still have to wait a year,\u201d Crea explained.\n\nBut Adam had mapped out his side of the exhibition well before he went overseas. Plus he had several of his most dedicated students looking after all aspects of the show, from surveillance and sakes to curatorial and administrative aspects of the exhibition. Several were even given a corner of the gallery to show their work.\n\nThere are several other things that Adam and Crea have in common. One is an attention to perspective and ways of enhancing different vantage points with different materials. Adam does it using different kinds of variegated cardboard to illustrate a more three dimensional view of Kibera\u2019s mabati rooftops, some in the foreground of the work, others behind crafted with a sort of flatter cardboard meant to be further background.\n\nCrae used to paint scenes in the slums somewhat similar to Masava\u2019s, only he didn\u2019t work with anything but acrylic on canvas, that is, until recently when he started painting on glass, or rather, the glass-like plastic called Plexiglas.\n\nBut not just one plate per painting. Let\u2019s talk about four plates per painting on which Crae paints on both sides of one plate. So for one painting, Crae uses four plates of flexiglass to create eight different paintings. It might be difficult to imagine how four plates of \u2018glass\u2019 can hang together well, particularly when the four are stacked and then sealed tight.\n\nIt\u2019s rather like what silkscreen artists do when they are printing several colours, one precisely on top of the other so that the finished picture is intact with the colours laid out just as the artist intended.\n\nCrae has half a wall filled with monochrome cityscapes that display his skill as a draftsman drawing assorted areas of Eastlands and urban life. So when we had gotten round to the far end of the show and saw his \u2018Desirable Destiny\u2019 we were taken aback. This was definitely a new Crae.",

        "body": "To extend last week\u2019s article on hedging, today, I highlight why certain non-financial firms (read: commodity exporters, importers) need to develop a corporate hedging policy. As more and more companies suffer the consequences of being unhedged, having such a policy is becoming vital. I highlight the three pillars in building one.\n\nThe first pillar is a clear articulation of the firm\u2019s hedging objectives. These should be directly tied to the company\u2019s broader financial goals such as stabilising cash flows, hedging against short-term commodity price increases, managing foreign exchange risks or \u201clocking-in\u201d profit margins.\n\nSecond pillar involves defining the who and what of the policy. Who is responsible for the hedging policy? Who is going to be responsible for ensuring that the company adheres to policy? Who is responsible for developing, implementing and managing the hedging policy and accompanying strategies and procedures? A hedge committee, chief accountant, risk manager, etc.?\n\nWho is responsible for selecting appropriate counterparties and/or derivatives brokers/clearing members and what criteria will be used to evaluate them? And who is responsible for continuous monitoring and risk reporting?\n\nWhat type of transactions will be permitted? Forwards, futures, swaps, options? What indices will be permitted i.e. Dubai/Oman crude oil, ICE Coffee Futures, Singapore jet fuel, etc.? What resources (manpower, risk management systems, commodity market data, etc.) will said individuals and/or teams need to properly carry out their responsibilities? For example, the effectiveness of risk management metrics, such as stress testing, is essential for assessing the degree of vulnerability of the business under extreme conditions like a pandemic.\n\nIf the market trends unfavourably against the hedged exposure and the derivative fails to fulfil its hedging requirements (that is, does not offset the anticipated losses of the hedged exposure) or the chosen structure proves faulty as highlighted in my previous article on KQ, the primary purpose of the hedge is undermined. This situation could result in increased risk and a higher utilisation of the company\u2019s credit lines.\n\nThe third pillar deals with the practical aspects of executing derivative trades or the why, when and how. When and how will existing positions be reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate given the company's risk tolerance, hedging policy and current market conditions? When and how will the various risks (market, credit, operational, regulatory) be measured and by whom? When and why will transactions be executed?\n\nHow often should the policy be reviewed and by whom? This is to guarantee that the company consistently aligns with its core hedging objectives and does not deviate from them.\n\nClearly there are a lot of issues to be explored when developing a hedging policy but by adhering to the three core pillars outlined above, companies can ensure that their use of derivatives is prudent, purposeful and perfectly tailored to their specific needs.\n\nA well-designed hedging plan will cut both risks and costs. Additionally, it allows management to focus on aspects of the firm in which it has a competitive edge by minimising risks that are not central to the core business.",

        "title": "Pop star Celine Dion chronicles her journey to stardom and declining health",
        "body": "There are few music pop stars in the world with the clout of Celine Dion. For more than three decades the Canadian singer has charmed the world with power ballads that are romantic signature tunes among the young and old, across the globe.\n\nThat is why her announcement in December 2022 that she was putting her career on hold after being diagnosed with Stiff Person\u2019s Syndrome (SPS) was greeted with shock and disbelief among adoring fans. The disease is a rare neurological disorder that affects one or two people in a million, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. It causes fluctuating muscle rigidity that can manifest in muscle spasms and falls.\n\nThe story of the 56-year-old superstar\u2019s battle against the condition is chronicled in the new documentary I Am Celine Dion which premiered on Prime Video on June 25, 2024.\n\n\u201cBefore I got hit by SPS my voice was the conductor of my life,\u201d she says with a smirk. \u201cI was following it, \u2018you lead the way, I\u2019ll follow you,\u2019\u201d she explains while gesturing as if to sing.\n\nThe film, directed by Irene Taylor, the Oscar nominated US filmmaker who admits that she hardly knew anything about Dion before this project, is an intimate portrayal of the singer, her family life and the rehabilitation from effects of her illness.\n\nIn a departure from the typical documentary format, the film relies exclusively on Dion to tell her own story, without accompanying talking heads. It traces her childhood love for music through grainy family home videos as she recalls signing in the kitchen at age 5 for her audience comprising her 13 brothers and sisters in a little town in Quebec.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be an international star and sing all my life,\u201d she states in one of those childhood videos.\n\nThat shy girl with a distinctly powerful voice has risen to become a global icon over the course of 27 albums, selling 250 million records, winning five Grammy Awards and two Academy Awards. But that extraordinary success has come against the background of severe health challenges going back further than her public announcement last year.\n\n\u201cSeventeen years ago, I started experiencing voice spasms. I woke up and had breakfast and after breakfast my voice started to go up,\u201d she reveals. \u201cWhen I try to breathe, my lungs are OK, it is what is in front of my lungs that is so rigid because of SPS.\u201d\n\nShe dealt with that condition by pumping a variety of medicines into her system, 280-290 milligrammes of valium a day, according to her, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic but I could have died,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI needed medicine to function. One more pill, two more pills, five more pills, too many pills.\u201d She had to explain to her fans why her shows were getting cancelled and also deal with rampant rumors about her gaunt appearance.\n\nThe most emotionally draining scene is when Dion experiences a full-body attack with her body jerking in spasms in the middle of a physio therapy session as the cameras roll. Apparently after watching the rough cut of the documentary, she was adamant that that portion be retained to show the debilitating effects of SPS.\n\nMusically, the story is interspersed with archival footage of an exuberant Dion performing on stage in stark contrast to her frail physical condition during the making of the documentary.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in control of what I love to do, I could record three songs a night,\u201d she states. When you come in studio and you record, it sounds great, but when you go on stage it sounds greater because there is no mistake on stage, because there is humanity, bonding, emotions and when you forget your words, you panic for a second and out of the blue they (audience) start to sing.\u201d\n\nHer humorous side comes across whether showing off her massive collection of shoes and stage costumes or her famous \u201cbeat it, Spiderman\u201d retort at the end of the video for the song Ashes from the action film Deadpool 2.\n\nCeline Dion uses the metaphor of a fruit as she takes stock of her relationship with her fanbase: \u201cI am like an apple tree and people are in line and they all leave with a basket of apples. My branches are starting to fall sometime and those branches are starting to produce a little less apples but it still has many people in line.\u201d Then she concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t want them to wait in line if I don\u2019t have apples for them.\u201d",

        "body": "Retailers, construction firms, and farmers were the hardest-hit by the countrywide anti-government demos, which have paralysed business in major towns, findings of a closely watched survey have suggested.\n\nThe sectors bore the brunt of anxiety over new and higher tax proposals in the now-dropped Finance Bill 2024, with overall private sector sales falling at the steepest pace in seven months.\n\nThe youth-led anti-tax protests, which started a fortnight ago, have morphed into anti-government demos after President William Ruto conceded and declined to assent to the Bill, recommending that lawmakers delete all clauses.\n\nFindings of the Stanbic Kenya Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) \u2014 based on feedback from about 400 corporate managers in key sectors \u2014 suggested on Wednesday that customers \u201cwithheld spending decisions due to uncertainty around the country\u2019s finance bill\u201d.\n\nThat hurt output in all key sectors covered except manufacturing where respondents reported an uptick.\n\n\u201cAfter two months of increased purchasing activity by firms, there was a dip in purchasing quantities and inventories because of reduced sales in several sectors, namely construction, agriculture, wholesale, and retail,\u201d Christopher Legilisho, an economist with South African-based Standard Bank, the parent firm of Stanbic Bank, wrote in the PMI report for June.\n\n\u201cInput prices, purchase prices, and output prices recorded a mild increase in anticipation of the increased taxes proposed in the Finance Bill 2024. However, a stronger exchange rate and lower pump prices managed to restrain costs.\u201d\n\nOverall, June\u2019s PMI\u2014 a measure for month-on-month private sector activity such as output, new orders, and employment\u2014 fell at the sharpest pace in seven months to 47.2 from 51.8 in May.\n\nThe protests, which have been infiltrated by hired goons, resulted in near shutdowns in Kenya\u2019s four cities and major urban centres on days of demonstrations.\n\nThe now dropped new and higher taxation measures targeted to raise an extra Sh346 billion to fund a nearly Sh4 trillion budget for the year starting July.\n\nDr Ruto was banking on the new taxes and expenditure cuts largely targeting non-essential expenditures such as hospitality and renovation of offices as well as slashing allocations for semi-autonomous government agencies to place the country on the path to a balanced budget by 2027.\n\nA balanced budget will mean keeping borrowing at bare minimal levels, something the country has failed to achieve in the past, including Ruto\u2019s first full financial year in power ending this month.\n\nThe plan involved cutting the budget deficit from 5.7 per cent of gross domestic product, a measure of economic output, in the current financial year to 3.3 per cent of GDP in the financial year starting next month.\n\nThis was partly to comply with an IMF programme that requires Kenya to increase taxes as well as cut expenditures to keep the deficit in the budget to minimal levels.\n\n\u201cAfter registering a solid expansion midway through the quarter, private sector output dropped markedly in June, in line with a renewed and steep fall in new business intakes,\u201d analysts at Stanbic Bank and American analytics firm, S&P Global, said in the PMI report for June.\n\n\u201cAccording to panel members, tough economic conditions brought on by the cost-of-living crisis, as well as protests surrounding the country\u2019s finance bill hurt sales volumes.\u201d",

        "body": "Africa Oil Corp still has liabilities amounting to $1.8 million (Sh232,344,000) for its operations in Kenya and another claim of an unspecified amount from the local community a year after it exited the three oil blocks in Turkana oilfield.\n\nAfrica Oil, a Canadian oil and gas company, in a report to its shareholders for the first quarter of this year, put its \u201caccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d at $11.8 million down from $14.2 million in December last year relating to its exit from Blocks 10BB, 13T and 10 BA on June 30.\n\n\u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities mainly relate to liabilities, exit, and office close-down costs associated with the withdrawal from Kenya,\u201d said Africa Oil in its report to shareholders for March 2024.\n\nIts liability is likely to increase as the company discloses it has since been informed of another claim of an unspecified amount from the local community.\n\nAfter the exit of its subsidiary, Africa Oil Kenya BV, the parent company revealed in its half-year results for 2023 that it had settled Sh2.17 billion ($15.5 million) between April and June in 2023 to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and other undisclosed partners. The company says it is still awaiting the government\u2019s approval to transfer its interests and future obligations in the three oil blocks to British oil explorer Tullow Oil.\n\nUntil May 2023, the three blocks were owned jointly by Tullow Oil, which had a 50 percent stake, TotalEnergies (25 percent), and Africa Oil (25 percent).\n\nHowever, Africa Oil and TotalEnergies left the joint venture \u201cunequivocally and unconditionally\u201d raising doubts on the viability of a project the country had once staked its hopes of altering its economic fortunes by joining the oil-producing club.\n\nOn May 23 last year, Africa Oil announced its withdrawal from the entirety of the production sharing contracts and joint operating agreements for Blocks 10BB, 13T, and 10BA, and wrote to the Energy Ministry asking it to transfer all its rights and future obligations to the remaining joint venture partner, Tullow Oil.\n\nTullow, which now owns 100 percent of the blocks, has since informed Africa Oil of pending liability to the local community.\n\n\u201cThe company has been notified by the operator of the project about a claim made against the operator by local communities in relation to past operations which may relate to the period prior to June 30, 2023,\u201d said Africa Oil.\n\n\u201cThe company is currently in discussion with the operator and TotalEnergies to better understand the application and merits of this claim. No provision has been recognised for this as at March 31, 2024,\u201d it added.\n\nAfrica Oil ended its interest in the Turkana oil project in May, opting to concentrate in regions with high petroleum potential. It still has interests in Nigeria, South Africa, Equatorial Guinea and Namibia.\n\nAfrica Oil Kenya BV bought its stake in the Turkana oil project through the acquisition of exploration rights to Block 10BB from Turkana Energy Inc.\n\nThe exit of the Africa Oil and TotalEnergies has left the cash-strapped Tullow seeking a strategic investor to provide funds and help move the project to the commercialisation stage.\n\nOil blocks licensing\n\nThe Energy Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir said that the twin exits from the Turkana oil project that started with the administration of the late President Mwai Kibaki had spooked potential oil explorers.\n\nMr Chirchir the decision by the two multinationals has denied the greenfield investment from getting billions from investors to turn it into commercial production,\n\nThe CS added that heightened pressure against fossil fuels has meant that prospects for licensing blocks for a non-oil-producing country like Kenya are lower compared to a producing country where market infrastructure has been developed.\n\n\u201cWhere at a phase where if companies like Total and Africa Oil can write off their investment in a block where discoveries have been made, the risk capital that goes into a block where discoveries have not been made is a challenge,\u201d Mr Chirchir told an oil exploration summit last year.",

        "body": "When he reigned in the 70s and 80s, city billionaire Joseph Barrage Wanjui was the power behind the East African Industries (EAI). Soon, he became the face of EAI. In his earlier snapshots, he was the man with the smoking pipe\u2014a striking emblem of his bohemian lifestyle. The pipe symbolised intellectual curiosity and sophistry.\n\nBeneath, Wanjui was philanthropist. He was the first African member of the Rotary Club of Nairobi, which allowed him to carry out community work and connect with the subalterns.\n\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, Wanjui, better known as J.B. Wanjui, or simply Joe, reigned supreme as the engineer, industrialist, and CEO. His name echoed through boardrooms and factory floors alike. He hobnobbed with everyone\u2014the rich and the poor\u2014but mostly the latter.\n\nWhile his classmates and agemates held political power, JB was in business, at the helm of the most essential blue-chip company in Kenya \u2013 EAI, whose signature was \"Kwa Maisha Bora\". Here, he watched the manufacture and distribution of East Africa's leading brands: Kimbo and Cowboy cooking oils, Rexona soap, Blue Band margarine, Royco Mchuzi Mix (spice), Treetop (fruit drink) and many others. He not only made money for the company\u2019s shareholders but also became one of the wealthiest Kenyans.\n\nBrokering deals\n\nWhen he died on Tuesday, Wanjui had accomplished much more \u2013 and left a trail of companies and institutions where his intellectual and administration might be felt.

Opinion polls have shown the party heading for one of the largest majorities in modern political history.\n\nAnything other than a resounding Labour victory would have been a major shock after predictions among City traders for a night of relative calm on the currency markets, with dealing rooms across the Square Mile focused not on whether the party would win but on the scale of Starmer\u2019s landslide.\n\nAhead of official results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, the exit poll suggested Labour was on course to win a majority of 170.\n\nStarmer\u2019s expected majority is likely to solidify financial market expectations for a period of stability in British politics after years of turmoil under the Conservatives since the 2016 Brexit vote, when the shock leave outcome triggered a crash in the pound.\n\nAfter four prime ministers in five years, sterling has recovered from a record low of $1.03 in 2022, when Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget triggered a meltdown in financial markets that required the Bank of England to intervene to prevent pension funds from going bust. The pound had been one of the strongest-performing currencies across major economies in recent weeks in anticipation of the result.\n\nThe pound remained steady after the publication of exit polls on Thursday, with sterling trading unchanged on levels earlier in the day at about $1.27.\n\nLabour under Starmer has also shifted to the economic centre ground, aiming to distance the party from the more radical policies of Jeremy Corbyn after the former leader suffered a heavy defeat to Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories in 2019.\n\nAnalysts said a Labour majority below triple digits could have drawn a reaction in financial markets. Traders were also focused on whether Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party might win a sizeable number of seats, as a potential indicator of future political pressures on Starmer over the EU and immigration. The exit poll predicted that Reform would win 13 seats.\n\nStarmer has sought to maintain a cautious approach to economic policy after Labour\u2019s 2019 defeat, when Corbyn promised a far-reaching transformation of the economy, and after Truss\u2019s ill-fated economic experiment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The stability that would be provided by such a win would mean investors can cross \u2018UK political risk\u2019 off their list of worries for the time being.

        "body": "In the highway code and the law courts, there is no doubt what those big numbers in red circles mean. As a quick trip up any urban street or motorway with no enforcement cameras makes clear though, many drivers still regard speed signs as an aspiration rather than a limit.\n\nTechnology that will be required across Europe from this weekend may change that culture, because from 7 July all new cars sold in the EU and in Northern Ireland must have a range of technical safety features fitted as standard. The most notable of these is intelligent speed assistance \u2013 or colloquially, a speed limiter.\n\nThe rest of the UK is theoretically free, as ministers once liked to put it, to make the most of its post-Brexit freedoms, but the integrated nature of car manufacturing means new vehicles here will also be telling their drivers to take their foot off the accelerator. Combining satnav maps with a forward camera to read the road signs, they will automatically sound an alarm if driven too fast for the zone they are in.\n\nDrivers of most new cars will be familiar with similar features already installed, but they are currently easy to override. According to a representative at one large manufacturer: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to balance whether it makes the car safer \u2013 but it\u2019s driving people mad. In practice, we\u2019re finding that a lot of people are switching it all off.\u201d\n\nFrom now on, however, cars will be designed with systems that are impossible to permanently turn off, restarting each time the engine does. Will car lovers see this as pure progress?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that it\u2019s very difficult to argue against,\u201d says Steve Fowler, an automotive consultant and former editor of Autocar. \u201cSticking to speed limits is not only is going to save you in no end of ways, it\u2019s going to potentially save lives.\u201d\n\nSafety is the overriding reason for slower speeds, and as charities such as Brake and Rospa emphasise, even small increases above 30mph make a significant difference in outcomes, particularly for those who are not driving the car.\n\nYousif Al-Ani, the principal engineer for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) at Thatcham Research, says: \u201cModern vehicles are very good at protecting occupants in the event of a collision through passive safety features, such as airbag and crumple zones, but these have limited benefit to vulnerable road users\u201d such as pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nThe number of road deaths involving a speeding vehicle in Britain has risen faster than the wider toll since Covid, up 20% in 2022 to 303 out of 1,695.\n\nA significant minority of drivers admite to break speed limits on all types of roads, but observation of free-flowing traffic by the Department for Transport suggests the proportions are higher. According to the RAC\u2019s 2023 report on motoring, 57% of drivers said they broke the 70mph speed limit on motorways. The 30mph in most urban areas was most likely to be respected, broken by only 40%. The DfT found that on 20mph roads with free-flowing traffic \u2013 not residential streets with speed bumps - between 80 and 90% of vehicles flouted the limit.\n\nOne of the most common asssertions speeders made to the RAC was that \u201cI drive at the speed of other road users\u201d. That kind of peer pressure may be no surprise to those struggling to observe 20mph limits on, for example, bigger roads in London or Wales, as following drivers display furious incredulity; or on roads such as the M6 toll, where many appear to regard the \u00a39.70 charge as buying the right to bomb past at 80mph as much as dodge Birmingham.\n\nWith the precise readings of computers replacing wobbly speedometer needles, however, and a new generation of speed cameras upping the ante on the enforcement side, it may be ever harder to disown responsibility. Lawyers say those who switch off the speed limiter at the start of their journey may have a difficult time if they end up in court.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Questions remain over whether the technology works well enough in all real-life situations, and how comfortable people will feel with their car telling them what to do, let alone taking control of their steering, brakes and acceleration \u2013 a potentially alarming and disorienting experience.\n\n\u201cStriking a balance between safety, performance and integration to create systems that cooperate with drivers is a real challenge for manufacturers,\u201d says Al-Ani.\n\nThe consensus, however, is that the benefits far outweigh the risk. More and more drivers are happy to go slower and rely on the technology, Fowler says. \u201cDriving is changing, and I think drivers are changing. Much as it pains me to say this, they don\u2019t necessarily love the sort of things that enthusiasts in the past have loved, the engineering that goes into them.\n\n\u201cPeople are more aware that driving faster uses more fuel. If you\u2019re doing 80 on the motorway, it exponentially increases.\u201d\n\nWith the rising cost of living focusing minds on the miles per gallon as much as the speed, the joy can be in driving well rather than fast, Fowler said. \u201cWe need to breed a new generation of drivers who find driving in a more relaxed manner can be just as rewarding. Driving well, so you can keep momentum going, not having to stop and start all the time, will save you fuel, save your money, save on emissions. Maybe mpg is the new mph.\u201d",
        "summary": "The most notable of these is intelligent speed assistance \u2013 or colloquially, a speed limiter.\nDrivers of most new cars will be familiar with similar features already installed, but they are currently easy to override.\nAccording to the RAC\u2019s 2023 report on motoring, 57% of drivers said they broke the 70mph speed limit on motorways.\nOne of the most common asssertions speeders made to the RAC was that \u201cI drive at the speed of other road users\u201d.\nafter newsletter promotionAs well as the limiter, other ADAS features, including automated lane-keeping and autonomous emergency braking, will become mandatory.",

Who on earth thought this was an acceptable thing to do?\u201d\n\nThe group called on Khoury-Haq to remove the \u201cutterly crass and divisive\u201d advert and apologise to publicans.\n\nThe British Institute of Innkeeping and the beer enthusiasts\u2019 group Camra have also criticised the ad.

        "body": "Cineworld is reportedly considering closing a quarter of its UK cinemas as part of a wide-ranging restructure.\n\nThe cinema operator, which delisted from the London Stock Exchange last year after its share price collapsed, is drawing up plans to shut as many as 25 cinemas and renegotiate rent agreements at 50 more of its 100 or so UK sites, sources told Sky News.\n\nThe chain, which is being advised by the consultants Alix Partners, owns cinemas including the Picturehouse chain and employs thousands of people.\n\nThe proposals were expected to be outlined formally to creditors, including landlords, in the coming weeks and the mechanism adopted by the cinema operator was expected to be a restructuring plan rather than a company voluntary arrangement, Sky reported.\n\nCineworld said: \u201cWe continue to review our options but we don\u2019t comment on rumours and speculation.\u201d\n\nThe debt-laden chain struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to enforced closure of its sites for months. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in 2022 and lodged a reorganisation plan with an American bankruptcy court from which it emerged last year. It tried to sell its US, UK and Irish businesses last year, but did not receive any acceptable offers.\n\nCineworld was founded in 1995. It expanded under the leadership of the Greidinger family and later listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its acquisition of Regal Entertainment created the second largest cinema business in the world by number of screens, and it operates in central and eastern European markets including Poland and Hungary as well as Israel and the US.\n\nThe restructuring comes as the sector continues its recovery from the lows of pandemic lockdowns.\n\nTim Richards, the founder and chief executive of the cinema operator Vue International, told the BBC\u2019s Wake up to Money programme that the industry had been recovering slowly after the pandemic but was hit again last year by the Hollywood writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes, which affected film productions.\n\nThe sector was still suffering from the impact of the stoppages, he said: \u201cWe are not going to see a return to post-pandemic levels until some time probably 12 months from now.\u201d Vue had gone through a restructuring with shareholders last year and was now \u201cin very very good shape\u201d, he added.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This compared with the period between 2017 and 2019 when there were three consecutive box office world records set, he said.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic hit and then we had a pretty slow recovery both in film production and as an industry \u2026 and then the strikes hit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could not have been a worse time.

        "body": "Despite their low-cost, bohemian image, houseboats can cost a pretty penny and often rival the price of a property on land. Now, those living on rivers and canals in London fear they will be priced out of for good as soaring mooring fees threaten their way of life.\n\nThe Canal and River Trust (CRT) has raised mooring fees at some sites it owns by 10% for two years in a row. The Conservative government previously announced a \u00a3300m cut in funding to the trust, due from 2027. For many permanently moored in centrally located marinas, fees have shot up by thousands of pounds.\n\nIn Ice Wharf Marina, situated along Regent\u2019s Canal in London near King\u2019s Cross station, the annual mooring fees have risen by more than 50% in the past nine years. In 2015, residents could expect to pay about \u00a38,850 for the year with a 10% early payment discount. Now the discount has been cut to 2% and residents face an annual bill of about \u00a315,000.\n\nAlexandra Lyons, a university researcher, lives on a houseboat in the marina with her 15-year-old daughter. She bought her boat for \u00a3180,000 but says that due to the soaring mooring rates she would be lucky to get \u00a3100,000 for it.\n\nShe previously owned a leasehold flat in Stamford Hill, north London, but sold it at a 30% loss after the building\u2019s owner converted flats in the block into accommodation for prison leavers. \u201cIt descended into chaos and became really unsafe. They were threatening to kill my neighbour who was pregnant. It was a really difficult situation,\u201d she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alexandra Lyons (second left, seen with Julian, far left, and to her right, Patrick, David and James) said Ice Wharf was \u2018a lovely place to live\u2019. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nAfter selling her flat, Lyons said the only form of housing she could afford was a boat. \u201cI\u2019m using the money left over from the sale of my flat to pay fees to the trust. I feel like I\u2019ve been sucked into a downward spiral,\u201d she said.\n\nLyons had never lived on a boat before. \u201cIt seemed like a good option because it\u2019s in central London. My daughter goes to school nearby and so it worked for us. It\u2019s a lovely place to live, I have really nice neighbours and we all look out for each other.\u201d\n\nThe fees are causing Lyons to burn through her savings. If costs continue as they are, she could have to either leave the capital or become a continuous cruiser \u2013 boaters who must move every two weeks, which the CRT does not recommend for those with children.\n\n\u201cI love living in London. It\u2019s where I\u2019ve lived for years and years and years,\u201d she said.\n\nThe trust told the Guardian that post-election it would seek to renew its partnership with the government to \u201censure canals receive the future funding needed to continue to play their vital role in helping tackle some key societal challenges\u201d.\n\nRichard Morgan, 51, a former lawyer, has lived all over London. \u201cIn those places, I never really had a sense of community. If you were lucky, you knew the people living next to you. Living [at Ice Wharf] is the first time I\u2019ve felt a real sense of community,\u201d he said.\n\nHis 10-year-old son, who has Down\u2019s syndrome, visits him during the week. The prospect of moving would be incredibly disruptive to the boy. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t understand. This is his home and this is his community. They also look after him,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said his entire universal credit payment, including housing benefit and money for living costs combined, no longer covered his mooring fees.\n\n\u201cWe used to have a lot more younger people, key workers. They could never afford to live here now,\u201d he said.\n\nA CRT spokesperson said: \u201cAs the largest charity responsible for historic canals across England and Wales, all the income we receive is spent helping to keep them open, safe and navigable \u2026 We would be failing in our duties if we didn\u2019t charge market rates to help raise the money needed.\n\n\u201cWe own a small fraction of the moorings on the canal network, with the rest owned privately.

        "body": "The EU\u2019s top trade official, Valdis Dombrovskis, has brushed aside concerns of trade-war retaliation from Beijing against European business, after the European Commission imposed duties on Chinese electric vehicles.\n\nDombrovskis, a European Commission vice-president, told Bloomberg Television that talks with China were ongoing, adding: \u201cWe are not seeing the basis for retaliation as what we are conducting is indeed in line with WTO [World Trade Organization] rules.\u201d\n\nProvisional tariffs on Chinese EV imports to the bloc ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% will apply from Friday, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on what the EU executive called \u201cunfair\u201d subsidies from Beijing.\n\nThese tariffs \u2013 far lower than the 100% tariffs imposed by the US \u2013 will come on top of the EU\u2019s existing 10% duty on electric vehicles from China.\n\nEurope\u2019s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, reiterated its criticism on Thursday of the commission\u2019s proposed tariffs on EVs made in China, arguing that they would not strengthen Europe\u2019s car industry in the long term.\n\nVolkswagen, which is grappling with falling market share in China, has previously warned of retaliation from Beijing. \u201cThe timing of the EU Commission\u2019s decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for [battery electric vehicles] in Germany and Europe,\u201d the company said on Thursday.\n\nStellantis, owner of brands including Citro\u00ebn, Fiat and Vauxhall, has said it will not take a defensive stance in the battle for electric car sales and preferred to \u201cfight to stay competitive\u201d.\n\nThe tariffs are the result of an ongoing EU investigation launched last October, which found Chinese producers benefited from subsidies at every stage of production, from the mining of lithium used in batteries to shipping the vehicles to EU ports, such as Rotterdam and Antwerp.\n\n\u201cBased on the investigation, the commission has concluded that the BEV [battery electric vehicle] value chain in China benefits from unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers,\u201d it said in a statement to accompany a legal decision published on Thursday.\n\nThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told Xi Jinping during the Chinese president\u2019s recent visit to Europe that \u201cimbalances\u201d caused by state support for Chinese industry, leading to artificially cheap products, threatened jobs in Europe, which was \u201ca matter of great concern\u201d.\n\nChina, which has said it is looking for a \u201cmutually acceptable solution\u201d to the dispute, is investigating French cognac and pork imports over subsidies, raising the prospect of tit-for-tat measures.\n\n\u201cIt is plain for all to see who is escalating trade frictions and instigating a \u2018trade war\u2019,\u201d the Chinese commerce ministry said last month.\n\nChina has won a 25% share of the EU market for electric-battery powered cars, up from 3% in 2020. EU officials fear that without action a European industry that employs 2.5 million people and 10.3 million in the wider supply chain could be seriously hurt, just as the EU saw its solar-panel companies lose out to subsidised Chinese competitors.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Money will be collected only if the commission concludes in the autumn that the car industry would have been harmed without these duties.\n\nA final decision on definitive duties \u2013 which would be in force for five years \u2013 will only be taken in the autumn, pending a vote by the EU\u2019s 27 member states.\n\nUnder the provisional measures, China\u2019s BYD, which vies with Tesla for the spot of the world\u2019s largest producer of electric vehicles, faces a tariff of 17.4%; Geely will pay 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%.\n\nThe rates, calculated according to total subsidies and company turnover, have been modestly adjusted downwards in most cases since the required pre-disclosure of tariffs last month, after technical talks with the companies.\n\nThe tariffs enter into force despite staunch opposition from Germany, Europe\u2019s largest exporter to China. The German government has called for an \u201camicable solution\u201d, but also said \u201cserious movement is needed on the Chinese side\u201d.\n\nGerman officials do not expect to reverse the measures, which can only be overturned by a weighted majority of 15 EU member states, representing 65% of the union\u2019s population.",

        "body": "British electricity prices were double those paid in France and Spain in the spring, with the steel industry saying the disadvantage could hinder UK efforts to switch to greener technology.\n\nUK companies paid nearly \u00a366 per megawatt hour (MWh) for wholesale electricity in the second quarter of 2024, well over double the French and Spanish equivalents in the same period, according to analysis of industry data by the lobby group UK Steel.\n\nThe gap between UK prices and those of Spain and France has widened to its largest since at least 2015, when the group started tracking price movements. During that time the UK has been consistently more expensive, except during the energy crisis sparked in 2022 by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, when prices were extremely volatile.\n\nThe growing divergence between the UK and rivals\u2019 electricity costs represents a big challenge for an expected Labour government, which has voiced full-throated support for the steel industry in switching to electric technology and away from polluting coal. It has pledged \u00a33bn in subsidies.\n\nWithin hours of polls in the UK general election closing on Thursday evening, Tata Steel will tap the last iron from one of its two blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales after a closure process lasting several days.\n\nThe Indian-owned company is planning to close its second blast furnace and the rest of its steel-making process in September before building a much cleaner electric arc furnace. The plans, which have been at the centre of a row with unions, involve as many as 2,800 job losses.\n\nJonathan Reynolds, who will be business secretary if Labour wins the election, is expected to meet Tata Steel executives as soon as Monday to discuss government support for the company. The Conservative government agreed \u00a3500m in subsidies, but unions are hopeful that Labour will push for a deal that protects more jobs.\n\nTata executives have said they will consider the business case for further investments which could save more jobs, although Labour has not said what it plans for the remainder of the promised \u00a33bn.\n\nRelatively high energy prices in the UK, however, act as a brake on investment by heavy industry. Much of the European investment in steel innovation \u2013 such as making direct reduced iron using hydrogen \u2013 has been directed to Sweden, where there is abundant cheap hydropower.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The figures refer to wholesale prices only, and do not include policy levies and network charges. French costs have been helped by the return to service of several nuclear power plants, while Spain has used abundant solar power.\n\nExecutives in energy-intensive industries ranging from steel and glass to ceramics and chemicals have long complained that UK electricity costs leave them at a significant disadvantage relative to their European rivals. UK plants and factories often compete directly with EU counterparts for investments.\n\nUK Steel\u2019s energy and climate change policy manager, Frank Aaskov, said: \u201cThe steel industry is the foundation of the UK\u2019s manufacturing and economic strengths. We must not lose sight of how important electricity costs are in the move to green steel as we fully switch to electric arc furnace technology to secure steel for our nation.\n\n\u201cThe UK steel industry cannot continue to face electricity prices that are more than double what our main European competitors benefit from. For the UK steel industry to prosper and deliver on its decarbonisation targets, a new government must deliver the lowest electricity prices in Europe.\u201d\n\nThe government has taken some action to reduce industrial energy costs, including the so-called supercharger policy which cuts levies funding renewable energy for some big electricity users. Room for manoeuvre is limited, however, because UK electricity prices are closely related to prices for methane burned in power stations.",

        "body": "The British banking sector has called for the next government to penalise startups that take state aid and then list abroad amid concerns about young companies choosing foreign stock exchanges over London.\n\nUK Finance suggested subsidies and tax breaks could be clawed back, arguing in a paper published this week that companies in receipt of government help should have \u201ca two-way commitment\u201d.\n\nBritish businesspeople and City grandees have said for several years that London\u2019s stock market is in decline relative to other exchanges, notably in the US, where some fast-growing companies have said it is easier to attract investments.\n\nRecent departures from the London Stock Exchange have included the building materials company CRH, the betting company Flutter and the plumbing products company Ferguson. Perhaps most galling for the LSE, however, was the failure to attract the huge flotation of the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, which plumped for New York despite the personal lobbying of Rishi Sunak.\n\nIn a paper co-written by Global Counsel, the lobbying consultancy set up by the former Labour business minister Peter Mandelson, UK Finance suggested commitments to stay in the UK in exchange for government support could help to arrest the movement of companies abroad.\n\n\u201cThe government should also consider ways in which an expanded set of taxpayer-funded supports for early-stage growth companies involve a two-way commitment and would become repayable in part or full if a recipient ultimately chooses to list, or move valuable operations, outside the UK,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cWhere a UK company chooses to join public markets or locate is a choice for the company. However, there is a strong case for linking taxpayer supports to future commitments to using UK public markets and operating in the UK.\u201d\n\nRegulators, politicians and executives have prescribed various remedies for the perceived exodus. The Financial Conduct Authority last year unveiled sweeping reforms to make it easier for startup founders to keep controlling stakes, apeing the US.\n\nThe chief executive of the LSE, Julia Hoggett, argued last year that UK companies were not on a \u201clevel playing field\u201d because British asset managers tended to vote against larger, US-style pay packages.\n\nConor Lawlor, the managing director for capital markets and wholesale policy at UK Finance, said: \u201cWe want to see UK companies grow and be hugely successful. We also want to bolster our capital markets and the number of companies that choose to list on UK markets. Our aim is to make the UK as attractive a destination as possible.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "Is Shein really worth \u00a350bn? Reasons to be sceptical are piling up",
        "body": "A stock market listing for Shein has been talked about for so long that the round number of \u00a350bn has become attached to this Chinese-founded fast-fashion retailer as a plausible valuation. It\u2019s probably time to ask: are you sure about that number?\n\nThe figure isn\u2019t plucked out of thin air, it should be said. Shein raised money from private equity backers last year at a valuation of $66bn, which is roughly \u00a350bn. But, since the company also raised a few dollars at a $100bn valuation the previous year, it has merely demonstrated the standard truth that valuations set in thin private markets can be volatile and are not to be relied upon. Translating a sketchy private number into a hard valuation on a serious public market is a different game.\n\nThen consider what has happened since those fundraisings. For starters, Shein has failed to get itself listed in the US, seemingly because of opposition from US lawmakers. London is now the likely destination \u2013 initial papers have been filed with the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 but the label of being a New York reject, you would think, would knock a few quid off the price.\n\nNow comes something potentially far more serious. The EU is drawing up plans to impose custom duties on cheap goods imported from China and seems to have Shein \u2013 plus the likes of fellow marketplaces Temu and AliExpress \u2013 in mind.\n\nThe threshold for the levy in the EU is \u20ac150 (\u00a3127) and was probably set at that level because of the administrative hassle of chasing small sums. But, given the explosive growth in such sub-\u20ac150 parcels, there is a fair argument that the retail market is now being distorted and it has become worthwhile for the authorities to pursue duties on packets now deemed \u201cde minimis\u201d. Why should Chinese-based retailers, dispatching orders in small packets to get under the duty threshold, while also enjoying subsidised postage costs in China, enjoy such an advantage?\n\nThe same argument is running in the UK, where the threshold is \u00a3135. Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, this week called for loopholes to be closed for \u201csome of the businesses that aren\u2019t paying tax in the right way, so it\u2019s a level playing field for everybody\u201d. Absolutely right: the rules need a fundamental rethink.\n\nAn open question is how far Shein\u2019s business model would be damaged if custom duties had to be paid. Donald Tang, Shein\u2019s executive chair, has argued in the past that the firm embraces reform in the name of \u201cfair competition around the world\u201d and has claimed tax breaks are \u201cnot foundational to our success.\u201d Outside investors, one suspects, would want to see detailed evidence to support the latter claim. The core pitch to consumers is that the clothes are dirt-cheap; the customs duty advantage does not feel irrelevant.\n\nIn the meantime, the guessing-game on valuation must proceed on the basis of little detailed information. The Singapore-domiciled Shein drones on about how it uses AI to predict demand, how it ships to 150 countries and how it keeps waste to a minimum, but it is less forthcoming about financial performance.\n\nThe FT reported that it had seen a financing document showing $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in profits for 2023 and roughly $45bn (\u00a335bn) in gross merchandise value, but audited numbers are what count in a listing document and for valuation purposes. Even before one considers the controversy around alleged labour malpractices, some scepticism is required around the \u00a350bn valuation. Shein is big, but it has barely started to explain its business meaningfully.",

        "title": "Labour\u2019s housing policies have already been tried \u2013 and have failed. Here is the radical solution | Richard Sennett",
        "body": "My heart sank when I read the Labour manifesto on housing. A litany of proven past failures is presented as the shining future. For instance, the party wants to build high-density housing on brownfield sites \u2013 which has meant erecting tower blocks set in open spaces. This kind of housing has proved a social nightmare outside cities as various as Paris and Seoul; elderly people suffer from isolation, the middle-aged spend long hours commuting to work, and adolescents are more prone to the ills of drug use, depression and lack of exercise than in inner-city neighbourhoods.\n\nThe manifesto also recommends building entirely new towns, as though the way to fix a problem is to start over from scratch. The new-towns impulse has deep roots in Britain, going back to the garden city movement, but, since their beginnings, these places have struggled to become proper towns. It takes generations for a town to put in place schools or social care homes, develop a local economy of pubs or shops, and weave the complex web that is a neighbourhood. A town cannot be conjured into life with the stroke of a pen.\n\nAlthough these manifesto policies are proven failures, and though I am a Green supporter rather than Labour, I am sure those proposing them are people of good will. So why the lack of imagination? Part of the trouble is that Labour is still in thrall to its heroic age. After the second world war, the Labour government, which created the NHS, built mass housing for bombed Britain. The sheer urgency of shelter demanded instant if crude housing \u2013 and the architects and planners of the time met this challenge pretty well. But now is not then. \u201cNow\u201d means buying into expensive but poor quality housing in spaces that will never become socially and economically sustainable places.\n\nWhat would I do instead? First, work with realities on the ground. Which may mean dealing with the 270,000 abandoned properties in the UK which could be reconditioned. Much of this abandoned housing is physically OK, and has been let go for financial reasons. And though dealing with mould is not as sexy a proposition for planners as imagining a new town, it is a quicker fix. I would also emulate the efforts in New York to turn offices into residential spaces. Huge office compounds such as Canary Wharf in London and the Noma area in Manchester are currently half-empty ghost towns. It\u2019s tricky to convert bulky office spaces into flats, but Wall Street has done it in New York; so could we. More largely, the guiding idea should be to intensify life in cities rather than evacuate people to the periphery. A good city resembles a pizza, not a doughnut.\n\nWe need to rethink the very idea of \u201chousing\u201d. In an earlier era, it meant single units endlessly repeated in terraces along streets or strung up in towers. This kind of self-contained house suited nuclear families that were separated from work and emotionally inward-looking. That way of life is waning, replaced by single parents, elderly people on their own, gay and straight couples without kids; most importantly the line between home and work is blurring. These changes require a new kind of housing, which I\u2019d call sociable housing. In La Borda, a co-housing development in Barcelona, people of all sorts and ages share the same open space. Elderly people in small flats can look after the children of working parents. You can create clusters of such buildings, as the Barcelonans do in their \u201csuperblocks\u201d.\n\nSociable housing of this sort has an economic value, since costs for things such as heating and water become cheaper when shared. And it can be built so that people have shared spaces in which to work, rather than logging in to the office from their bedrooms. People can still own their own turf, as in the condominium arrangements on New York\u2019s Roosevelt Island. At the moment, I am trying to work out how sociable houses might be built so as to enable young people to get on the property ladder \u2013 but there is also a solution to the housing crisis that doesn\u2019t require a single new brick.\n\nThat is to impose real price controls in the private rented market (which has just been shown to have reached record highs in Britain). Then a landlord could not treble or quadruple rents on a whim, nor sell beyond the advertised price to the highest bidder, nor \u201cflip\u201d a small commercial space so that suddenly in place of your shoemaker you have another Starbucks in the high street. Like water or the trains, housing is a communal good, rather than an anything-goes market commodity. But price controls are the children of socialism \u2026 a word from Labour\u2019s heroic age that is seldom invoked today.",

        "title": "An (incomplete) list of every terrible policy the Conservatives have inflicted on Britain since 2010 | Jonn Elledge",
        "body": "Before he entered Downing Street, David Cameron spent several years campaigning on the slogan \u201cBroken Britain\u201d. \u201cThe challenge for the modern Conservatives,\u201d he said in 2008, \u201cis reviving our society.\u201d\n\nSuch language seems horribly ironic now. Britain had its problems in 2010 \u2013 not least the impact of the 2008 financial crash \u2013 but it had strong public services and a visibly improved public realm. In the same way, the Tory government that left office in 1997 may have presided over crumbling public services, but it could at least point to an economic boom. The government that looks set to lose office next month has failed on both counts. \u201cBroken Britain\u201d, it turns out, was a campaign promise.\n\nIt felt like it might be fun, in the run up to voting day this Thursday, to catalogue the failures that brought us here: to collate the policy mistakes that created the condition for what looks set to be a punishment election. After spending some time trawling the Guardian\u2019s archive for examples, it rapidly turned out that this wasn\u2019t fun at all.\n\nBrace yourselves. What follows is draining.\n\nThe original sin\n\nLet\u2019s start with the cuts. George Osborne, chancellor from 2010 to 2016, announced in his first budget that every area of government apart from the NHS and overseas development would need to cut its budget by an average of 25%. Some of this would be achieved by efficiency savings. Much of it was not: in many areas, the state simply gave up.\n\nSo: Sure Start centres, which offered childcare, play, and parenting and employment advice for new mothers, massively had their funding cut, storing up demand for special education and health services as children aged. Connexions, an agency offering advice and support for teenagers, suffered the same fate. Reductions in the legal aid budget meant the number of providers dropped by nearly 60%, while the number of cases funded fell by nearly 90%: vast numbers of people on lower incomes no longer have access to justice.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sure Start centres have been one of the casualties of 14 years of Tory rule. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nIn an attempt to \u201cdevolve the axe\u201d \u2013 to make others take the blame for Osborne\u2019s cuts \u2013 local government budgets were slashed by about 40% over a decade, resulting in reductions of everything from buses to libraries to bin collections to street lighting (some have been switched off). At the same time, demand for statutory services provided by councils \u2013 mainly adult social care \u2013 has continued to soar. As early as 2012, councils were sharing the \u201cgraph of doom\u201d that showed the cost of those services outstripping council funding by the early 2020s: this is why there are now suddenly quite so many isolated instances of council mismanagement. It probably didn\u2019t help that the government axed the Audit Commission, whose job it was to monitor such things. Or that it gave the public the power to veto council tax increases beyond a ceiling set by MPs.\n\nGovernment bodies were not the only ones facing cuts: so were welfare recipients. Local housing allowance was capped at the 30th percentile of local rents, meaning that from as early as 2014 people were being priced out of the housing market in many areas and pushed into homelessness. Payments that allowed disabled people to live independent lives were slashed. In 2016, working age benefits were frozen (pensions, of course, were excluded), even as rents and other costs continued to rise. In 2017, the government introduced the two-child benefit cap, claiming it would deter parents who couldn\u2019t afford children from having them. It didn\u2019t. It just cast children into avoidable poverty. By 2020, charities were calling for an investigation into the link between benefit cuts and avoidable deaths.\n\nYoung people, with their stubborn refusal to vote Conservative, were hit particularly hard. The educational maintenance allowance, a weekly payment to support 16- to 19-year-olds to stay in education, was scrapped in 2010. Two years later, university tuition fees were tripled to \u00a39,000 a year: these would be repaid in a way that, against all previously known mathematical laws, loaded costs on to students without benefiting either universities or the taxpayer. No matter: in 2016, grants for students from low-income homes were replaced with loans, too.\n\nThere are other ways in which this government has, in exactly the manner of which it once accused Labour, failed to fix the roof while the sun shone. Labour\u2019s Building Schools for the Future scheme was another early victim of austerity; by 2023, when ceilings in postwar schools were literally falling in, this was beginning to look like a mistake. This, though, was only one aspect of the vast cuts to departmental capital budgets \u2013 in the short term, such things have lower political cost \u2013 which has meant a failure to build everything from power stations to flood defences to transport infrastructure to the prison places necessary to match the tougher sentencing rhetoric.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s environmental policy. After winning a majority in 2015, Cameron vowed to \u201ccut the green crap\u201d. His government abandoned subsidies for larger solar and onshore windfarms, and introduced rules that in effect banned the latter altogether; scrapped its \u201cgreen deal\u201d home efficiency scheme, which helped pay for home insulation; removed tax incentives for drivers to switch to cleaner cars; and privatised the Green Investment Bank. (There\u2019s more, but that\u2019s quite enough.) By 2022, analysis by Carbon Brief has found, all this had cost the average household as much as \u00a3150 a year in increased energy bills.\n\n\n\nWithin a few months, though, this had been largely forgotten. The prime minister had made a rather bigger geopolitical mistake.\n\nBrexit, and everything after\n\nIt may have been an error on Cameron\u2019s part to hold a vote on a potentially nation-wrecking policy he had no desire to carry out to solve an internal party problem. It may also have been a mistake to instruct the civil service not to plan for a vote to leave.\n\nBut let\u2019s put all that aside and think instead of everything that has followed. Losing our right to live and work elsewhere on our continent. The loss of British students\u2019 access to the Erasmus exchange programme. The career-ruining barriers now faced by British bands or orchestral musicians hoping to ply their trade in Europe. The loss of the European Medicines Agency or the decline of the City, with the impact this has had for key economic sectors such as pharmaceuticals and finance. All these things hit the professional middle class that once provided a sizeable share of the Tory voting block. That fluttering you hear is the sound of chickens coming home to roost.\n\nView image in fullscreen One of the controversial \u2018go home\u2019 vans, introduce when Theresa May was the home secretary in 2013. Photograph: Home Office/PA\n\nThis was but a fraction of the damage Brexit did to the Conservative party\u2019s reputation. Consider Theresa May\u2019s lengthy refusal to guarantee the right of the 3.2 million EU citizens who\u2019d made their homes here to remain in Britain, despite the consequences for Britons who lived in Europe. Or the years of debate over whether there\u2019d need to be border posts on the island of Ireland (which went almost entirely undiscussed pre-referendum), or in the Irish Sea (which would split the UK in two). All this because Cameron wanted to neutralise the threat posed by Nigel Farage, a man the bookies have as the overwhelming favourite to be elected the MP for Clacton.\n\nSome of the trends intensified by Brexit, such as hostility to anyone seen as an outsider, were an amplification of a performative cruelty already present in certain parts of government. The \u201cgo home\u201d vans were launched by May\u2019s Home Office back in 2013. They were part of a suite of policies known as the \u201chostile environment\u201d, which aimed to make Britain a harder place to survive in as an illegal migrant, but ended up making it harder to be in as any person of colour, whether British or not. In the most extreme example, the Windrush scandal, the Home Office detained, persecuted and even deported dozens of Black British citizens just because they didn\u2019t have the appropriate piece of paperwork. The Home Office itself had destroyed them.\n\nWhatever its root, though, governmental hostility towards both foreign people and human rights has increased markedly these past few years. The UK has ramped up its visa fees. It\u2019s upped the minimum income requirement required for British people to bring home foreign partners. Less ruinously but more absurdly, the then immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, ordered an asylum centre to paint over murals of cartoon characters, presumably to stop foreign children from plotting to illegally enter the UK because they\u2019d heard it had pictures of Tom and Jerry \u2013 a policy as absurd and as arbitrary as Chris Grayling\u2019s unlawful and soon reversed attempt to ban people from sending books to those in prison.\n\nBrexit also unleashed something else: a politics that cared less for the British constitution or rule of law than for near-mystical invocations of the \u201cwill of the people\u201d \u2013 a will that always accorded, somehow, with the desires of the rightwing press. The results of this have included, but not been limited to, the failure of multiple lords chancellor to defend the independence of the judiciary from attacks by hostile newspapers; Johnson\u2019s unlawful prorogation of parliament; new restrictions on the right to protest; and the Elections Act \u2013 a naked attempt to help the governing party.\n\nAll these trends have culminated in the Rwanda scheme, in which parliament passed a law declaring that country a safe destination for refugees \u2013 in defiance of not just international law but of objective reality, purely so that ministers could be cruel towards some of the most desperate people in the world. This sucked in a vast amount of political energy at a time when poll after poll has shown that voters\u2019 real priorities are the cost of living crisis and the NHS, about which ministers were doing nothing. And it hasn\u2019t even \u201cstopped the boats\u201d.\n\nThings can only get worse\n\nThere\u2019s another type of government failure: the things that can\u2019t necessarily be attributed to a single bad policy, but where multiple policies or a failure to act have contributed to a sense the country is going backwards. For instance, in many policy areas, there\u2019s been a creeping centralisation of power in Westminster \u2013 coupled with the aforementioned weakening of local government \u2013 which has surely contributed to the general sense of alienation from politics that has characterised this election.\n\nThere\u2019s also been the repeated failures to get Britain building and price-inflating schemes such as help to buy; house prices have soared and home ownership rates tumbled; and our housing now offers the worst value for money of any advanced economy. This too has been bad for the Tories\u2019 electoral prospects. Those who can\u2019t start families are less likely to grow more conservative \u2013 why support capitalism if you can\u2019t accumulate capital? The government has remained unpersuaded to improve the lot of renters, even so.\n\nWages have stagnated for more than a decade, meaning living standards in the UK have fallen behind those in peer nations. Nearly a fifth of the population are in poverty, including 3.6 million children; more and more families now rely on food banks. There are 74% more people sleeping rough than there were in 2010, and more than 150,000 families are now homeless \u2013 a record number. The ONS is considering no longer recording their mortality rates.\n\nMeanwhile, hospital waiting times are at a record high. (The then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, actually scrapped the targets in 2010, but it went so well the government U-turned within 18 months.) The government has attempted to blame this on Covid, and that clearly was a factor \u2013 but stories about record waiting times had been a regular feature of the domestic news pages long before any of us ever heard the phrase \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Food banks have become increasingly prevalent in the UK over the past 14 years. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nWhile we\u2019re doing healthcare: ambulance waiting times have soared, in large part due to bottlenecks elsewhere in the health service that leave vehicles queueing outside hospitals. In 2022, more than 500 people died while waiting for one. Demand for GPs\u2019 services has also risen, but the shortage of doctors has meant an increase in practice list sizes and growing difficulty getting an appointment. (Many people have stopped trying, either letting problems fester, which will pile up more costs for the health service down the line, or where possible going private.) NHS dental deserts mean that, in February of this year, a new practice in Bristol made headlines when 1,500 people queued for hours to sign up.\n\nThrough all this, the government came up with plans for neither the funding nor workforce of adult social care \u2013 May did try; it cost her her majority \u2013 and its failure has had a direct impact on the NHS, swallowing much of the recent panicked increase in its funding. Even once you are dead, the waiting lists don\u2019t stop. Covid, cuts and a dodgy computer system have all meant that the time families wait for the grant of probate \u2013 access to a late family member\u2019s estate \u2013 has increased from a couple of weeks to as much as a year.\n\nAll these things have broken Britain \u2013 but they\u2019ve created the conditions for an unprecedented Tory wipeout, too. The Faustian bargain offered by previous iterations of the Conservative party was that it might damage the social fabric, but it could, at least, make the middle classes rich. After 14 years of alternating lethargy and crisis, that very clearly no longer applies.\n\nAnd the rest\n\nThe list above is in no way comprehensive: my word count was simply not that long. I\u2019ve not even mentioned academisation, the radical overhaul of England\u2019s school support and accountability structures, because there\u2019s some evidence standards have improved (even if some studies have found that council schools outperform academies). Nor have I risked getting lost in the weeds of the complex and disastrous deckchair-rearranging exercise that were Lansley\u2019s NHS reforms over half a decade, which burned through vast quantities of goodwill and energy for no clear benefit.\n\nI\u2019ve missed the 2020 A-levels scandal in which students\u2019 lives were wrecked by a badly designed algorithm. And the exclusion of several million self-employed people from any and all pandemic support. And Grayling\u2019s privatisation of probation, which increased the risk to the public so markedly that it was reversed by his successors. And the ministerial merry-go-round in which the UK\u2019s already brief average ministerial tenure collapsed from a couple of years to only eight months, meaning that even those less out of their depth than Grayling were never likely to get a handle on the job. I\u2019ve not even mentioned Liz Truss.\n\nBut the point is clear: in a vast number of ways, in almost every realm of government activity, this lot have made life worse. The policies referred to in every sentence in this article have damaged untold thousands of lives. The Conservative party has created exactly the broken Britain it claimed its mission was to repair.\n\nYou may not think this Labour party deserves to win. But it\u2019s hard to refute the idea that, after the last 14 years, the Tories deserve to lose.\n\nJonn Elledge\u2019s new book, A History of the World in 47 Borders: The Stories Behind the Lines on Our Maps, is out now",

        "body": "The artificial intelligence boom has driven big tech share prices to fresh highs, but at the cost of the sector\u2019s climate aspirations.\n\nGoogle admitted on Tuesday that the technology is threatening its environmental targets after revealing that datacentres, a key piece of AI infrastructure, had helped increase its greenhouse gas emissions by 48% since 2019. It said \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d around reaching its target of net zero emissions by 2030 \u2013 reducing the overall amount of CO2 emissions it is responsible for to zero \u2013 included \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict\u201d.\n\nIt follows Microsoft, the biggest financial backer of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, admitting that its 2030 net zero \u201cmoonshot\u201d might not succeed owing to its AI strategy.\n\nSo will tech be able to bring down AI\u2019s environmental cost, or will the industry plough on regardless because the prize of supremacy is so great?\n\nWhy does AI pose a threat to tech companies\u2019 green goals? Datacentres are a core component of training and operating AI models such as Google\u2019s Gemini or OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. They contain the sophisticated computing equipment, or servers, that crunch through the vast reams of data underpinning AI systems. They require large amounts of electricity to run, which generates CO2 depending on the energy source, as well as creating \u201cembedded\u201d CO2 from the cost of manufacturing and transporting the necessary equipment.\n\n\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, total electricity consumption from datacentres could double from 2022 levels to 1,000 TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, equivalent to the energy demand of Japan, while research firm SemiAnalysis calculates that AI will result in datacentres using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030. Water usage is significant too, with one study estimating that AI could account for up to 6.6bn cubic metres of water use by 2027 \u2013 nearly two-thirds of England\u2019s annual consumption.\n\nWhat do experts say about the environmental impact? A recent UK government-backed report on AI safety said that the carbon intensity of the energy source used by tech firms is \u201ca key variable\u201d in working out the environmental cost of the technology. It adds, however, that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of AI model training still relies on fossil fuel-powered energy. Indeed, tech firms are hoovering up renewable energy contracts in an attempt to meet their environmental goals. Amazon, for instance, is the world\u2019s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy. Some experts argue, though, that this pushes other energy users into fossil fuels because there is not enough clean energy to go round. \u201cEnergy consumption is not just growing, but Google is also struggling to meet this increased demand from sustainable energy sources,\u201d says Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a website monitoring the environmental impact of new technologies.\n\nIs there enough renewable energy to go round? Global governments plan to triple the world\u2019s renewable energy resources by the end of the decade to cut consumption of fossil fuels in line with climate targets. But the ambitious pledge, agreed at last year\u2019s COP28 climate talks, is already in doubt and experts fear that a sharp increase in energy demand from AI datacentres may push it further out of reach. The IEA, the world\u2019s energy watchdog, has warned that even though global renewable energy capacity grew by the fastest pace recorded in the past 20 years in 2023, the world may only double its renewable energy by 2030 under current government plans. The answer to AI\u2019s energy appetite may be for tech companies to invest more heavily in building new renewable energy projects to meet their growing power demand.\n\nHow soon can we build new renewable energy projects? Onshore renewable energy projects such as wind and solar farms are relatively fast to build \u2013 they can take less than six months to develop. However, sluggish planning rules in many developed countries alongside a global logjam in connecting new projects to the power grid could add years to the process. Offshore windfarms and hydro power schemes face similar challenges in addition to construction times of between two and five years. This has raised concerns over whether renewable energy can keep pace with the expansion of AI. Major tech companies have already tapped a third of US nuclear power plants to supply low-carbon electricity to their datacentres, according to the Wall Street Journal. But without investing in new power sources these deals would divert low-carbon electricity away from other users leading to more fossil fuel consumption to meet overall demand.\n\nWill AI\u2019s demand for electricity grow for ever? Normal rules of supply and demand would suggest that, as AI uses more electricity, the cost of energy rises and the industry is forced to economise. But the unique nature of the industry means that the largest companies in the world may instead decide to plough through spikes in the cost of electricity, burning billions of dollars as a result. The largest and most expensive datacentres in the AI sector are those used to train \u201cfrontier\u201d AI, systems such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 which are more powerful and capable than any other. The leader in the field has changed over the years, but OpenAI is generally near the top, battling for position with Anthropic, maker of Claude, and Google\u2019s Gemini. Already, the \u201cfrontier\u201d competition is thought to be \u201cwinner takes all\u201d, with very little stopping customers from jumping to the latest leader. That means that if one business spends $100m on a training run for a new AI system, its competitors have to decide to spend even more themselves or drop out of the race entirely. Worse, the race for so-called \u201cAGI\u201d, AI systems that are capable of doing anything a person can do, means that it could be worth spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a single training run \u2013 if doing so led your company to monopolise a technology that could, as OpenAI says, \u201celevate humanity\u201d.",

        "body": "I have much good fortune in my life, but in one respect I am unlucky: I live in the part of the country with the longest waiting times for driving tests, and I have been learning to drive.\n\nI began learning in 2022. In June 2023, I was test-ready. But when I tried to book my test, there were none available until mid-November, meaning I had to pay for six extra months of lessons so I wouldn\u2019t forget what I had learned.\n\nI failed that test \u2013 a stupid, nervous mistake. After time off to lick my wounds, I rebooked my test in January. The earliest test I could get? In late June 2024.\n\nThe result of all this was that by the time I went for my second test last month, I had spent at least \u00a31,000 on a year of unnecessary lessons. And I had the pressure of knowing that if I failed, I\u2019d have to wait another six months, and pay out yet again.\n\nI am not alone. In 2019, the average waiting time for a driving test at my local London test centre was 2.8 weeks. As of 4 March 2024, it was 24 weeks. Four years on from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused driving tests to be suspended, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), which carries out the tests in Great Britain (Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Driver and Vehicle Agency), has not recovered.\n\nWhile waiting times are coming down in Wales and Scotland, in England the situation is getting worse. In March 2022, the average waiting time for a practical car driving test in England was 14.5 weeks. In March 2023, it was 15.8 weeks. As of March 2024, it was 17.8 weeks, more than double the seven-week target set out in the DVSA\u2019s annual report.\n\nYou give them your personal information, they use it to abuse the system, and create a bigger backlog, and it goes on\u2019 Max Sobol\n\nBut according to the DVSA, I am the problem. Me and all the other learner drivers, for booking driving tests before they\u2019re ready. As a result, says the DVSA chief executive, Loveday Ryder, in a chiding blog post, \u201cthose who need to drive for their job, such as nurses and carers\u201d aren\u2019t able to access tests. If only we\u2019d stop being so irresponsible, NHS nurses and carers could go to work.\n\nThere is a straightforward way to determine whether this is true. If learner drivers booking tests when they aren\u2019t ready is causing the backlog, the pass rate would be down post-Covid.\n\nBut Guardian analysis of DVSA data reveals that the pass rate for learner drivers has actually gone up post-pandemic. In the five years from April 2014 to March 2019, the average pass rate in England was 47.8%, whereas post-Covid, from April 2021 to December 2023, it averaged 48.2%. England is no outlier: throughout Great Britain the pass rate post-Covid is higher \u2013 46.6% for April 2014 to March 2019, versus 48.9% for April 2021 to December 2023.\n\nSo if learner drivers aren\u2019t the problem, what\u2019s really going on at the DVSA?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for festival tickets,\u201d says Calu Malta, 27, who works for a non-profit organisation. In March, she woke up at 6am on a Monday morning, when the DVSA releases new tests, to book a driving test near her home in north London. Malta will have to wait six months for her test, in August.\n\nWhen a test becomes available, says Sue Smith, 62, a Newbury driving instructor who searches for her students, \u201cit\u2019s like having heart palpitations. You have to have the fastest fingers in the west.\u201d As a result, some learners are seeing their theory tests, which are only valid for two years, expire before they can pass.\n\nThere is a way to get a test faster \u2013 on the black market. Dozens of businesses offer fast-track tests, advertised through WhatsApp groups, websites and driving schools. The array of dates on offer is staggering. Fees range from \u00a3120 to \u00a3350 for tests that should cost \u00a362.\n\nView image in fullscreen Max Sobol: \u2018I suppose it\u2019s silly giving these companies your driving licence details, but it\u2019s the only way you can get a test.\u2019 Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\nWhen faced with an impossible dilemma \u2013 spend hundreds on extra lessons, or pay touts \u2013 many decide that the second option is cheaper. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d says Dan Cloake, a 35-year-old lighting technician from east London. In April, he paid \u00a3170 for a fast-track driving test through a WhatsApp group promising \u201cearly driving bookings\u201d. \u201cThis is a public service and we are having to pay this private tax.\u201d\n\nIn order to book his test, Cloake sent the touts a photo of his provisional driving licence. \u201cIt had my home address, my date of birth, quite a lot of personal information on it,\u201d he says. Is he worried about what the touts have done with his data, I ask.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Cloake slowly. \u201cA little bit. Now I am thinking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a constant battle to keep on top of these bot things,\u201d said Ryder when giving evidence to the transport committee last July. Touts use automated software, known as bots, to reload the DVSA website until a test becomes available, then grab it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all above board,\u201d insists a Bradford-based driving instructor as he offers me a fast-track driving test slot for \u00a3200. \u201cNothing illegal.\u201d I\u2019ve called asking for his assistance in booking a driving test in Thornbury, where waiting times last year averaged 24 weeks. \u201cYou tell me when you need it,\u201d he says genially.\n\nHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s not illegal to sell a driving test for profit, although it is a violation of the DVSA\u2019s terms of use. But when you examine how the touts operate, evidence of illegality emerges.\n\nThere are two main ways to book a driving test: the public access system, open to the general public, and the business system, accessible to driving instructors and driving schools. On the business system, instructors and schools can book multiple tests, and, crucially, they can swap tests between different learners.\n\nBut in order to book a test, everyone, including instructors, needs a provisional driving licence, registered to someone who has passed their theory test. So how do the test companies do it?\n\n\u201cOn our system,\u201d boasts the director of one firm that offers fast-track test slots for between \u00a3190 and \u00a3250, \u201cwe have loads and loads of other licences, all looking for test dates. So what we\u2019re able to do, using their licence, is hold and reserve test dates, basically swap people in.\u201d\n\nThe smooth-talking Londoner says that one of the agencies he partners with to book tests has \u201c8,000 licences able to hold and reserve test dates for other customers. And as soon as one comes available, they\u2019ll hold it, reserve it, wait for the customer to confirm, then just swap them in.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Waiting for a driving test is like \u2018waiting for festival tickets\u2019, says learner driver Calu Malta. Photograph: macana/Alamy\n\nThis is how some touts operate: by reserving tests using other people\u2019s driving licences without their consent, in a probable violation of data protection laws, and then switching in the details of whoever buys the test. A Time Out writer recently wrote about having her driving licence used to book 53 tests without her knowledge. She\u2019d previously given her details to touts.\n\nFraudsters have even sent out phishing emails, purporting to be from the DVSA, asking driving instructors to share learners\u2019 licences. \u201cThe police don\u2019t have the resources to take proper action against fraud,\u201d says Dr Ben Collier, an online crime expert at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cFrauds like this are almost seen as not illegal.\u201d\n\nIn the driving instructor community, it\u2019s common knowledge that some instructors participate in these scams, to the frustration of their peers. \u201cInstructors are buying tests,\u201d says Simon Brady, 59, an instructor from Bradford. \u201cThey do it without their pupil\u2019s knowledge. They get their driving licence details and sell it to someone else.\u201d\n\nWhen Max Sobol, a 39-year-old film director from east London, paid \u00a3132 for a fast-track driving test in April 2022, he sent a photo of his driving licence over WhatsApp to the touts. Sobol failed his test in May and struggled to book another. Not wanting to pay for another black market test, Sobol\u2019s partner contacted the DVSA in July 2022 \u2013 only for the DVSA to tell her that Sobol actually had a test booked for that October.\n\nStopping the ability to swap tests means the scam will fall to pieces. It\u2019s the only solution. But the DVSA won\u2019t do it Simon Brady, driving instructor\n\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s silly to be giving these companies your driving licence details,\u201d Sobol says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only way you can get a test. You give them your personal information, they use it to abuse the system, and create a bigger backlog, and it goes on. You\u2019re over a barrel with it.\u201d\n\nLike an arsonist who burns down your house, then sells you a tent, the touts offer a solution to a problem they created. But Ryder doesn\u2019t see the black market touts as fuelling the crisis, only as a symptom of it. \u201cThis problem,\u201d she told the committee, \u201cwill go away when the wait times come down.\u201d\n\nAs well as blaming long waiting times on the public, for booking tests before they are ready, the DVSA has pointed the finger at the people who carry them out. Driving examiners went on strike in December 2022 and January 2023. \u201cWe were seeing a steady improvement \u2026 until the industrial action part started,\u201d Ryder told the select committee.\n\nThe DVSA does not appear to have undertaken much soul-searching about whether it might have done anything differently. After scores of driving instructors left angry comments under a post about waiting times, the DVSA turned off comments on a subsequent post. \u201cThis is not about censoring your views,\u201d it said.\n\nYet the cause of the waiting times crisis is simple. There aren\u2019t enough tests to clear the backlog, and many of those that are available are being sold on the black market.\n\nAccording to Guardian analysis of DVSA data, as of 2024, the total Covid backlog for Great Britain is more than 1m tests. Since pandemic restrictions ended in 2021, the agency has made available an extra 212,000 tests, meaning that, at the current rate, it will not clear the Covid backlog until 2026.\n\n\u201cThe core of this problem is that there are not enough practical tests for everyone,\u201d says Rachel Newland, 46, a driving instructor from Reading. \u201cAnd the reason for that is that there is an examiner retention crisis. Until the DVSA acknowledges that, nothing will be fixed.\u201d Newland campaigns for the DVSA to increase examiner pay: a petition she set up currently has 1,883 signatures.\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul Weinberger, who has created a bot to get around block bookings by companies. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian\n\nAs of July 2023, the DVSA had recruited 474 new driving examiners since March 2021. But about 15 examiners quit each month.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. Examiners test seven students a day, work weekends for no additional pay and are often abused by members of the public. For all of this, they are paid about \u00a327,000 a year.\n\nAs civil servants, driving examiners cannot speak to the media. But conversations with well-placed sources reveal a stressed-out workforce. Candidates are angry at having to wait so long for tests, and take it out on them. They are being sent out with unsafe candidates in non-dual control cars. They are genuinely fearful of crashes. They feel frustrated and underappreciated. Another strike was narrowly avoided earlier this year.\n\nBecause the government determines civil service pay, the DVSA cannot put up salaries. But it could ask the government to make reselling tests illegal.\n\n\u201cStop the ability to swap tests,\u201d says Brady. \u201cThen the whole scam will fall to pieces. It\u2019s the only solution. But the DVSA won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe DVSA is resistant to this change because most driving instructors use the test-swapping service responsibly, to trade candidates who aren\u2019t ready for their tests with candidates who are. Yet those benefits are marginal, given the way the system facilitates an exploitative black market. We cannot swap GP appointments, or primary school places, or NHS operations. Why must we be able to switch driving tests?\n\nIn the absence of the one change that would work, the DVSA has reduced the amount of times driving tests can be changed from 10 to six, and implemented more anti-bot protections incorporating AI technology. It says it has created nearly 150,000 new tests and redeployed managers to help clear the backlog. It has a counter-fraud team that reports to social media networks if necessary. To date it has issued 231 warnings, suspended 687 accounts, and closed 570 accounts for misuse of the booking system, and removed 4,700 accounts that were not linked to approved driving instructors. It urges the public only to book their driving tests themselves, or through their driving instructor, to prevent their information being misused.\n\nIn January 2023 it made it a violation of its terms of service to sell driving tests for profit, or use driving licences without consent. But dozens of touts continue to flout these rules. And so English learners must choose between waiting six months for a test, or paying the touts and risk having their data misused. But there is a third way.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right that I should have to pay the black market for something that\u2019s a public service,\u201d says Paul Weinberger. In July 2022, Weinberger, who is 31 and lives in south London, needed a driving test, but his test centre had an 18.5-week wait.\n\nIt took Weinberger, who is a software developer, one evening to build a bot to search the DVSA website, and it took that bot two days to find him a test. \u201cIt was quite simple,\u201d he says. After he\u2019d passed his test, Weinberger uploaded details of the bot to Reddit. \u201cPlease be kind,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand do try to not make a business out of this.\u201d\n\nSince Weinberger built his bot, the DVSA has introduced stricter anti-bot protections. I meet Weinberger in a cafe to see if his bot still works. He instals it on my laptop and smiles as it begins reloading the DVSA page, looking for slots. \u201cIt still works,\u201d he says.\n\nOne woman had her driving licence used to book 53 tests without her knowledge. She\u2019d previously given her details to touts\n\nRyder has said that the DVSA plans to rebuild its booking system. If that removes the ability to switch tests, an exploitative industry will slam to an emergency stop. But the conditions that allowed it to start up will remain.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a lot of public services are broken,\u201d says Cloake. \u201cThis is just another example.\u201d Fourteen years since austerity began, we are used to non-functioning public infrastructure. We pay a tax to access basic services, such as booking driving tests, because we have no expectation of things getting better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m originally from Brazil,\u201d says Malta. \u201cIn Brazil, you have to pay to make things accessible. It\u2019s scary to see that happening here.\u201d\n\nAs for me, I passed my driving test. If I\u2019d failed, I wouldn\u2019t have waited another six months for a test. I\u2019d have fired up Weinberger\u2019s bot instead: my indefatigable friend, a middleman who\u2019s not trying to make money from my misfortune.\n\nWith data by Tural Ahmedzade",

        "body": "Average private rents in Great Britain have climbed to record highs, prompting a call for the next government to prioritise measures to help create an extra 120,000 rental properties.\n\nData shows that the typical advertised rent outside London reached a record \u00a31,316 a calendar month in May, the property website Rightmove said. The figure for London was \u00a32,652 a month \u2013 almost three times the \u00a3894 asked for in north-east England.\n\nRightmove said the average advertised rent outside London in May was an inflation-busting 7% higher than a year earlier.\n\nIn the capital, meanwhile, an improvement in the balance between supply and demand meant annual rent growth has slowed from its peak of 18% in 2022 to 4% in May this year, still higher than the 2% official consumer prices index (CPI) inflation figure for May.\n\nRightmove called on the next government \u201cto accelerate housebuilding and incentivise landlords to invest in more homes for tenants\u201d to help tackle the supply and demand imbalances and stabilise rental growth.\n\nIt said its analysis showed about 120,000 more rental properties were needed to return rent growth to \u201cmore normal levels\u201d of about 2% a year, based on current demand.\n\nRent rises have been blamed largely on demand greatly outstripping supply, exacerbated by landlords with buy-to-let mortgages trying to pass on sizeable increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.\n\nIn many areas there were \u201cnowhere near enough homes to satisfy the number of tenants looking to move\u201d, Rightmove said.\n\nScotland was the hardest hit by supply and demand imbalances, the property company said. By contrast, the situation had improved in London owing to fewer tenants looking to move and an increase in available properties to rent.\n\nTim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s property expert, said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget there was a time before the pandemic where rental price growth was more stable. [Annual] price growth at 7% suggests we are still out of balance.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe next government should be prioritising an improvement to the planning process, an acceleration of housebuilding, and encouraging more supply into the rental market.\u201d\n\nSeparate figures from Propertymark, a professional body for estate and letting agents, showed there were about nine new applicants registered for each available UK property in May.\n\nIt said that though most of its members reported that rents were continuing to increase or were static, there was some good news for prospective tenants with 18% of firms reporting rents falling against 12% in April.",

        "body": "Britain\u2019s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for many families.\n\nFigures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that annual UK shop price inflation cooled last month to 0.2%, down from 0.6% in May \u2013 the slowest pace since October 2021 \u2013 as retailers cut the prices of many of their key products, including butter and coffee.\n\nComing before Thursday\u2019s general election, separate figures from the RAC show that petrol and diesel prices fell for a second straight month in June to ease pressure on families affected by the cost of living crisis. The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still \u201ctoo expensive\u201d in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nAccording to the RAC\u2019s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p.\n\n\u201cFuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,\u201d the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe RAC\u2019s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nHe said prices at forecourts owned and run by Shell and BP were the most expensive, highlighting Competition and Markets Authority data showing that Shell-owned sites were the most expensive in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe remain baffled how the very same fuel can be sold for such vastly different prices by the biggest retailers, whether they\u2019re run by supermarkets or the world\u2019s largest oil companies,\u201d he said.\n\nRishi Sunak has made lower inflation the cornerstone of the Conservatives\u2019 general election campaign after a return in the official headline rate to the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% in May, down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nThe shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, however, has said pressure on household finances remains \u201cacute\u201d as average prices remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The figures suggest average prices in UK shops are continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.\n\nThe chief executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said retailers had, however, cut the prices of some key products including butter and coffee. Non-food prices were also in deflation \u2013 meaning average prices are falling compared with a year earlier \u2013 as shops tried to boost their sales by discounting products.\n\n\u201cThis was particularly true for TVs with great deals to capitalise on the Euros fever,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever wins Thursday\u2019s election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.\u201d",

        "body": "House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.\n\nBritain\u2019s largest building society said prices had risen slightly in June amid the impact of higher mortgage costs, with a 0.2% month-on-month increase.\n\nOn an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022. The average price of a UK home was \u00a3266,064 in June, Nationwide said.\n\nHouse prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings. Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.\n\nRobert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, said mortgage rates were still well above the record lows of 2021 and that rising costs had outstripped the benefit from stronger levels of average pay growth in recent months.\n\n\u201cAs a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay \u2013 well above the long run average of 30%,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparate figures from the Bank of England revealed a slowdown in housing market activity in May as people borrowed \u00a31.2bn of mortgage debt, down from \u00a32.2bn in April. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell slightly from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May.\n\nOfficial figures show average annual wage growth in the three months to April was 6%, above the rate of inflation, which fell back to the Bank\u2019s target of 2% in May after reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022, the highest level in four decades.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "The EU is moving forward with plans to impose customs duty on cheap goods in a shift that could hit imports from online retailers and harm a hoped-for London listing by the fast-fashion seller Shein.\n\nThe potential change comes amid growing disquiet among retailers based in mainland Europe, the UK and the US about rising competition from the Chinese-linked marketplaces Shein and Temu, which exploit a loophole that excludes low-value items from import duty.\n\nIn the EU, the threshold for the levy is \u20ac150 (\u00a3127) and in the UK it is \u00a3135, enabling retailers such as Shein to ship products directly from overseas to shoppers in those markets without paying any import duty. In the UK, items valued at \u00a339 or less also do not attract import VAT.\n\nSubsidised postage costs in China make it more cost-effective for businesses based there to send cheap goods by air.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said: \u201cIn May last year we put on the table customs reforms for a simple, smarter and safer customs union. What we have proposed now is there is no exemption any more for packages valued at below \u20ac150.\u201d\n\nThe e-commerce proposal must first be discussed and accepted by the European parliament, which sits again later this month.\n\nLast year, 2.3bn items below the duty-free \u20ac150 threshold were imported into the EU, according to a report in the Financial Times that highlighted the potential change.\n\nJohn Stevenson, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said that the impact of a change in the rules on Shein \u201cwould be huge depending on the territory\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Shein logo and web shop. Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/Reuters\n\nSome countries imposed import duties of up to 30%, he said, and having to pay that would force Shein to either completely change its business model, put up prices or take a hit on profit.\n\n\u201cThe whole model is based on not paying duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have a massive impact.\u201d\n\nStevenson was quite sceptical that EU countries would be able to close the loophole in the short term, given the complexity and cost of checking billions of parcels.\n\nHowever, he said the issue would be high on investors\u2019 list of concerns alongside potential ethical issues in its supply chain if Shein went ahead with launching a London listing, as is expected as early as this autumn.\n\nShein also faces increased competition from fellow social media-driven retailers including TikTok Shop and Temu, as well as the post-Covid return to the high street by shoppers, which has helped the likes of Primark.\n\nResearch from Earnest Analytics found that Shein shoppers in the US allocated 43% of their online discount spending to the brand last month compared with 66% a year ago, just before TikTok transactions began.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, some financial planners have said their wealthy clients are selling assets and property in the fear that Labour could increase capital gains tax.\n\nThe reading on the S&P Global services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) slowed from 52.9 in May to 52.1 in June, its lowest reading since November but revised up from a preliminary estimate of 51.2. A reading of 50 separates growth in business activity from contraction.\n\nHayes said the evidence from the PMI surveys suggested Britain\u2019s economy was on track for another quarter of growth in the three months to the end of June, \u201calbeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter\u2019s 0.7%\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "A landslide victory for Keir Starmer in the general election on Thursday could hand Britain a stability premium in global markets, boosting the pound, shares and investment in the UK at a time of mounting political turmoil elsewhere, City investors have said.\n\nIn sharp contrast with Conservative party warnings over the dangers of a large Labour majority, analysts in the City of London said the prospect of a resounding mandate for Starmer\u2019s party could secure Britain\u2019s \u201csafe haven\u201d status among investors in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nAfter failing to close the gap in opinion polls during the election campaign, Rishi Sunak made a last-ditch warning that a Starmer \u201csupermajority\u201d would \u201cbankrupt people in every generation\u201d.\n\nHowever, City analysts said a Labour landslide could pave the way for global investment in Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty since the 2016 Brexit referendum under the Tories, which had clouded the prospects for international investors.\n\nHighlighting mounting political instability on both sides of the Atlantic and the meltdown in financial markets triggered by Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget \u2013 when investors spoke of a \u201cmoron premium\u201d for Britain \u2013 City experts said a clear outcome on Thursday could return Britain to a steadier footing.\n\nNuwan Goonetilleke, the head of shareholder assets at Phoenix Group, which manages more than \u00a3280bn in investments, said money was already pouring into London-listed assets in anticipation of a Labour victory.\n\n\u201cThe UK is really being seen not just as a safe haven, but the safest of havens \u2013 especially in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the previous gyrations seen in the markets, whether that\u2019s Liz Truss or the leftwing policies from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour in 2019, we\u2019re not really seeing any of those wild swings now. That tells you how far the UK has come from Brexit when there were huge unknowns priced-in for the UK.\n\n\u201cWith a Labour majority, it continues to really double down on that promise of economic stability, growth and wealth creation.\u201d\n\nThe pound has rallied against the euro on global currency markets since Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in France in early June, in a development opening the door to a possible far-right victory or hung parliament in one of the EU\u2019s most powerful economies.\n\nJoshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said: \u201cGiven the political shockwaves being felt around Europe, the prospect of a stable political environment could yet help place the UK economy as a haven for years to come.\u201d\n\nWhile UK government bond yields have remained stable in recent weeks, French borrowing costs have risen sharply. Investors said uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election in November had also bolstered UK assets.\n\nAny other result than a clear Labour victory would come as a shock in City dealing rooms after failure by Sunak to close a 20-point gap in opinion polls, which show the Conservatives on track for the party\u2019s worst defeat since at least 1906.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, some party insiders believe ditching Corbyn-era policies is important for wooing swing voters and tackling accusations of fiscal incompetence that have clung to the party since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Labour leader and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also argue that restoring political stability after years of Tory infighting \u2013 leading the party to its fourth prime minister since 2016 \u2013 could reinvigorate private investment in Britain, helping to meet his growth ambitions without the need for large tax rises or additional government borrowing.\n\nWhile Sunak has argued \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d taken under his premiership have helped the economy to \u201cturn a corner,\u201d which could enable interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, opinion polls suggest many voters are refusing to give him much credit after 14 years of Tory rule.\n\nMichael Browne, chief investment officer at the asset manager Martin Currie, said Britain\u2019s economy and financial markets could benefit from a period of stability under a Labour government that was \u201cmore moderate and international in tone\u201d.\n\nHe said the situation was comparable to 1997 when UK government bonds and sterling rallied in anticipation of Tony Blair\u2019s landslide victory. \u201cTo quote a well-known campaign slogan from 1997: \u2018Things can only get better.\u2019 With the current backdrop we would like to think so for the UK\u2019s equity assets.\u201d",

        "title": "Labour is putting its plans for Britain in the hands of private finance. It could end badly | Daniela Gabor",
        "body": "The Labour party has a plan for returning to power: it will get BlackRock to rebuild Britain. Its reasoning is straightforward. A cash-strapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance, attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of Tory underinvestment. Labour has already done the arithmetic: to mobilise \u00a33 of private capital from institutional investors, you need to offer them \u00a31 in public subsidies. But every time you hear Labour announce such an infrastructure partnership, think of the hidden politics. BlackRock will privatise Britain \u2013 our housing, education, health, nature and green energy \u2013 with our taxpayer money as sweetener.\n\nBlackRock has long peddled the idea of public-private partnerships for infrastructure, climate and development. Yet its political momentum has recently accelerated. When its chair, Larry Fink, the world\u2019s most powerful financier, sat with world leaders at the G7 summit last month, he promised the following: rich countries need growth, infrastructure investment can deliver that growth, but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated $75tn (\u00a359tn) necessary by 2040. Trillions, however, are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions (BlackRock, the largest of these firms, manages about $10tn, as a shrinking welfare state pushes us \u2013 future pensioners \u2013 into its arms).\n\nIf governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can\u2019t it deploy trillions without the government\u2019s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.\n\nBut for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to \u201cderisk\u201d investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.\n\nThe choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords \u2013 the most prominent being Blackstone, the private equity fund \u2013 can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about \u00a31.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.\n\nLook behind Blackstone\u2019s returns \u2013 which come from rents and rising house prices \u2013 and you will find the state\u2019s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support \u2013 such as housing benefit \u2013 that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we\u2019re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.\n\nLabour\u2019s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer\u2019s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to \u201chow do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?\u201d This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn\u2019t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.\n\nAlready, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure \u2013 though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer\u2019s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people\u2019s living standards.\n\nInstead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What\u2019s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.\n\nDaniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol",

It can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth. It can also see how market turmoil around the French elections plays out.\u201d\n\nIn its flash estimate for June, Eurostat figures showed services had the highest annual inflation rate at 4.1%, a stable rate compared with May. Annual price growth for food, alcohol and tobacco slowed from 2.6% in May to 2.5%.\n\nRiccardo Marcelli Fabiani, a senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cInflation resumed its descent after it had been temporarily interrupted in May, and it will continue to fall as inflationary pressures wane thanks to easing wage growth, lower energy prices and normalised price expectations. But core inflation remaining stable reminds us that the disinflationary process will be bumpy.\u201d\n\nThe ECB cut its main deposit rate last month to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. It was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years.\n\nHowever, the central bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent, with a robust labour market and resilient wage growth.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Economic growth will bring prosperity to all. This is the mantra that guides the decision-making of the vast majority of politicians, economists and even human rights bodies.\n\nYet the reality \u2013 as detailed in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council this month \u2013 shows that while poverty eradication has historically been promised through the \u201ctrickling down\u201d or \u201credistribution\u201d of wealth, economic growth largely \u201cgushes up\u201d to a privileged few.\n\nIn the past four years alone the world\u2019s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty in 2030 \u2013 the deadline set by the world\u2019s governments to eradicate it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to social protection.\n\nHundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive in a world that has never been wealthier; many are driven to exhaustion in poorly paid, often dangerous jobs to satisfy the needs of the elite and to boost corporate profits. In low-income countries, where significant investment is still required, growth can still serve a useful role. In practice, however, it is often extractive, relying on the exploitation of a cheap workforce and the plundering of natural resources.\n\nConcrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product\n\nThe endless quest for growth at all costs, and the escalating use of the natural resources it demands, is pushing our planet way beyond its limits. Six of the nine \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d \u2013 Earth\u2019s life-support systems \u2013 have already been crossed. For too long, the health of our planet has been sacrificed for inequitable material gain.\n\nOur economies are failing us. We urgently need to look beyond profit, beyond the short term and beyond the interests of the few.\n\nA \u201chuman rights economy\u201d can deliver for people and the planet because it shifts our focus from growth to humanity \u2013 grounding the purpose of the economy in fundamental, universal human values. It offers human rights as a guardrail to keep the economy on track \u2013 meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities and eradicating poverty.\n\nThis proposition is not some fairytale. Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 which tells us nothing about the ecological or social fallout of economic activity.\n\nAnd we need to start valuing what really counts. GDP has no way of accounting for the estimated 16.4bn hours spent every day worldwide on unpaid work, largely carried out by women, that underpins the global economy: caring for children, people with disabilities and older citizens.\n\nUnpaid domestic and care work should be remunerated through paid parental and carers\u2019 leave, included in pension calculations, and supported through access to safe water, sanitation, affordable childcare facilities and other essential services.\n\nFinancing these services while reducing our dependence on GDP growth is achievable through progressive tax policies such as inheritance and wealth taxes, preventing illegal financial flows and tax evasion, and tackling corruption. More effective international cooperation on tax, debt and social protection is also needed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The barriers are real: most people have been led to believe that economic growth equals human progress. Yet a growing movement is rallying against our growth-driven economic model: climate activists, workers and trade unions, scientists and academics, young people, environmental and human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples, progressive economists, and activists fighting inequality, gender disparities and colonialism are speaking out.\n\nAs world leaders prepare to gather for the Summit of the Future in September \u2013 a UN initiative that aims to forge a global consensus around what our future should look like \u2013 this groundswell of support for an alternative vision of progress must be embraced. Without a roadmap for a global economy that protects human rights, including the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the final document leaders agree in New York will continue to lead us down the path to extinction.",

        "title": "Greece introduces \u2018growth-oriented\u2019 six-day working week",
        "body": "Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity.\n\nAfter outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent\u2019s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as \u201cbarbaric\u201d by unions, takes effect from Monday.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy. \u201cWhen almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.\u201d\n\nThe pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation \u2013 part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year \u2013 Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009.\n\nThe six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage.\n\nEither choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work.\n\n\u201cThe nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,\u201d Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. \u201cAnd it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required.\n\nFor opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers\u2019 rights in the name of flexibility.\n\n\u201cIn reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,\u201d said Sotiropoulos. \u201cBetter productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.\u201d\n\nThe measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country\u2019s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff.\n\nTrialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada.\n\nGreeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has frequently decried \u201cBulgarian salaries in a country of British prices\u201d, claiming the phenomenon has only exacerbated the brain drain.\n\nPeople on pensions, who have also been encouraged to work under the legislation, have weighed into the debate.\n\n\u201cWhat the government is essentially saying is \u2018go and work longer, we\u2019ll turn a blind eye even if you\u2019re a pensioner,\u2019\u201d said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the union of retired teachers (Pesek).\n\n\u201cIt knows that the majority of Greeks, on an average monthly salary of \u20ac900, can only survive until the 20th of the month. This latest barbaric measure is not going to solve the fundamental problem of labour shortages and a lot of us feel it is very unfair to unemployed young Greeks who may never have a job.\u201d",

He was then chief economist at the Department of the Environment (1990-94), before becoming head of energy, economics and statistics at the DTI, a post, he liked to point out, once held by Harold Wilson. In 1996, Nick joined the economic consultancy Oxera, from where he was seconded to the Cabinet Office to head up a report on energy policy.\n\nBorn in London, the only child of Nancy (nee Fulton), a dressmaker, and Edward Hartley, a publican, Nick went to St Clement Danes grammar school, Hammersmith, where he and I met in 1955. Sitting side by side in assembly for the headteacher\u2019s address to the new boys, he introduced himself: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Hartley, like the jam.\u201d\n\nIn the sixth form we were told by our economics teacher, Jack Harvey, to apply to St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, to study economics. We arrived in 1962 during a winter so cold that the River Granta froze, and Nick and I would walk on it to Grantchester.\n\nAfter graduating, Nick passed the civil service exam and became assistant principal at the Department for Education, where he worked for JAR Pimlott setting up polytechnics (1965-69). From there, he moved to the Treasury as an economic adviser (1969-84). He was seconded from the Treasury twice, in 1970-71 to do an MPhil at York University, and in 1974-77, to the Royal Commission on the Press.\n\nLatterly he was a companion of the Guild of St George, a charity for arts and crafts founded by John Ruskin who, Nick said, \u201cwas asking all the right questions about the way work and society should be organised\u201d. Nick travelled throughout Italy with Ruskin\u2019s work in mind, and artistic interests were central to his life.\n\nHe wrote several books, including The Prince of Privateers (2012), a life of one of his forebears who was on the British side in the American war of independence, and Monuments Officer (2012), a novel.\n\nAn enthusiastic theatregoer, as an undergraduate he played Lucky in a production of Waiting for Godot. After hearing Bob Dylan\u2019s second album in 1962 he became a lifelong fan of the musician. He was also a keen reader of the magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, so after watching a film at Cambridge, whether Hammer horror or Truffaut, he would give notes on \u201cauteur theory\u201d.\n\nThe novelist and playwright Nigel Williams described Nick as having a \u201cunique brisk theatricality\u201d. Perfect words with which to preserve my own memories of him, particularly as the briskness often involved the sort of expansive gestures that put any wine glasses on a table at risk.\n\nNick is survived by Jenny (nee Stern), whom he married in 1975, and by their sons, Ned and Gabriel, and granddaughters, Violet, Hazel and Hana.",

        "body": "Paul Krugman (How the \u2018unforced error\u2019 of austerity wrecked Britain, 28 June) hits the nail on the head when he says that there was no economic case for the austerity that the coalition government foisted on us in 2010, the effects of which are still with us. It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour.\n\nThe American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned.\n\nProf Roger Brown\n\nSouthampton\n\nPaul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy \u2013 here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too.\n\nSecond, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector\u2019s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector.\n\nAlternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both.\n\nAusterity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we\u2019ve suffered from the consequences ever since.\n\nDave Pollard\n\nLeicester\n\nPaul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy. But in solely blaming the Tories, he neglects to acknowledge the role of the Liberal Democrats in both enabling austerity and even co-authoring the genesis of the policy through the key role played by the then chief secretary to the Treasury David Laws.\n\nAlthough in post for only a short time, his role was pivotal in developing the first drastic cuts in public expenditure. We now live with the consequences of 14 years of monetarist dogma ruthlessly, pitilessly and unfairly applied.\n\nAlan Beynon\n\nBarmby Moor, East Yorkshire",

Boeing has announced the takeover of Spirit Aerosystems as it tries to retake control of its supply chain following a series of production issues. As part of that deal Airbus will take over Spirit operations serving it, including in Belfast which makes wings and fuselages for the small A220 jet. However, the Unite union has said that 40% of the 3,600 workforce is employed on parts that are not related to Airbus projects, including work for Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. Airbus did not say whether it plans to continue that work. Local politicians are concerned that job losses may result at an historic factory that traces its history back to Short Brothers, the first company to make production aircraft. First minister Michelle O\u2019Neill and deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly released statements in which they said the government was working with the company to preserve the Belfast operations. Economy minister Conor Murphy said: \u201cI have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.\u201d Reuters reported: The leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s (DUP) Gavin Robinson, said the sale represented only \u201ca partial solution\u201d. Steve Aiken, a member of the smaller Ulster Unionist Party, said it was an outcome \u201cneither management, workforce or the unions desired\u201d, calling on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy minister to intervene to ensure the entire business is retained. \u201cThe minister also needs to emphasis to Airbus the considerable investment the Northern Irish and UK governments have made in wing and aerostructure manufacturing in Belfast and that we will not be allowing our aircraft industry to be asset stripped and manufacturing moved elsewhere,\u201d Aiken added. Share\n\n4d ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation \u201cremains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

Meta launched a \u201cpay or consent\u201d model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc\u2019s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into \u201cpay or consent\u201d on Monday and found the model \u201cforces users to consent\u201d to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the \u201cwith adverts\u201d versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term \u2013 although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn.

Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share\n\n4d ago 12.59 CEST Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July \u2013 after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite\u2019s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May.

The UK\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May\u2019s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May\u2019s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers\u2019 input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

        "title": "London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump",
        "body": "London\u2019s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.\n\nDemand for investment banking services \u2013 such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds \u2013 was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.\n\nBut the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,\u201d Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.\n\nThat is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of \u201cbulge bracket\u201d firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.\n\n\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s more of a an upswing happening,\u201d the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. \u201cEven if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.\u201d\n\nNaidu said the UK\u2019s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. \u201cWhat might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.\u201d\n\nThere is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.\n\nDartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.\n\nWhile lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of \u00a344,267 in 2023 \u2013 marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier \u2013 mid-tier associates\u2019 bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to \u00a380,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to \u00a3213,940.\n\nMeanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to \u00a3135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to \u00a3303,204.\n\nThe survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers \u2013 working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America \u2013 found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.\n\nBut even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Macron\u2019s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 \u2013 an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.\n\nIf it forms a government, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn) for the rest of this year and \u20ac12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.\n\nThe left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.\n\nThe turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany\u2019s rising to its highest level since 2012.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The big three \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP Paribas and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u2013 are down 10%-14% since Macron\u2019s announcement.\n\nFrench banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.\n\nThe positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.\n\n\u201cCompared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,\u201d the former Mexican central bank governor said.\n\nAlthough Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.\n\nHe described an \u201cextreme\u201d scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further.

The financial data of one of the world\u2019s largest makers of emblems and patches \u2013 privately held World Emblem \u2013 can\u2019t be easily obtained. But the company\u2019s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing it,\u201d says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there would be.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s underwear\n\nAsk any guy about underwear, and they\u2019ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we\u2019re buying the good material. When money\u2019s tight, we\u2019re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men\u2019s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some \u2013 including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan \u2013 think so. If you want to check out how the men\u2019s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. \u201cBottom\u201d line: men\u2019s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.\n\nLipstick\n\nFor the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don\u2019t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that\u2019s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.\n\nOverseas freight\n\nWorld shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They\u2019re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs \u2013 a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how\u2019s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America\u2019s largest makers of these vehicles \u2013 Winnebago \u2013 not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company\u2019s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.\n\nI\u2019m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men\u2019s underwear you can also track women\u2019s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.\n\nGoofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I\u2019ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.",

        "body": "Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.\n\nAssuming the polls are right \u2013 and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign \u2013 the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.\n\nBut in 1906, Arthur Balfour\u2019s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour\u2019s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue \u2013 free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.\n\nNews on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that\u2019s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.\n\nLiving standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income \u2013 a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account \u2013 rose by 2.4% over the past year.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don\u2019t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.\n\nOnly twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.\n\nIn the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.\n\nAs it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.\n\nOther recent developments \u2013 especially those overseas \u2013 are not so welcome. Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.\n\nMeanwhile, the first round of voting in France\u2019s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen\u2019s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government.\n\nEvents in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.\n\nGlobalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures \u2013 not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.\n\nThe developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.\n\nSo those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation \u2013 the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis \u2013 when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.\n\nAnd an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.",

        "body": "Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.\n\n\u201cMy friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.\u201d\n\nVanessa\u2019s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the \u201cplummeting mental health of young people\u201d, she says. \u201cPut these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.\u201d\n\nHer decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.\n\nThese factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates \u2013 the number of children born to each woman.\n\nWhile the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.\n\nHere we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.\n\nHow the UK is affected\n\nThe total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nAs a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the \u201creplacement rate\u201d, often known as the \u201cR-rate\u201d, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.\n\nIt has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.\n\nAnn Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: \u201cThe Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.\u201d\n\nThe trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.\n\nThis figure is not an all-time low because the UK\u2019s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.\n\nBut when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.\n\nAccording to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday \u2013 the first generation for which that is true.\n\nIt\u2019s the economy \u2026\n\nWhen the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.\n\nHannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.\n\nChildcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. \u201cThe family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.\u201d She and her partner are considering moving abroad.\n\nIn the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries \u2013 under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France \u2013 arrested declines over previous decades.\n\nIn the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK \u2019s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.\n\nFor all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,\u201d says the report.\n\n\u201cIn other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.\u201d\n\nTo measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan\u2019s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy\u2019s 1.2 and South Korea\u2019s 0.8.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fiona Powley, a trainer and facilitator who runs Bristol Childfree Women.\n\nThe consultancy\u2019s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.\n\n\u2026 but also other factors\n\nRecent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.\n\nBerrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was \u201ca lot of uncertainty in the answers\u201d. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.\n\nFiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, \u201cthey talk about time and freedom: finances don\u2019t usually feature\u201d.\n\nShe adds: \u201cA common judgment from others asks \u2018who will look after you when you\u2019re old?\u2019, to which most members might say they\u2019ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they\u2019ve not have the financial strain of children.\u201d\n\nSarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it might explain why traditional South Korea\u2019s fertility rate is so low.\n\n\u201cThese days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and \u2018I\u2019m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down\u2019,\u201d says Harper, who advised the David Cameron\u2019s government on the implications of an ageing society.\n\nPublic services\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.\n\nIn a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, \u201cthe size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.\n\n\u201cThe age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,\u201d it said.\n\nAt the moment, the UK population is increasing \u2013 by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years \u2013 but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.\n\nWithout a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.\n\nSchools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to \u00a31bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.\n\nAccording to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.\n\nPrimary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.\n\nPupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.\n\nLooking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.\n\nWhat about ageing?\n\nPlenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?\n\nNik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.\n\n\u201cOne way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio \u2013 the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,\u201d he says. \u201cThis reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.\u201d\n\nJust as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.\n\nHarper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.\n\n\u201cMen in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,\u201d she says. \u201cMen who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won\u2019t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.\u201d\n\nHarper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.\n\nGiven that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people\u2019s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.\n\nBerrington says the implications for policymaking are \u201cvery significant \u2013 for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. \u201cPolicy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.\u201d\n\nPronatalist policies \u2013 those that attempt to boost the birthrate \u2013 are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.\n\nA report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. \u201cWe do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct \u2018population strategy\u2019 to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,\u201d it said.\n\nBerrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cAnd governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons \u2013 poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children \u2013 have relatively high inactivity rates.\u201d",
        "summary": "These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates \u2013 the number of children born to each woman.\nWhile the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world.\nJapan\u2019s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy\u2019s 1.2 and South Korea\u2019s 0.8.\nHowever, it might explain why traditional South Korea\u2019s fertility rate is so low.\nPlenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer.",

        "title": "Labour needs billions to fund its plans \u2013 and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton",
        "body": "Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things \u2013 nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head \u2013 have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.\n\nThe seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism\u2019s approach to wealth generation \u2013 trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly \u201ccrowds out\u201d suppressed investment and enterprise \u2013 is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off \u2013 and transforming Labour into Britain\u2019s natural party of government.\n\nHis first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not \u201ccrowd out\u201d investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while \u201ccrowding in\u201d innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices \u2013 the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.\n\nThis is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as \u00a3100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by \u00a3100bn every year \u2013 the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors \u2013 while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.\n\nOne important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the \u00a31.4tn funds fossilised in Britain\u2019s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers\u2019 final year\u2019s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a \u00a31.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks \u2013 and the money made to work to accelerate Britain\u2019s investment recovery.\n\nThere is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour\u2019s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth \u00a333bn with a \u00a312bn investment surplus \u2013 one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another \u00a3600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.\n\nThe first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least \u00a3100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves should lift the facility to \u00a350bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to \u00a310bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth \u2013 without additional direct government borrowing. It\u2019s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nAgainst this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK\u2019s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped \u00a328bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.\n\nIn the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves\u2019 Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.\n\nSome in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.",

The Labour leader is expected to become prime minister later today.\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s party is on track to record its worst ever performance in a general election.\n\nAs the results are broadly as expected and already priced into financial markets, the pound held steady. It is up 0.1% against the dollar at $1.2770, and against the euro at \u20ac1.18.\n\nThe London Chamber of Commerce said the business community looks forward to a \u201cfresh start\u201d under Labour.\n\nChief executive Karim Fatehi said:\n\nWe look forward to working with government over the coming years to build a London where businesses of all sizes thrive. Now is the time for the new government to quickly make the changes businesses need to succeed. As laid out in our manifesto this includes the introduction of policies that protect and support the capital\u2019s businesses, enhance London\u2019s international competitiveness, and simplify and enable infrastructure and planning. These policies will lay the foundations for future growth, address long term skills shortages, and foster greater innovation in our capital.\n\nThe CBI business group said \u201cbusiness stands ready to bring its innovation, ideas, and investment to make that shared mission a reality\u201d.\n\nRain Newton-Smith, CBI\u2019s chief executive, said:\n\nThe new prime minister has been given a clear mandate to take the tough decisions on areas like planning reform and boosting grid capacity needed to get the economy firing on all cylinders. What firms need now is a government that\u2019s ready to hit the ground running and is laser-focused on delivery. Households and businesses across the UK have shown incredible resilience through Brexit, Covid and war in Europe. With the economy picking up steam, now is the moment to get behind growth. Setting out a positive vision for the UK economy and leaning into our international leadership should be top priorities for the first 100 days.\n\nThe TUC said Labour has a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d to \u201crepair and rebuild Britain\u201d.\n\nThe union\u2019s general secretary Paul Nowak said:\n\nThe trade union movement stands ready to work with this new government to deliver the change working families desperately need. This means tackling the scourge of insecure work and boosting living standards. It means fixing our crumbling public services. And it means reversing over a decade of Tory stagnation with a proper plan for growth and industrial revival.\n\nAnd this is the country following 14 years of Conservative rule:\n\nThe Agenda\n\n7am BST: Halifax house price index for June\n\n7am BST: German industrial production for May\n\n7.45am BST: France trade and industrial production for May\n\n10m BST: Eurozone retail sales for May\n\n1.30pm BST: US non-farm payrolls for June (forecast: +190,000), unemployment rate (forecast: unchanged at 4%)",

        "body": "16h ago 15.34 CEST Energy commodity trading in muted reaction to prospect of Labour victory Jillian Ambrose The muted market reaction to the prospect of a Labour party victory in the UK\u2019s general election is evident even in energy commodity markets today, where traders are not expecting to be caught out by any surprises. \u201cElection results look quite certain,\u201d one trader told the Guardian. \u201cCommodity traders won\u2019t be working past 5pm.\u201d The potential for Labour\u2019s manifesto points to translate into price movements appears limited, according to Robbie Jackson-Stroud, an analyst at commodities data provider ICIS. Jackson-Stroud said that any policies designed to spur the development and construction of new energy capacity requires time to agree upon at a policy level, as well as planning and then construction. He added that \u201ccost constraints in the current climate are the driver of investment in renewable capacity, and a change of party does not shift that.\u201d But the commodity market\u2019s underwhelming response to a potential Labour government has had one exception: the UK\u2019s market for carbon credits. Traders have placed record bets that the price of UK carbon allowances, known as UKAs, would rise on the basis that a future Labour government would bring in tougher climate policies making it more expensive to pollute. \u201cUKA prices have already rallied on expectation of improved green policies and the possibility that the UK\u2019s carbon market may link with the EU market under a Labour government,\u201d the trader said. The benchmark UKA price climbed to highs of \u00a350 a tonne in the weeks after the election was announced, from lows of \u00a331 a tonne earlier this year. On Thursday the price reached an intra-day high of \u00a346.30 a tonne. Share\n\n16h ago 15.17 CEST The 4.2% drop in the Novo Nordisk share price this week has wiped nearly \u00a315bn off its market value, reducing it to \u00a3370bn. The success of its weight loss treatments has turned it into Denmark\u2019s, and Europe\u2019s, most valuable company. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis has also looked at the eye study. Whilst the paper in question does indeed suggest some correlation with a rare ocular event, the quality of the evidence is very low, the error bars are very wide, we note the lack of prior identification suggests this would be a relatively rare issue (far rarer than stats in this paper would imply\u2026) and the worst case scenario would likely be a further update to the label warning section \u2013 hardly a game-changer. As an aside, we also remain relaxed on the pricing outlook, within the context of the damage that has already been done by the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. Share Updated at 15.17 CEST\n\n16h ago 15.01 CEST Shares in Novo Nordisk, and US rival Eli Lilly, have also come under pressure after Joe Biden attacked the company\u2019s pricing for weight loss drugs this week. The companies are charging \u201cunconscionably high prices\u201d that are above those paid in other countries, Biden wrote in an editorial with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders published in USA Today on Tuesday. If \u201cpharmaceutical companies refuse to substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country and end their greed, we will do everything within our power to end it for them,\u201d they wrote. Share Updated at 15.02 CEST\n\n17h ago 14.23 CEST Novo Nordisk shares fall 4.2% after eye study Shares in Novo Nordisk, the maker of the bestselling diabetes and weight loss injections Ozempic and Wegovy, have fallen more than 4% this week, after a study suggested that there could be a link between those treatments and vision loss. The shares are down 4.2% so far this week, but have somewhat recovered to trade 0.8% higher today. People who have been prescribed a weight-loss injection could be at a higher risk of developing an eye condition which can lead to blindness, the study found. The study, published yesterday, found that people with diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide, most commonly known under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, were more than four times more likely to be diagnosed with an eye condition known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (naion). Naion is a disorder in which the arteries which supply blood to the optic nerve in the eye become blocked. The condition can lead to loss of eyesight due to the optic nerve being deprived of oxygen and subsequently damaged. There is no known treatment for the condition, which affects 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population. Weight-loss jabs may be linked to condition that can cause blindness, study finds Read more Jakob Westh Christensen, market analyst at eToro said Considering that over 50% of Novo Nordisk\u2019s sales are attributed to these two blockbuster drugs and with a promising projected growth trajectory, any significant issues with the drugs could pose a threat to earnings and stock prices. However, the relatively minor market reaction indicates that investors are not overly concerned about this initial study. With a high valuation at nearly 40 times pprice/earnings, it is evident that the market has great expectations for Novo Nordisk\u2019s earnings growth in the year ahead. This growth is largely based on their GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss treatments, which are currently under scrutiny. This growth journey is supported by yet another uplift to management\u2019s 2024 outlook in connection with Q1-results, which now expects operating profit to grow 22-30%. However, it is important to note that this study is relatively small and has limited statistical power. The findings do not prove that the medications caused the eye complications, which are commonly associated with diabetes. To establish any connection properly, a much larger study must be conducted. As retail investors who hold Novo Nordisk stock, it is advisable to monitor this situation closely. Any significant threat to these highly successful drugs would constitute a significant setback to Novo Nordisk\u2019s growth journey. Share Updated at 15.11 CEST\n\n17h ago 13.51 CEST Russ Mould at AJ Bell has also looked at the medical equipment maker Smith & Nephew, Andy Murray\u2019s artificial hipmaker, which is leading FTSE 100 gains here in London. The shares jumped more than 8% after the activist investor Cevian Capital, a Swedish investment firm, disclosed a stake of around 5%. Activist investors often circle a struggling company so the news Sweden\u2019s Cevian has taken a stake in medical devices firm Smith & Nephew shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise. Cevian has previously taken positions in UBS, Vodafone and Aviva in an attempt to force change and the case for doing so at Smith & Nephew is presented by a near-40% decline in the share price over the last five years. Ian Cowie, columnist at the Sunday Times and interactive investor, said on X: Bargain Britain: Activist Investor Cevian Takes Stake in Smith & Nephew, Andy Murray\u2019s artificial hip-maker. Share price jumps for joy! https://t.co/MdiYfDwi4F \u2014 Ian Cowie (@iancowie) July 4, 2024 The positive share price reaction to Cevian taking a position in Smith & Nephew demonstrates the market thinks an outside catalyst for a shake-up of the business would be no bad thing. The company was severely affected by the pandemic as elective procedures like hip and knee replacements were cancelled, reducing demand for its orthopaedic products. Lockdown also hit the company\u2019s supply chain, as it did for many businesses. However, its post-Covid recovery has been faltering and an improvement plan announced in 2022 has not yet resulted in a material improvement in earnings and profitability. This hasn\u2019t been helped by a weak showing in the US market. Cevian is likely to hold management\u2019s feet to the fire and may look for more ambitious targets than set out under the existing improvement plan. It could also push for a rationalisation of the company\u2019s portfolio, which encompasses sports medicine and wound care alongside orthopaedics.

Photograph: Stephen Dwyer/Alamy Share Updated at 14.13 CEST\n\n17h ago 13.47 CEST Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, has looked at today\u2019s market moves. The FTSE 100 index has gained 80 points to 8251, up nearly 1% on the day, while European shares are also pushing higher. France\u2019s CAC has climbed 0.8% ahead of the second round of elections on Sunday. The FTSE 100 made a strong start on election day but its gains had far more to do with events on the other side of the Atlantic. Broad-based gains across the index followed weak jobs data from the US and a soft reading from the country\u2019s services sector. This was taken as an indication the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates sooner rather than later, with the labour market closely watched by Jerome Powell and his colleagues. The dollar fell which, along with the shifting rate expectations, helped power Asian markets to big gains, with one broad-based Asian index reaching its highest level in more than two years. Dominant regional name Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company traded above one thousand Taiwanese dollars for the first time. Closer to home, there was some relief that mainstream parties appeared to be mounting a concerted effort to thwart the far-right Rassemblement National\u2019s hopes of gaining a majority in the French parliament. Share\n\n17h ago 13.44 CEST Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at the trading platform Capital.com, said if we get a government change after 14 years of Tory leadership as suggested by opinion polls, \u201cthe market reaction is likely to be slightly muted given the outcome is mostly priced in\u201d. The majority of the momentum will come from investors\u2019 perception that the Labour Party can keep to its pledge to keep a lid on public spending and manage the national debt while putting the country back on the path towards stable economic growth. In particular, the plans to increase the supply of housing could benefit FTSE 100-listed housing stocks (Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group, etc.). Turning to the pound, she said: Barring any surprises which could bring volatility to markets, the pound may attempt to build on the pre-election rally of the last two days. But it is likely that it encounters resistance up ahead, especially as the focus remains on the Bank of England and its policy mandate, which has given no clear signs of when it will be able to start cutting rates. Markets are hopeful of a September start, but ongoing concerns about wage pressures in the services sector are keeping the central bank from making a move just yet. How these policy expectations evolve will likely have a bigger impact on the pound in the coming weeks than the election. Overall, the momentum in UK assets should not change much after the UK general election if things go as planned. As we\u2019ve seen from the political turmoil in France, the less political friction there is the better the market will react. There is no denying that a new government will face significant challenges up ahead and that can weigh on UK assets further down the line, but for now, a seemingly calm election should anchor UK stocks and keep the pound relatively calm. Share\n\n18h ago 13.03 CEST UK employers scale back expected wage growth, Bank of England says Employers in the UK expect their wage bills to grow more slowly over the coming 12 months, according to a survey that should give the Bank of England more confidence to cut interest rates in the next few months. The central bank\u2019s own Decision Maker Panel survey showed anticipated year-ahead wage growth fell by 0.3 percentage points to 4.2% in the three months to June. It was the lowest reading since the survey started in May 2022. The official measure of earnings growth has been too high for policymakers\u2019 liking, and also fed into stubbornly high services inflation. But this survey suggests that wage growth could cool in the coming months. Share\n\n19h ago 12.34 CEST EU trade chief: no basis for China to retaliate to new EV tariffs There is no basis for China to retaliate, as the European Union prepares to impose fresh tariffs of up to 37.6% on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said today, in an interview with Bloomberg News. The EU tariffs, which range between 17.4% and 37.6%, will apply from tomorrow, according to EU officials. They are aimed at stemming what European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has described as a flood of cheap Chinese-made EVs built with state subsidies. However, there is a four-month window during which the duties are only provisional and intense talks are expected to continue between the two sides. At the end of the period, the Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, could impose \u201cdefinite duties\u201d that typically apply for five years, on which EU members would vote. Dombrovskis said: Our aim is to\u2026 ensure fair competition and level playing field. Therefore, once again, we do not see any basis for retaliation. Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs. The provisional rates are almost exactly those announced by the Commission on 12 June. Beijing said at the time that it would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to safeguard China\u2019s interests. These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of European products such as cognac and pork. EU to put tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles as trade war looms Read more Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker, is opposed to the tariffs. It said: The timing of the EU Commission\u2019s decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEVs [battery electric vehicles] in Germany and Europe. The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group is confidently accepting growing international competition, including from China, and sees this as an opportunity \u2013 this also benefits our customers. The owner of the Jeep, Fiat and Vauxhall brands, Stellantis, has also come out against the proposed tariffs. Its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has criticised the duties and said the world\u2019s fourth biggest carmaker preferred to \u201cfight to stay competitive\u201d. The Shanghai-based electric carmaker Nio said: At this stage, Nio maintains the pricing of its current models in its European markets. however, it cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed. Despite these developments, Nio is fully committed to the European market: we believe in fostering competition and consumer interest, and we hope to reach a resolution with the EU before definitive measures are enforced in November.

The decline in the ISM services index to 48.8 in June, from 53.8, takes it to its lowest since the lockdowns in 2020. Alongside a decline in the ISM manufacturing index, these surveys suggest that GDP growth will remain weak in the third quarter. They also add to evidence that labour demand is softening, and inflation will remain on a downward trend.

Leading the growth rankings for a second month running was the financials sector, where the rate of expansion in output picked up again to the sharpest since the end of 2021. Although returning to contraction territory for the second time in the last three months, technology firms recorded only a fractional drop in output in June. It was, nonetheless, the worst performing of the seven sectors. In contrast, the healthcare sector returned to growth in June, as output rose for the first time since March. Moreover, the rate of expansion in business activity was solid and the sharpest so far this year. The consumer goods and consumer services sectors saw differing trends during June, as growth in the latter accelerated to the fastest for two years. Meanwhile, consumer goods firms recorded the slowest upturn in output over the past six months. The basic materials sector saw an acceleration in the pace of output growth during June. Production levels rose at a solid rate that was the second-quickest since April 2022 (behind that seen in March 2024). Share\n\n2d ago 15.59 CEST US service sector growth picks up \u2013 S&P Global The US service sector picked up momentum in June, with the biggest rise in new orders in a year. Companies responded by taking on more staff for the first time in three months, but even so backlogs of work built up. Price pressures from both input costs and output prices eased in June, but remained above pre-pandemic averages, mainly because of higher labour costs. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US services PMI business activity index increased for the second month running in June, to 55.3 from 54.8 in May. Activity in the sector has now risen in each of the past 17 months, with the latest expansion the most pronounced since April 2022. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: US service sector companies reported an encouragingly solid end to the second quarter, with output rising at the fastest rate for over two years. Both new order inflows and hiring have also accelerated, the latter buoyed by firms taking on more workers in response to rising backlogs of work. With additional \u2013 albeit more muted \u2013 support coming from the manufacturing sector, the survey data point to GDP rising at an annualised 2.0% rate in the second quarter, with a 2.5% rate seen for June. Forward momentum is therefore gathering pace. There is some nervousness creeping in regarding the post-election business environment, but for now at least confidence about the outlook for the coming year remains elevated by recent standards and supportive of businesses investing in expansion. Some of this optimism relates to ongoing convictions that interest rates will start to fall before the end of the year. In this respect, a further cooling of price pressures in the survey \u2013 notably in the services sector \u2013 adds to signs that inflation should trend lower in the coming months to open the door further for rate cuts. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST\n\n2d ago 15.48 CEST Baillie Gifford-run trust sells Rio Tinto stake An investment trust run by Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford has sold its \u00a320m stake in Rio Tinto, accusing the mining giant of not doing enough to tackle environmental and social concerns. Disclosure of the disposal by the FTSE 250-listed Monks Investment Trust, first reported by the Times, comes weeks after Baillie Gifford came under pressure from environmental activists in a row that led to it pulling out of sponsoring the Hay Edinburgh and other book festivals. Baillie Gifford pulled out after calls by campaign group Fossil Free Books (FFB) for the company to divest from fossil fuels and companies linked to Israel. Nine festivals that were previously sponsored by Baillie Gifford are now seeking donations, we reported earlier this week. Monks said on Tuesday that it would sell shares in companies that are not making enough progress on environmental, social and governance factors and named the mining group as a company it had ditched. Karl Sternberg, chair of Monks, said \u201cconcerns regarding governance and the approach to environmental impact\u201d had not been \u201cadequately addressed\u201d by the world\u2019s second-largest mining group. Monks first voiced concerns over Rio Tinto after it bulldozed a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal site in Western Australia in 2020. The scandal triggered the departure of both Rio Tinto\u2019s chief executive and chair. Share\n\n2d ago 15.20 CEST US trade deficit widens slightly, labour market data softer US trade data and labour market figures are out. The trade deficit widened slightly to $75.1bn in May from $74.5bn, as exports fell by 0.7% month on month, countering a 0.3% decline in imports. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: Nevertheless, the decline in exports was more modest than the advance goods data had implied, so net external demand should now be a slightly smaller (albeit still sizeable) drag on second-quarter GDP growth. Factoring in the disappointing May construction spending data released yesterday too, we now estimate that GDP growth was 1.9% annualised \u2013 a little stronger than the first quarter, but well below the economy\u2019s immigration-boosted potential growth rate. The $3.1bn decline in goods exports was driven by a $2.1bn drop in industrial supplies, which was partly linked to the fall in energy prices. The $1.9bn decline in goods imports was more than explained by a $4.2bn fall in pharmaceutical drugs, which tend to be quite volatile on a month-to-month basis. For the second quarter as a whole, we estimate that exports declined by 0.8% annualised, with imports up by 8.3%. The latest labour market data still look a little softer ahead of key June payrolls figures, due on Friday. ADP employment increased by a muted 150,000, and initial jobless claims edged up to 238,000, from 236,000. Alongside the news that GDP growth remained lacklustre in the first half of this year, this new-found labour market softness is a little disconcerting. Share\n\n2d ago 14.41 CEST Oil prices hit two-month high ahead of summer driving season Oil prices have climbed to a two-month high, ahead of the summer driving season, and amid renewed tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose as high as $86.83 a barrel today, and is now trading at $86.41 a barrel, up 0.2% on the day. It has gained nearly $10 a barrel since the start of June. US light crude touched $83.36 a barrel and is now 0.2% higher at $82.97 a barrel, after pushing through $84 yesterday for the first time since April. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Oil prices are ticking upwards again, following a drop in US crude stockpiles for the week ending 28 June. Demand for fuel to power trips over the US holiday season is expected to be high. But traders are also eyeing potential supply constraints. Geo-political escalation in the Middle East is still a threat, given the ongoing violence in Gaza. The hurricane season forecast to be particularly fierce this year, given the devastation wreaked on the Caribbean this week and if severe storms hit the Gulf Coast, refining capacity could be significantly disrupted.

Syncona, a London-based life science investor that is listed on the FTSE 250, committed \u00a333.5m to the Series B financing, resulting in a \u00a314.1m uplift in its valuation of Beacon. (Series B financing is the second round of funding for a business through investment.) Syncona launched Beacon last year, after taking advantage of challenging biotech market conditions to acquire Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation off Nasdaq in 2022, and combining it with other pre-clinical programmes, including from the University of Oxford. Beacon, headquartered in London with another base in Massachusetts, focuses on developing gene therapies for both rare and prevalent diseases of the eye that lead to blindness, including X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Beacon\u2019s lead asset in XLRP is currently in intermediate to late-stage clinical trials. Share Updated at 14.11 CEST\n\n2d ago 12.47 CEST Eli Lilly's Kisunla is second Alzheimer's drug to get FDA approval The approval of Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla drug by the US health regulator means competition is heating up in the Alzheimer\u2019s drug market, analysts say. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday approved the experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug donanemab, marketed as Kisunla, for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody slowed the early stages of the fatal mind-robbing disease in studies. It is the second disease-modifying therapy to reach the AD market in the US, after Eisai/Biogen\u2019s Leqembi (Lecanemab) received full FDA approval last July. Philippa Salter, managing neurology analyst at the data and analytics firm GlobalData, forecast that Leqembi and Kisunla could generate global (US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan and China) sales of around $3.5bn and $2bn by 2030, respectively. She said: Despite gaining approval nearly a year ago, uptake of Leqembi has been slow. While the approval of Kisunla will provide further confidence [in this type of treatments], which could help drive the uptake of both drugs, many of the challenges faced by Leqembi will also apply to Kisunla. Both drugs require brain scans before treatment, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to assess levels of amyloid in the brain, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, with further MRI scans recommended prior to further drug infusions. She said access to these scans is a \u201ckey limiting factor for the uptake of these drugs\u201d. View image in fullscreen The Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla on Tuesday, for mild or early cases of dementia caused by Alzheimer\u2019s. Photograph: AP Salter explained: The MRIs help monitor for a known side effect of these drugs, the development of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs). The rates of ARIA were lower in Leqembi\u2019s Phase III trials compared to Kisunla\u2019s Phase III trials, giving Leqembi a key advantage in its safety profile. However, an important competitive advantage for Kisunla is its once-monthly dosing schedule compared with Leqembi\u2019s dosing of once every two weeks. Further, despite having a higher annual cost of therapy of $32,000 for Kisunla compared with $26,500 per year for Leqembi, Lilly states that in the long term, Kisunla will be cheaper and more convenient for patients since they won\u2019t have to take the drug indefinitely, something that was included in the FDA label, which states that once amyloid plaques have been reduced to minimal levels on PET imaging, stopping treatment can be considered. While there are clear advantages in not having to take a drug indefinitely, many questions have been raised about what happens once donanemab therapy is stopped. Further real-world evidence and clinical trial data will be key for physicians to feel confident in stopping treatment with Kisunla and therefore vital for the success of the drug.

Vodafone is seeking to acquire Three UK in a deal which is currently being probed by competition regulators, but many aspects of the new network sharing agreement are independent of the outcome of the Vodafone UK and Three UK merger. The agreement will see a combined Vodafone UK and Three UK commit to invest \u00a311bn in its network for the next decade \u2013 although this will be subject to regulatory approval of the deal \u2013 as well as Virgin Media\u2019s \u00a32bn annual investment in its network. The two operators have agreed subject to completion of the merger, Virgin Media O2 will acquire spectrum from the newly enlarged Vodafone and Three UK group establishing three scaled mobile network operators each with better alignment of spectrum holding. Ahmed Essam, chief executive of European markets at Vodafone, said: With this agreement and our merger with Three, we will transform the mobile experience for over 50m customers in the UK for the long-term, providing significant network improvements including more choice, better quality and greater coverage across the country. Lutz Sch\u00fcler, chief executive of Virgin Media O2, said: We are extending and bolstering elements of our existing network sharing arrangement,while also ensuring there is a robust, balanced and functional structure in place for the long-term should Vodafone and Three\u2019s proposed merger gain consent.

The shares fell as low as 38p and later traded at 39.4p, down 4.2%. Total sales were 6.9% lower year on year in its third quarter, while the UK tile market is down between 10% and 15%, and the company said it was taking market share. Demand for repair, maintenance and improvement has remained weak, especially for bigger projects. Like-for-like sales were 9.7% lower in the third quarter, similar to the 9.2% decline seen in the first half, although sales levels stabilised somewhat through the quarter. Topps said that slowing inflation, a pick-up in real wage growth, improving consumer confidence and increased activity in the housing market \u201cprovides some confidence in a cyclical recovery\u201d. But it cautioned that this recovery is yet to feed through into its market, and it is working to improve its digital offer to trade customers and other measures.

There is growing confidence that a majority for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally can be avoided in the second election round on Sunday, with political wrangling under way. France\u2019s CAC has gained around 1%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is 0.6% higher ahead of tomorrow\u2019s general election, Germany\u2019s Dax is also up by 0.6% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has risen by 1.3%. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at the trading platform Scope Markets, said: With President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist group and a left-wing alliance withdrawing candidates to minimise the number of three-way contests that might split the anti far-right vote, we have seen French [bond] yields head lower and stocks on the rise. With a hung parliament providing the basis for Macron to continue calling the shots, the market perception of a Le Pen victory comes down to the ability to achieve a majority or not. Tomorrow\u2019s UK election looks unlikely to create too many shockwaves given the sheer size of the majority expected for the Labour party. While Reform have been busy chipping away at the Conservative vote, recent scandals will have likely stifled support with two candidates defecting due to perceived racism within the party. For traders, the prospect of a stable Labour majority appears to be a positive, with sterling one of the best performing currencies over the past week. Looking ahead, the US jobs market remains in focus. Yesterday\u2019s JOLTS job openings data showed an unexpected rise counteracted by a downside revision to the May reading. Mahony said: With traders expecting a decline in Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls release, today\u2019s ADP figure looks to similarly head lower in a sign of weakness in the employment picture. The weakness seen for the dollar yesterday came off the back of comments from Powell, with the data dependent nature of the Fed being seen as a positive given the weakness expected in the jobs data this week. Nonetheless, traders will be concerned over the inflationary impact of the recent rise in crude oil, with yesterday\u2019s rise pushing WTI [West Texas Intermediate] through $84 for the first time since April. Share Updated at 14.38 CEST\n\n2d ago 10.44 CEST UK private sector growth at six-month low \u2013 PMI Expansion in the UK services sector slowed further in June with some evidence of a \u201cpre-election seize up\u201d feeding into a wider slowdown across the private sector to a six-month low, according to surveys. More momentum was lost in June, with the upturn at its weakest since last November as tomorrow\u2019s general election prompted some clients to adopt a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach before placing orders and commissioning new projects. New business intakes rose at a historically subdued pace, while the pace of job creation also eased. Meanwhile, firms\u2019 cost pressures continued to cool, but remained elevated. The rate of output price inflation accelerated slightly from May\u2019s recent low. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK services PMI business activity index remained in expansionary territory during June, posting 52.1. While this was the eighth consecutive monthly increase in output across the service sector, the headline index fell again, from 52.9 in May. Activity across the UK\u2019s private sector slowed to a six-month low. The composite output index, which pulls together the manufacturing and services surveys, remained in expansion territory at the end of the second quarter, but the pace of growth in business activity slowed for a second month running to its weakest in 2024 so far. At 52.3, down from 53.0 in May, the index was at a six-month low. Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: We are seeing some evidence of a pre-general election seize up across the UK services economy, with growth in business activity slowing to a seven-month low in June as the prospect of a change in government led to the adoption of a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach by some, restraining sales. Nevertheless, we\u2019re on track for another quarter of GDP growth, according to composite PMI data for the three months to June, albeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter\u2019s 0.7%. Turning to prices and firms\u2019 costs, he said: Prices still continue to show a high degree of stickiness across the UK service sector, although input cost inflation once again trended lower in June. The direction of travel here is encouraging for the Bank of England, but our survey\u2019s gauge of prices charged actually rose on the month as some companies noted their pricing power was strong enough to raise their fees. While costs, mostly from wages, have been the major driving force behind strong services inflation, the recovery of the UK economy from it\u2019s late-2023 lull adds another dynamic for policymakers to consider should stronger economic conditions motivate more companies to raise their prices.

It finished the day down 6.6%.\n\nThe filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which lists Gill as the reporting person, included a section \u201cCheck the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat\u201d under which the descriptor \u201cI am not a cat\u201d was checked.\n\nThe SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock\u2019s Friday closing price of $27.24.

The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.\n\nKrishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: \u201cThe vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.\n\nDales adds:\n\nIt now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.",

Tap here\n\nThe pound is being traded in the Asia-Pacific region at this time of day, albeit in weak volumes and not aided by the fact that the new trading day followed a US public holiday that meant Wall Street was closed.\n\nSterling was initially steady against its main competitors, such as the dollar and euro.\n\nMarket analysts said that was because a big win for Labour was widely expected and therefore \"priced in\", as the jargon goes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pound was up on the day versus the US currency at $1.27 but that was largely explained, they added, by the dollar weakening rather than any growth in support for the pound.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:34 Public service cuts under both Labour and Tories - thinktank\n\nIt did make up some ground versus the euro to trade at \u20ac1.18 after the exit poll was published.\n\nMichael Metcalfe, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, said: \"Having been very negative of sterling for a very long time, institutional investors are actually going into this election quite neutral.\n\nThat was partly, he said, because political risk has surged in the likes of France, which holds the second round of its parliamentary elections in three days' time, and in the United States ahead of its presidential vote in November.\n\n\"The UK, oddly, has ended up with a neutral position in the middle,\" Metcalfe said. \"Also, I don't think at any point has the result (of the election) been in any doubt.\"\n\nBoth the FTSE 100 and domestically-focused FTSE 250 ended Thursday's trading in positive territory, up by 0.9% and 0.3% respectively - in line with other European market performances.\n\nIn the wake of the exit poll being known, trading platform IG saw the FTSE 100 opening Friday's session 0.4% higher.

        "title": "Why French election results matter more to financial markets than the UK vote",
        "body": "Forget the UK general election.\n\nThe poll that financial markets will be watching most closely over the next few days is the second round parliamentary 'run-off' in France this Sunday.\n\nThe French poll is unpredictable, to say the least.\n\nThe first round of voting last week raised the prospect of a hung parliament and prompted a relief rally in French assets on Monday this week.\n\nMarkets would prefer a hung parliament because Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National (RN or National Rally) and the New Popular Front (NPF) - an alliance of the far-left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialists - both want to raise taxes and public spending aggressively.\n\nBut uncertainty remains in the air as the NPF and French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble (Together) alliance scramble to prevent a triumph for RN.\n\nWhat next in French voting?\n\nUnder French electoral rules, where no candidate won outright in the first round of voting, a second round \"run-off\" is held between the two best-placed candidates and any other candidates who garnered more than 12.5% of the vote during the first round. Whoever gets the most votes in the second round wins.\n\nAccordingly, both the NPF and Ensemble have been standing down the majority of candidates in seats where they finished third last time - in the hope their supporters will vote tactically to keep out the RN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 14:41 French elections: Who are National Rally?\n\nLe Monde, the second best-selling newspaper in France, reported yesterday that 224 candidates have withdrawn.\n\nTactical questions\n\nThe tactic may not work, however, not least because the conservative Les Republicains - the party of former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy and which won 10.2% of the votes last Sunday - has given no such guidance to its supporters and could thus split the anti-RN vote.\n\nMoreover, a lot of liberal and conservative voters will be reluctant to vote for the NPF candidate when they come from France Unbowed, led by the 72-year-old left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who is often characterised as a French version of Jeremy Corbyn and who put together the alliance.\n\nEdouard Philippe, Mr Macron's former prime minister, has urged Ensemble's candidates to step down where they were in third place during the first round and get behind centre-right or centre-left candidates - but not candidates from RN or France Unbowed.\n\nA nervous watch\n\nLe Monde estimates that, of the remaining contests, some 409 will now be decided by a two-way duel. There are 89 three-way contests and two four-way battles.\n\nWith the RN expected by pollsters to get anything between 250 and 300 seats in the National Assembly - 289 is required for a majority and it came first in 296 seats in the first round - that has left markets watching nervously.\n\nEver since Mr Macron stunned Europe on 10 June by calling a parliamentary election, after Ensemble suffered a spanking in the European parliamentary election, investors have been rattled by the prospect of either RN or the NPF winning a parliamentary majority.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nMarket reactions so far\n\nThe CAC-40, the leading French stock index, fell by more than 6.5% between 10 June and last Friday - the final day before the first round of voting.\n\nSome individual stocks have fallen by more, though, with the banks Societe Generale and Credit Agricole down 10% and 7% respectively since Mr Macron called the election. The construction-to-telecoms conglomerate Bouygues has also fallen by 10% and Vinci, the construction and infrastructure services group which owns the UK civil engineer Taylor Woodrow, is down by more than 7.5%.\n\nThere has also been a sell-off in French government bonds - reflecting concerns that a high-spending RN or NPF government would increase borrowing.\n\nThe yield (bond yields rise as the price falls) on 10-year French government bonds jumped from 3.118% on the day before Mr Macron called the election to as much as 3.373% on Tuesday this week.\n\nAnd the premium that investors demand for holding 10-year French government bonds over their German equivalent surged from 47.61 basis points (0.4761%) before Mr Macron called the election to as much as 85.2 basis points (0.852%) last Friday - a sharp and pronounced move highlighting the anxiety of investors and taking the spread to its widest in 12 years.\n\nA French-style mini-budget moment?\n\nIt has led some investment analysts to speculate that France could suffer its own mini-budget moment - where bond investors sell the government's debt for fear of extra borrowing surging out of control.\n\nThe uncertainty has even spilled over to the Euro, which has fallen from $1.09 just before the European elections to as low as $1.067 in the days after Mr Macron called the snap poll, although it has since rallied to around $1.079.\n\nSome analysts now argue French assets represent good value, assuming the second round of voting produces a hung parliament or a modest majority for the RN, which is regarded as a more market-friendly outcome than a victory for the NPF.\n\nMarina Zavolock and Regiane Yamanari, strategists at Morgan Stanley, told clients today: \"We believe the two key remaining French election scenarios - no majority and RN absolute majority - would both ultimately be followed by a recovery in French and wider-European equities indices.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nAlready existing concerns\n\nBut there are still widespread concerns - and so serious are they that the European Central Bank has even faced questions this week at its annual Central Banking Forum in Sintra, Portugal, over whether it would be prepared to intervene in the markets, if necessary, to prop up French government bonds.\n\nFrance is already under a so-called \"excessive deficit procedure\" with the European Commission for running a budget deficit of 5% of GDP - well ahead of the 3% limit led out by the Maastricht Treaty. That was already putting it on a potential collision course with Brussels in the event of a victory for either the RN or the NPF.\n\nSome leeway 'because it's France'\n\nFrance has traditionally enjoyed a certain amount of leeway from Brussels over running excessive deficits because of its importance to the eurozone - where it is the second-largest economy behind Germany.\n\nThat attitude was famously summed up by Jean-Claude Juncker, a former commission president, when he was asked in 2016 why France was not forced to play by the same rules as, say, Greece or Portugal: \"Because it's France.\"\n\nBut Reuters reported today that some of the ECB's governors are expected to insist that the central bank should not intervene until Paris has thrashed out some kind of agreement with the Commission over its deficit.\n\nHowever, during a panel discussion, Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, indicated the ECB could intervene and especially if a sell-off in French government debts spread contagion to other Eurozone debt - just as her predecessor, Mario Draghi, did in 2012.\n\nMs Lagarde said: \"The European Central Bank has to do what it has to do. Our mandate is price stability. Price stability is obviously relying on financial stability, and we are attentive to that.\"\n\nSo markets have been put on notice.\n\nThe bigger picture, though, is that bond investors will continue to have concerns about the French deficit whatever the outcome on Sunday.",
        "summary": "The poll that financial markets will be watching most closely over the next few days is the second round parliamentary 'run-off' in France this Sunday.\nBut uncertainty remains in the air as the NPF and French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble (Together) alliance scramble to prevent a triumph for RN.\nWhoever gets the most votes in the second round wins.\nThere has also been a sell-off in French government bonds - reflecting concerns that a high-spending RN or NPF government would increase borrowing.\nThe bigger picture, though, is that bond investors will continue to have concerns about the French deficit whatever the outcome on Sunday.",

        "title": "Britain's Political Earthquake: What It Means For Growth, The Pound And Public Finances",
        "body": "melis82\n\nBy James Smith, Developed Markets Economist, UK; Michiel Tukker, Senior European Rates Strategist; Benjamin Schroeder, Senior Rates Strategist; and Francesco Pesole, FX Strategist\n\nUK exit polls predict a landslide win for Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party and humiliation for the ruling Conservatives under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. While the result has been largely \u2018baked-in\u2019 given the opinion polls, the new government faces enormous financial and fiscal challenges.\n\nA political earthquake has struck the UK after its election\n\nThe UK has voted, the exit poll is in, and the result looks clear: Labour will govern with a significant majority for the next five years. If that exit poll is accurate \u2013 and history suggests it will be \u2013 Labour is on course for a majority of around 170 seats. The incumbent Conservative party, gifted with an 80-seat majority at the last election in 2019, is projected to see its seats fall to just 131 from 365 five years ago.\n\nFinancial markets are, not surprisingly, unmoved, given that opinion polls have barely budged since the election was called six weeks ago. The pound did not react at all to the exit poll.\n\nIn stark contrast to political events across the channel in France, the UK\u2019s election has looked like a foregone conclusion for months. This lack of market volatility is a welcome change after successive episodes of political turmoil.\n\nIt\u2019s also a marked difference to the last election in 2019, where financial markets had to contend with uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future EU trading relationship, the tail-risk of a second Scottish referendum, as well as some bold pledges on fiscal policy. None of that has been true in this campaign.\n\nOf course, investors have not forgotten the 2022 \u2018mini budget\u2019 crisis and the unfunded tax pledges that caused an alarming stir in gilt markets. Since then, the risk premium for gilts has come down considerably. There\u2019s a recognition that UK politicians are likely to tread carefully around bond markets, whoever prevailed in this election.\n\nLabour's public finances challenge is sizeable\n\nYet, the challenges facing the UK public finances have not disappeared. Elevated gilt yields reflect the fact that public debt is within spitting distance of 100%, and the deficit is at 4.4%.\n\nGlobal bond investors have turned more sensitive to fiscal sustainability these past few months, and there\u2019s a sense that Labour will inevitably need to go beyond what it promised during the campaign. The party has been clear that it wants to avoid further austerity. But the party\u2019s promised revenue raisers amount to less than half a percent of GDP. And Labour has ruled out raising taxes that account for 80% of government revenue.\n\nGrowing the economy, a central Labour pledge, is unlikely to deliver the goods either, even if prospects are improving. Second quarter growth is likely to come in at a healthy 0.4-0.5% after a punchy 0.7% in the first quarter. Whether this will continue over successive years is much more questionable.\n\nIt\u2019s not us that the government needs to convince; it\u2019ll need to persuade the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that its plans mean higher productivity and a brighter economy. That\u2019s the key to unlocking more cash under the fiscal rules.\n\nThe issue is that the OBR\u2019s growth forecasts already look too optimistic. If anything, those projections could end up being downgraded, reducing the incoming Chancellor\u2019s manoeuvrability yet further.\n\nRemember the OBR said in March that on current plans, the government would meet its fiscal rules by just \u00a38bn. That\u2019s a rounding error in the context of the UK\u2019s public finances, and the rise in market interest rates since March will have further diminished that number.\n\nLabour has more options than you might think\n\nThe challenge is big, but it would be wrong to say that Labour has no options. In fact, the new government might find it easier to find extra cash in its first budget than many think.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at these options in more detail when the election results are in. But in short, small edits to the fiscal rules and several tweaks to minor taxes and associated reliefs could deliver the money needed to end planned cuts to spending.\n\nThose cuts look set to exceed 3% a year in real terms for unprotected government departments, and many economists think that\u2019s unrealistic given the existing strains on services. Ending those cuts will cost in the region of \u00a320bn a year.\n\nFinding that number is doable, but that simply maintains the level of real-terms spending. A more ambitious approach to government services, given the long-run challenges of an ageing population and an ailing healthcare system, would require more money to be found.\n\nMore significant tax rises may be unavoidable, though perhaps not this year. The incoming Labour government will also be tempted to borrow more to finance investment, and the manifesto committed to \u00a33.5bn of just that. That's a drop in the ocean, but a statement of intent nevertheless.\n\nLabour is clearly treading carefully, given how markets reacted in 2022 to additional borrowing plans to finance tax cuts. But we suspect investors would be more accepting this time around, assuming, of course, that extra borrowing is intrinsically linked to productive infrastructure investment and is done through a clear framework.\n\nElection result gives green light to August rate cut\n\nAll of that will keep the incoming Chancellor busy in the coming weeks. And expect Britain's first-ever female Chief Finance Minister, Rachel Reeves. In the meantime, the absence of seismic changes to the public finances means the Bank of England can get on with the job of cutting interest rates. Markets are pricing a 60% chance of an August rate cut, and we think that\u2019s too low.\n\nBoE officials have been barred from public comments during the campaign, and that helps explain why UK rates have largely tracked price action in the US. But watch out for comments from BoE rate-setters next week, which might seek to boost expectations for an August cut.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that some policymakers thought the decision was finely balanced at the most recent June meeting, and the BoE has played down recent upside surprises to inflation. We expect three rate cuts this year, starting in August, which is more than markets are currently pricing.\n\nIf Labour's fiscal plans don't raise alarm bells among investors, and the BoE can indeed start cutting later this year, then 10-year gilt yields could end the year well below 4.0%. The further compression of any remaining risk premium related to fiscal uncertainty would help bring yields down. So too, will concerns about the global growth outlook.\n\nFX: Pound untouched, BoE easing still points to sterling drifting down\n\nThe pound did not move at all as exit polls were published at 10pm BST, a testament to how fully priced-in a Labour landslide win was. Even if Keir Starmer\u2019s party were projected to secure fewer seats than the pre-election polls had suggested, the parliament majority is so wide that markets are understandably disregarding the slightly softer result.\n\nBank of England policy plans remain the most important domestic driver for the pound, and our call for an August cut (16bp priced in) is the main reason for expecting a weakening in the sterling.\n\nWhen it comes to the medium and long-term currency considerations, the budget restrictions the new government will face suggest a weakening of economic fundamentals for the pound and some depreciating pressure.\n\nFor now, both EUR/GBP and GBP/USD are fairly valued according to our Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate model; when considering also the absence of political risk premium into this election, there is no technical hindrance to a moderate GBP depreciation.\n\nOur call remains for a move to 1.25 in Cable and to 0.86 in EUR/GBP on the back of the Bank of England easing this summer. The risks to those two calls mostly stem more from a potentially weaker USD, due to softer US data, for example, or a weaker EUR (not least given the state of EU politics), and less from a round of idiosyncratic sterling strength, at least in our view.\n\nContent Disclaimer\n\nThis publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

        "title": "Betting Big On A Tiny Texan - Why I Just Bought LandBridge (NYSE:LB)",
        "body": "Gerasimov174\n\nIntroduction\n\nI just broke a few of my rules.\n\nI bought a company that does not pay a dividend.\n\nThat company has extremely limited historical data.\n\nThis company is majority-owned by a small investor group.\n\nYet, I still invested almost all of my cash reserves, making it a 4.1% holding of my dividend growth portfolio, which now includes almost my entire net worth.\n\nI only do this when dealing with high-conviction investments.\n\nThe company we're talking about is LandBridge Company LLC (NYSE:LB), a corporation that is so young that most financial websites do not even provide details yet.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nIn this article, I'll explain why I have very high hopes for this company, as it fits perfectly what I'm looking for in an investment.\n\nHowever, I will start by discussing a different company, as this is important to understand the bigger picture and my investment method.\n\nSo, as we have a lot to discuss, let's get right to it!\n\nWhy I Bought Texas Pacific Land\n\nI have to admit that I have been investing a lot more capital than I initially planned this year. I started new positions in a number of companies, including the Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL), which is now my largest holding, accounting for 13% of my portfolio.\n\nOn May 11, I wrote an article titled \"Texas Pacific Land: I'm So Bullish It Hurts.\"\n\nSee, Texas Pacific Land is a landowner in Texas, where it owns roughly 870 thousand surface acres. These assets are located in the Permian, the biggest oil basin in the United States. It's also one of the few basins capable of consistent growth.\n\nTexas Pacific Land Corporation\n\nWhat makes TPL so special is its ability to benefit from oil and gas production without having to invest substantial amounts of capital. It lets oil corporations drill on its land in exchange for royalties.\n\nThis makes it one of the most profitable companies on the market, with a net income margin of 64% last year - way above the S&P 500's 11-12% net profit margin.\n\nMoreover, because it owns the surface and water rights as well, it also makes money from water sales, pipelines, and everything that happens on its land.\n\nHence, I bought the company for a number of reasons:\n\nI wanted to own inflation protection, as I believe in above-average inflation on a prolonged basis.\n\nEnergy and real estate are two of the best protectors against inflation. TPL combines the best of two worlds, as it benefits from oil and gas and the value of its land.\n\nWhile most of its land is desert in Texas, the value is rising as TPL is capitalizing on the rising need for water management in the Permian. On top of selling water for drilling purposes, it could soon clean water and start more value-adding operations on its land.\n\nThe company's largest investor is Murray Stahl's Horizon Kinetics. In a recent round-table, which a follower sent to me (thank you!), Mr. Stahl noted his intent to invest in LandBridge, which he briefly discussed as a TPL-like company.\n\nI immediately went to work and decided that LB was the perfect addition to my portfolio. I liked it so much that I broke some of my rules, which I mentioned at the start of this article.\n\nWithout Water, There's No Oil\n\nIf I had to answer this question of why I bought LandBridge with just one sentence, I would say something like: \"LandBridge is a mini-TPL.\"\n\nLike Texas Pacific Land, LandBridge is a landowner in the Permian.\n\nHowever, it is less dependent on oil and gas royalties and has a bigger focus on surface operations, including the water boom in the Permian.\n\nFounded in 2021 (when it started buying land), LandBridge owns roughly 222 thousand surface acres in the Delaware, which is a sub-basin of the Permian Basin.\n\nThe major benefit of these acres is that most of them are connected, which will allow the company to engage in bigger projects without having to take other stakeholders into account.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nThe company went public on June 28 at a price below its initial target.\n\nBloomberg\n\nInitially, the company went public at $17 after marketing shares in the $19 to $22 range. Currently, shares are trading at $24.00. I got in at $23.09.\n\nTo quote Bloomberg (I added emphasis):\n\nThe company owns about 220,000 surface acres in and around the Delaware sub-basin in the Permian Basin, the biggest US oil patch, the filings show. It has contracts with WaterBridge Holdings LLC, a provider of water to the fracking industry that shares management with both LandBridge and Five Point.\n\nThis part is very important. After the IPO, investors owned 14.5 million shares of the company, which is 19.8% of its value. All of these are Class A shares, which are entitled to a future dividend (more on that later).\n\nLandBridge Holdings LLC owns 80.2% of total shares through almost 59 million Class B shares. These shares are not entitled to a dividend but come with equal voting rights.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nAs we can see in the Bloomberg quote, LandBridge shares a management team and a financial sponsor (Five Point Energy) with WaterBridge.\n\nWaterBridge is also a company of Five Point Energy, which focuses on value-adding companies in the energy space. WaterBridge is the largest midstream company in the United States focused on water infrastructure. It handles close to 2 million barrels of water per day from oil and natural gas production.\n\nEssentially, LandBridge was formed by Five Point and its management team to acquire and manage land in the Delaware Basin, supporting WaterBridge's water infrastructure.\n\nPersonally, I believe water is one of the most overlooked investment opportunities in the energy space.\n\nWhat we are dealing with here is water as a by-product of oil and gas production, and water needed to produce oil and gas. So-called produced water comes out of wells during the production of oil and gas.\n\nThe Delaware Basin is known to have a very high water/oil ratio. In general, up to four gallons of water are produced per gallon of oil, meaning through the 2030s, data suggest we're looking at more than 14 million gallons of produced water per day.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nSome assets of LandBridge have a water-to-oil ratio of almost 10x, as we can see in the overview below.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nLast year, WaterBridge signed a contract with Devon Energy (DVN), one of America's largest onshore producers of oil and gas, to deal with its water.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, Devon and NDB Midstream entered into a long-term agreement pursuant to which Devon has committed all of its produced water within a large area of mutual interest, including an initial dedication of ~52,000 acres, and contributed to NDB Midstream 18 SWDs with ~375,000 bpd of permitted capacity and ~210 miles of produced water pipelines for gathering, transportation, disposal and reuse. As part of the transaction, Devon received a 30% equity interest in NDB Midstream as well as a commitment by Five Point to fund a portion of the initial build of the system expansion. - WaterBridge (emphasis added)\n\nWaterBridge also has a deal with Texas Pacific Land.\n\nThe agreement enables TPL and WaterBridge to provide full-cycle water solutions to customers throughout an expansive, defined region around the Stateline area by facilitating infrastructure and water services development and asset optimization. The combined land positions of TPL and WaterBridge provide unrivaled access to a vast development area for each company. TPL will deliver its source water capabilities across an underutilized developmental area, and WaterBridge will expand its produced water management and infrastructure operations. In addition, TPL and WaterBridge are developing next-generation, sustainability-focused disposal and reuse solutions. - Texas Pacific Land Corporation\n\nThe deeper oil companies drill, and the more oil the Permian produces, the higher the need for water infrastructure - especially because volumes are now so high that traditional water trucking is often not sufficient anymore.\n\nGoing back to the WaterBridge and LandBridge relationship, Landbridge's land position provides the necessary surface acreage and subsurface reservoirs for large-scale-produced water handling solutions.\n\nWaterBridge needs this land to grow, which puts LandBridge in a fantastic spot to benefit from it, which brings me to the next part.\n\nHow LandBridge Makes Money\n\nZooming out again, LandBridge makes money from three segments.\n\nSurface Use Royalties and Revenues : This segment includes surface use royalty agreements (\"SURAs\") and certain surface use agreements (SUAs). SURAs involve handling produced water, skim oil recovery, and other infrastructure uses, which provide steady income over initial terms that typically range from five to ten years. Meanwhile, SUAs include easements and rights-of-way for infrastructure like pipelines and roads, with Landbridge earning fixed payments and additional fees during renewal periods. In other words, if anything happens on LandBridge land, it makes money from it.\n\nResource Sales and Royalties : Landbridge sells brackish water for well completions, which allows it to earn fees per barrel. The company also leases land for sand mining operations, receiving royalties per ton of sand that is extracted and fees for water used in mining operations. Additionally, Landbridge sells caliche for construction purposes, allowing it to earn a fixed fee per cubic yard.\n\nOil and Gas Royalties: The company makes money from oil and gas production on its land. It does not produce oil and gas itself but gets royalties from third-party oil and gas production.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nOn a pro-forma basis, the company generated roughly 22% of its revenues from oil and gas royalties, making it less dependent on the price of these commodities than its bigger peer, Texas Pacific Land.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nIn general, the company's business strategy is to maximize shareholder value by growing free cash flow in a sustainable way by expanding its revenue streams with minimal capital investments.\n\nThis includes diversified revenues beyond water, oil, gas, and sand, as the company is exploring opportunities in energy transition infrastructure such as solar and hydrogen projects in addition to next-gen technologies like data centers for the AI \"revolution.\"\n\nCurrently, two solar facilities are being built on LandBridge land. According to the company, it is also being approached by hydrogen project developers looking to build on its land.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nLandBridge has a few things going in its favor:\n\nIt has land in a very remote area.\n\nThis region comes with very cheap energy. Earlier this year, natural gas was so cheap that it had negative prices in some areas due to elevated production volumes and infrastructure shortages.\n\nIts land is mostly connected, which is great for large-scale projects as it reduces the involvement of other parties.\n\nThis is absolutely fantastic for energy-intensive operations, including hydrogen production, storage, and data centers.\n\nData center demand is exploding due to the AI revolution, which requires a lot of energy.\n\nAs \"nobody\" wants to live close to a data center and because building these data centers comes with energy challenges, it makes sense to build them in remote places where energy is cheap.\n\nFurthermore, because the Permian has so much water, it can be used to cool these data centers!\n\nIt just keeps getting better.\n\nAs reported by HartEnergy on June 28, LandBridge is working on a 100-year lease agreement with a developer that could result in the construction of a 1 GW data center over the next two years.\n\nHartEnergy\n\nSo, what does this mean for shareholders?\n\nDividends & Valuation\n\nLandBridge is a very young company. It just went public, and most deals are still in very early stages.\n\nHence, as one can imagine, the company does not yet pay a dividend.\n\nHowever, there will likely be a dividend in the future. I added emphasis to the quote below:\n\nWe intend to pay dividends on our Class A shares in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors. [...] Assuming OpCo makes distributions to us and the OpCo Unitholders, including LandBridge Holdings, in any given year, we intend to pay dividends in respect of our Class A shares out of some or all of such dividends, if any, remaining after the payment of taxes and other expenses. However, because our board of directors may determine to pay or not pay dividends in respect of our Class A shares based on the factors described above, holders of our Class A shares may not necessarily receive dividends, even if OpCo makes such distributions to us. - LandBridge Company LLC\n\nEssentially, the company is saying it intends to pay a dividend if it receives dividends from OpCo, which is a different name for DBR Land Holdings. That's the umbrella under which its operating subsidiaries work, as the overview in this article sowed.\n\nThis means if the company makes money, it can pay a dividend. However, it also noted that dividends are subject to other issues as well. This makes sense, as it cannot legally make any promises regarding its dividend - no company can do that. Even a company like Coca-Cola (KO) writes in its 10-K that its dividend is dependent on the Board of Directors and many financial decisions.\n\nPersonally, I believe the company will start paying a dividend in the first three years of its post-IPO existence. That's an educated guess. CapEx requirements will be very low, as it mainly holds the land, and its margins are sky-high.\n\nFor example, in 2023, the company's \"predecessor\" (that's OpCo) generated $73 million in revenues. It turned these revenues into $63 million worth of net income. That's an 86% net income margin.\n\nIt also generated $50 million in free cash flow, that's 80% of net income.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nThe pro-forma numbers include a 2024 acquisition of the East Stateline Ranch of roughly 103 thousand surface acres, which was a major part of re-shaping the modern LandBridge company.\n\nWith regard to growth, the predecessor company generated $52 million in 2022 revenues. This implies 43% growth between 2022 and 2023.\n\nHaving said all of this, LandBridge is currently worth $1.76 billion. This is based on 73.2 million shares (58.7 million Class B + 14.5 million Class A shares) and a $24.00 stock price.\n\nThis translates to 28x its 2023 income. I consider this to be a great deal.\n\nTexas Pacific Land, which is the only comparable company, trades at 40x earnings.\n\nTo be honest, LandBridge does not deserve to trade at 40x earnings. While \"elevated\" P/E ratios make sense for companies with ultra-high margins, TPL has a proven business model. LandBridge does not.\n\nMoreover:\n\nTPL has no financial debt.\n\nLandBridge has roughly $255 million in pro-forma debt as of March 31, 2024. That's 3.1x pro-forma 2023 EBITDA. It targets a 2.5x net leverage ratio. This is a healthy balance sheet.\n\nLandBridge Company LLC\n\nThat said, I believe the current valuation is a great deal, as we are excluding any future growth.\n\nAlthough I cannot estimate how high growth will be due to the uncertainty of ongoing negotiations in hydrogen, data centers, and solar (among others), I think two things for sure:\n\nThe Permian is in a great place to boost long-term oil and gas output. This tremendously benefits water volumes. WaterBridge, for example, handles 2 million barrels of water per day. The capacity on LandBridge land is roughly 3.5 million barrels. This is more growth without elevated CapEx requirements.\n\nEven if it takes time, the Permian will see more interest from providers of solar, data centers, hydrogen, and other projects.\n\nThe problem I have is that I just cannot yet put a number on it. The same goes for analysts, as no official expectations are public yet.\n\nThat said, I'm very bullish, as I consider 28x 2023 earnings to be a steal, as it's based on 2023 numbers and excludes any future growth.\n\nAs I am very bullish on water demand, oil production/prices, and its negotiations with solar/hydrogen/data center operators, I will give the company a Strong Buy rating and keep buying on potential dips, as LandBridge has become a high-conviction investment of mine.\n\nNonetheless, please be aware of the risks we're dealing with here. As much as I like LandBridge, due to its age and recent IPO, uncertainty is elevated. Be careful and do your own due diligence.\n\nRegardless of how much I love this company, this article was not written to push anyone into a company that just went public.\n\nOther than that, my honest opinion is that we may be dealing with an extremely promising long-term investment here. A mini-TPL with assets that could allow us to benefit from a wide range of long-term secular tailwinds.\n\nTakeaway\n\nI broke my rules and invested heavily in LandBridge despite the absence of a dividend, a lack of historical data, and being majority-owned by a small group.\n\nWhy?\n\nThat's because LB is a \"mini-TPL\" with substantial land in the Permian Basin, which is crucial for water infrastructure and comes with oil and gas royalty benefits.\n\nMoreover, partnered with WaterBridge, LB is primed to capitalize on the high water volumes in oil production and expand into energy transition projects like solar and hydrogen. It is also in a prime position to benefit from the data center boom.\n\nDespite its recent IPO and associated risks, I believe LB's growth potential and diversified revenue streams make it an exciting, high-conviction addition to my portfolio.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros:\n\nPrime Location : LB owns substantial land in the Permian Basin, which comes with a wide range of royalty and royalty-like income flows.\n\n: LB owns substantial land in the Permian Basin, which comes with a wide range of royalty and royalty-like income flows.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs BDC: Improvements, But Key Risks Remain (NYSE:GSBD)",
        "body": "Trevor Williams\n\nI have been actively covering Goldman Sachs BDC (NYSE:NYSE:GSBD) since December last year, when I issued my initial thesis that was somewhat conservative. The issue was related to the weakening portfolio dynamics coupled with relatively marginal dividend coverage level that together outweighed the GSBD positives such as focus on well-established businesses and primarily senior secured first lien structures.\n\nAfter some while GSBD circulated its Q4, 2023 earnings deck, which I also assessed per a separate article. Here the new data points were not sufficient to justify a more bullish stance on GSBD as the portfolio quality continued to worsen. Furthermore, it become even more evident after the Q4 earnings release that GSBD really struggles to capitalize on its potential synergistic effects with the broader Goldman investment banking arm (i.e., the management has not managed to register surplus investment volumes over the TTM period, which is critical for BDCs to grow the NII generation).\n\nIf we take a look at the total return performance of GSBD since the moment when my first piece was published, we will notice a somewhat correlated return profile with the broader BDC market.\n\nYcharts\n\nNow, a while ago, GSBD published its Q1, 2024 earnings deck, which includes some additional insights that are worth contextualizing against the current thesis to understand whether the overall investment case of GSBD has improved.\n\nThesis\n\nAll in all, the Q1, 2024 performance of GSBD could be deemed decent and in line with how the market has priced the stock since the date of the earnings release (which is an increase of 2% in total return terms). At the same time, the results were not overly positive that would justify higher share price or a change in investment stance (to a more bullish one) on GSBD. Let me explain.\n\nThe net investment income per share for the first quarter was $0.55, which implies a decrease of $0.01 per share compared to the prior quarter, which itself came in materially lower than what GSBD had achieved in Q3, 2023.\n\nThe key reasons behind the continued drop in the net investment income generation was related to the top-line dynamics. During the quarter, the total investment income decreased mostly due to the accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts. On top of this, the GSBD also recorded an increase in PIK income, which is not cash like item and effectively reduces the quality of earnings.\n\nDespite the weaker results in the NII generation, GSBD has still maintained its dividend level at $0.45 per share, which after the Q1 period marks the company's 37th consecutive quarter of a $0.45 per share dividend. Yet, if we compare this dividend with GSBD's NII per share results we will arrive at a dividend coverage of ~ 120%, which indicates a reasonable margin of safety.\n\nBased on this surplus, GSBD should be able to also build up its NAV base and fund new acquisitions without relying solely on the external debt. However, during Q1, GSBD registered a minor drop in its net asset value per share of 0.5%. While the net investment income again exceeded the quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share, this surplus was neutralized by several investment write-downs (although the total non-accrual base dropped to 1.6% of the total portfolio FV).\n\nNow, if we take a look at GSBD funding volumes, which was one of my identified red-flags in the previous articles, we will observe some improvement. During Q1, 2024, GSBD originated circa $360 million in new investment commitments, which was the highest figure the BDC had achieved over the trailing twelve month period. The sales and repayment activity also came in higher than in at a relatively sizeable level of $115.7 million, but against the backdrop of growing funding volumes, the total portfolio value finally ticked higher.\n\nGSBD Investor Presentation\n\nHere it is also worth highlighting the commentary in the recent earnings call by Alex Chi \u2013 Co-Chief Executive Officer - who provided a nice color on the improving funding volume outlook:\n\nYes. Just the pipeline of new opportunities has really picked up materially, and I think it just points to the themes that we've been talking about, which is the significant amount of dry powder that private equity firms have that they will need to deploy, but also the record amount of portfolio companies that need to get sold due to the DPI pressure that firms have, especially if they want to raise their next vintage of funds.\n\nWith all of this being said, my key concern still remains in place (unchanged). Although GSBD is nicely diversified across 149 portfolio companies that operate across 39 different industries, the underlying financial profiles of these businesses are just too risky. Namely, the weighted average net debt to EBITDA of these companies remained flat at 6.1x, which is a clear indicative of an elevated financial risk. Also, from the debt service cost perspective, the picture does not look that sound. The weighted average interest coverage of GSBD's investment portfolio companies did not improve either, remaining flat at 1.5x.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe recent quarterly earnings report did indeed deliver some encouraging data points about GSBD's prospects to stabilize its NII generation levels. The most important aspect is that the net funding volumes were positive allowing GSBD to organically grow its portfolio, which, in turn, should create a more favorable environment from which to increase its NII results. Furthemore, it seems now that the pipeline is also strong as implied from the management's commentary and sizeable gross originations.\n\nHaving said that, the underlying portfolio quality still remains a notable concerns with the key credit metrics (e.g., net debt to EBITDA and DSCR) remaining unchanged at a levels that are clearly indicating an elevated financial risk. Yet, at the same time, GSBD trades at a premium to its NAV of ~ 8%, which, in my opinion, does not take into account the risk of incremental non-accruals that could stem from weakening economy affecting the highly leveraged portfolio companies.\n\nAs a result of these dynamics, I do not view Goldman Sachs BDC as a solid investment choice in the BDC space.",

        "title": "Zscaler Stock Is Undervalued And Positioned For High Growth (NASDAQ:ZS)",
        "body": "sankai/E+ via Getty Images\n\nIn my opinion, there is a very large upside to be had in Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) stock over the next year due to present lower valuation multiples compared to historically. I believe that the company's P/S ratio is likely to contract further, but high future estimated revenue per share growth from Wall Street analysts indicates outsized returns anyway. The company is one of the leaders in the SaaS cybersecurity field, and in my opinion, it offers the best valuation among other leading players at this time. The advanced cybersecurity market is currently in high growth amid trends in digitalization and AI, which is why I am bullish on Zscaler, given its lower valuation compared to major competitors like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CrowdStrike (CRWD).\n\nOperational Analysis\n\nZscaler's core products and services include Zscaler Internet Access, which provides secure access to external applications and internet destinations, and Zscaler Private Access, which offers secure access to internal applications. In addition, its Zero Trust Exchange is a cloud-native platform that connects users, devices, and applications using zero trust principles.\n\nZscaler's security services are cloud-based without the need for on-premises controls. It also provides URL filtering, anti-virus, sandboxing, and other security controls. The company uses a distributed cloud architecture and has data centers established globally. It was recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Security Service Edge and serves over 30% of Forbes Global 2000 companies. The company processes approximately 400 billion transactions daily.\n\nSignificant long-term growth catalysts for the company include cloud adoption and digital transformation. McKinsey has stated the significance of cloud platforms in facilitating digital transformation, claiming that cloud platforms can \"bring new capabilities to market about 20 to 40 percent faster\". In addition, new SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules, as discussed in the University of Maryland article, are likely to increase investment in cybersecurity.\n\nZscaler's Zero Trust Exchange platform is key to its offering. The technology provides secure access, a reduced attack surface and comprehensive inspection, all with AI and machine learning integration on a cloud-native platform. Put simply, the Zero Trust Exchange platform eliminates the need for complex network segmentation and multiple-point products. Management has unified its services into a single, integrated cyber threat protection, data protection, zero trust connectivity, and digital experience management platform.\n\nThere is also future potential for management to adopt AI in its cybersecurity offerings and have AI-as-a-service solutions that automate threat detection, monitoring, response and mitigation tasks. While this is already being implemented to some degree, it is less extensive than it would need to be to operate fully autonomously, particularly as it relates to threat response. As the demand and needs of organizations become larger and more sophisticated as the cyber-threat landscape evolves, Zscaler's TAM is likely to expand, in my opinion.\n\nFinancial & Valuation Analysis\n\nZscaler has been delivering extremely strong revenue growth, but it is yet to deliver a profit, other than on a normalized basis, where it reported a profit for the fiscal period ending July 2023. However, its free cash flow growth has been good, primarily because the company has been giving stock-based compensation of very large amounts each year.\n\nData by YCharts ZS Stock-Based Compensation (Seeking Alpha)\n\nThe fact that much of the net income loss is due to SBC is promising, in my opinion. It shows that the company's fundamental growth is extremely strong, and while the SBC is diluting shareholder value, long-term investors likely do not mind, as the net benefit of high SBC on attracting talent and driving results is arguably worth the current depletion in profitability and value per share.\n\nHowever, one area where I am less pleased is the company's balance sheet because its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.26, and its debt-to-equity ratio, including lease obligations, is 1.13. Most of its current liabilities are unearned revenue, and most of its long-term liabilities are long-term debt. This is more of an issue to me than the high levels of SBC because I believe that this high level of liabilities has the potential to inhibit its growth and acquisition strategy moving forward.\n\nCrowdStrike, which is one of Zscaler's key competitors, has an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.37 and a debt-to-equity ratio, including lease obligations, of just 0.31. Palo Alto Networks has an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.25 and a debt-to-equity ratio, including lease obligations, of 0.34. Therefore, while high levels of liabilities are common in this relatively new industry, it is Zscaler's level of debt to equity, which I believe significantly inhibits it at present compared to competitors. Such a high level of debt and the associated interest payments will certainly leave it with less liquidity to expand, develop and iterate effectively.\n\nGiven the lack of profitability thus far, it is difficult to ascertain a fair value for Zscaler. Instead, I think it is more appropriate to adopt a price target based on multiple estimates over the next 10 years. To start with, this is how the valuation multiples have adjusted since its IPO:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAt this time, Zscaler has a forward P/S ratio of 14, compared to 24.67 as a 5Y average. It is difficult to ascertain what P/S ratio the market will tolerate for Zscaler moving forward. However, based on consensus Wall Street estimates, a revenue CAGR over the next 10 years of around 22.5% seems reasonable to me to predict what Zscaler will achieve. Given that, and the fact that this CAGR is significantly lower than the 52% revenue CAGR the company has delivered as a 5Y average, I think the P/S ratio will contract. In my opinion, a contraction to a P/S ratio of around 9 over 10 years is probable. Given that the current revenue per share is $13.69, my price target for 2034 is $937.58, implying a 16.86% price return CAGR given the present stock price of $197.39.\n\nThat being said, I think that investors must prepare for periods of high volatility, including periods where the stock price may become over-inflated due to moments of higher adoption of digital cybersecurity services alongside trends in AI. As such, I do not think it is unreasonable for investors to sell their position if the stock rises toward a point where the implied 10Y CAGR becomes closer to 10%. Doing so would mitigate risk from downside volatility that could occur if management does not meet quarterly expectations or competitive threats become more severe.\n\nIn addition to this, I think it is important that shareholders monitor the company's profitability, as a failure to stabilize this over the next few years and maintain growth will likely dampen investor sentiment. Because we have not yet had reliable proof that management can sustain profitability on the net income level without high levels of SBC, I think some caution is warranted. In my opinion, a reduction in SBC is likely to improve overall profitability at this stage. So, I think it would be wise for management to begin looking at curbing the SBC program to begin favoring long-term net income.\n\nRisk Analysis\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabz 2024 AI Security Report brought to light the increasing sophistication of AI-driven cybersecurity threats. Unauthorized AI applications, or \"shadow AI\", can introduce vulnerabilities and data leakage risks. While it is promising that Zscaler has highlighted this threat and is actively working to mitigate the risk, potential vulnerabilities may arise if it cannot stay competitive. This risk is further enhanced by the fact that its balance sheet is weaker than I would like, potentially inhibiting the aggressive M&A it would likely benefit from to stay competitive in combating advanced AI-led cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe rapid pace of technological change is also likely to have a constraining effect on the company managing to maintain profitability growth rate expansion. In addition to advances in threat capabilities, there are also likely to be iterations and developments from competitors, including CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, who have both expanded into zero-trust architecture. Both competitors have a much higher enterprise value compared to Zscaler, giving them a much higher capacity to consolidate their moats as well as acquire emerging companies. I believe the threat to Zscaler purely based on size shouldn't be underestimated at a time when AI cyber-threat capabilities are likely to intensify, and the larger, more prepared companies are better equipped to deal with this. Small-cap and mid-cap cybersecurity firms are definitely likely to face challenges, in my opinion, and large-cap companies like Zscaler will have to reinvest aggressively to remain proficient.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nConclusion\n\nI think the likelihood of Zscaler achieving 15%+ price returns over the next 10 years is likely, even given the risks that could affect its profitability growth. I think the P/S ratio is likely to contract significantly, but the high levels of revenue growth anticipated offset this. In addition, the company's SBC policy is probably due to begin to be eased to help aid its net income growth, as this is the biggest cause of the current lack of net income. That being said, a gradual and strategic approach to this would be wise for management to retain the necessary incentives to drive growth. The company has already developed significant free cash flow growth to prove that it is running a sustainable business model. Therefore, I am rating Zscaler a Strong Buy, with caution warranted from high volatility, which I presume is likely, and balance sheet risks creating some inhibition in management's ability to compete in M&A over the long term.",

        "title": "Meta Platforms Stock: Explaining The Growth Algorithm And Prospects (NASDAQ:META)",
        "body": "gorodenkoff/iStock via Getty Images\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) has seen its shares nearly 5x from their 2022 trough, driven by a relentless focus on efficiency, huge success in Reels, and achieving best-in-class ad targeting capabilities in a post-ATT world.\n\nToday, as Reels monetization reaches neutrality, comps begin to get tougher, and Zuckerberg directs a lot of attention and resources toward AI, investors are once again questioning the company's future.\n\nThis is a good time to explain Meta's complex growth algorithm and show why it has a very bright future ahead.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI've been covering Meta on Seeking Alpha since July of last year. Across four articles, I discussed Meta's year of efficiency success, the burden of the Reality Labs segment, the significant remaining upside heading into 2024, and the potential implications of a TikTok ban.\n\nI maintained a Buy rating throughout the period, which turned out to be correct:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nWith Meta hugely outperforming the rest of its big tech peers and the indices, it's reasonable to question the remaining upside.\n\nTo answer, we need to start by discussing Meta's moat.\n\nMeta's Moat Post-ATT\n\nIn April 2021, Apple (AAPL) released an iOS update that included the App-Tracking-Transparency or 'ATT' framework. Until then, platforms like Facebook were able to track users' actions across apps, which enabled deterministic measurement of the return on ad spend. Simply put, Meta and its advertisers knew the exact conversion rates of ads shown on Meta's platforms.\n\nThen came Apple, and under the excuse of privacy, it effectively killed thousands of applications whose business model relied on advertising, a form of monetization that was harder for Apple to collect fees from.\n\nMeta was then forced to find a new way to measure the ROAS for its customers and turned to a probabilistic model. This required billions of dollars of investment, specifically on GPUs, as Meta had to build a machine-learning algorithm to gauge the conversion rates of its ads.\n\nAside from Alphabet's (GOOG) Google, there aren't too many companies in the world with enough resources to build a similar algorithm.\n\nAs a result, both Meta's and Google's moats significantly strengthened. Not only do they have the most eyeballs and time spent on their platforms, but they are now years ahead of any alternative in terms of measurement, and targeting.\n\nThis didn't only kill other ad-based applications, it also made thousands of small businesses go out of business, as it's harder to use probabilistic measures in their case.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nIt took some time, but both Meta and Google are close to beating Apple since that ATT release (and they were way ahead until the recent WWDC surge), while smaller peers like Snapchat (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) couldn't deal with the ATT implications and are still very much below their April 2021 levels.\n\nThis gives us the relevant backdrop for the next section.\n\nMeta's Playbook & Reels Monetization Worries\n\nLeveraging its best-in-class advertising offering, Meta is by far the industry leader in monetizing the most popular features of 2024. This includes Stories, and of course, Reels.\n\nEver since TikTok took the world by storm, investors were afraid that Meta would lose its dominance in the social media landscape. However, in a typical Meta way, Zuckerberg was quick enough to realize they needed to add short-form video, and engagement skyrocketed.\n\nThen, as Reels was very successful in increasing engagement, investors were worried about its dilutive effect on monetization.\n\nEvery time Meta adds a new feature, it starts by making it the best possible experience and then begins incorporating ads over time.\n\nAs of 2024, Reels have reached monetization neutrality, meaning Meta is essentially complacent whether a user goes through the feed, looks at Stories, or scrolls Reels.\n\nThis takes us to today.\n\nExtraordinary Success Brings Along Worries About The Future\n\nAll those struggles that Meta encountered, including building the post-ATT infrastructure, increased competition from TikTok, regaining profitability, and dealing with a tougher advertising market, are a story of the past.\n\nPretty much since the second quarter of 2023, Meta had quarter after quarter of revenue growth acceleration and margin expansion:\n\nMeta Q1'24 Presentation\n\nAs we can see, the upcoming second quarter will still enjoy easy comps, specifically on the margin front, but from that point on, Meta will start lapping much better quarters.\n\nFurthermore, Reels monetization reached optimization in early 2024, so it will still be a big tailwind throughout the year, but it won't have this outsized impact from 2025 and beyond.\n\nOnce again, investors worry about Meta's future prospects, especially following the recent earnings call, as Meta raised both its expense and capex outlook.\n\nMeta's Increased Expense Guide & AI Investments\n\nLet's start with the profitability outlook. So far, Meta raised its expense outlook primarily due to higher legal costs, and higher infrastructure costs. This does not reflect any meaningful change in the margin outlook for the company.\n\nInvestors are justifiably uncertain about Meta's path to monetize its AI efforts. However, there are several things that should be remembered.\n\nFirst, when it comes to the development of the Llama model, Meta is playing defense against closed AI models in hopes that they won't use their AI capabilities to (1) take away engagement from its platforms and (2) diminish the leadership of its ad platform offerings.\n\nYou can easily understand that if you use closed generative AI models to generate content and/or ads, you might use Meta's platforms less. Making it open source makes sure the value remains in Meta's networks.\n\nSecond, so many times in the past Meta had success with the playbook we just discussed, I see no reason to doubt Zuckerberg's ability to succeed once again.\n\nZuckerberg is clearly happy with the 'Efficient Meta', and I can't envision him going back to the old days of reckless spending.\n\nWith that, let's turn to top-line growth.\n\nThe Top-Line Growth Algorithm Going Forward\n\nFinally, we reach the key issue of this article. At this point, I think we established that margins will remain somewhat stable going forward and that Meta has a huge moat when it comes to time spent on its platforms, and monetizing it.\n\nThe main drivers of Meta's top-line growth are reflected in the following graph:\n\nCreated by the author using data from Meta's reports.\n\nAs more people become more engaged with the platforms, Meta generates more ad impressions. As the return on those ads improves, Meta charges a higher price.\n\nImportantly, another major factor that influences the price per ad is inventory. This means that if ad impressions grow it creates a downward pressure on price.\n\nThe optimal period for revenue generation is when ad impressions are growing but demand is so high that price is growing too.\n\nUntil now, ad impressions benefitted from Reels' ad load increasing sharply. As we progress through the quarters, this will become a less meaningful tailwind.\n\nSo, what do Meta's growth prospects look like in the future?\n\nFirst, user growth, which remains steady in the mid-to-high single-digit range (crazy to think about as Meta now has 3.24 billion daily users). This will lead to more ad impressions.\n\nSecond, ad load, as Meta continues to incorporate more ads into the platform even though most features are pretty loaded up already.\n\nThree, price per ad, as Meta continues to offer a best-in-class advertising platform for advertisers, with a constantly improving Advtange+ suite.\n\nFour, new products and features, such as Threads, which recently reached 175 million monthly actives, and Meta AI.\n\nFive, higher digital advertising budgets, as more and more spending transitions to digital, and overall advertising spending continues to grow.\n\nSix, WhatsApp Business, which continues to gain traction, as reflected by the 85% growth in non-advertising FoA revenues last quarter.\n\nValuation & Low Consensus Estimates\n\nConsidering all of the above, I find consensus estimates for 12% revenue growth in 2025 extremely low. In addition, EPS estimates reflect essentially flat margins, despite the fact that this year's margins include several one-offs, primarily regarding legal costs.\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta's current multiples:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAt 22 times CY25 earnings, Meta is slightly above Google as the cheapest among big tech:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThat puts Meta at a market average valuation and a convenient 1.8x PEG. In my view, considering all the growth avenues Meta has and its extremely wide moat, this valuation is too low.\n\nIn my view, a 2x PEG would be fair, getting us to a price target of $574 a share, which reflects 13% upside, and a 25x P/E on CY25 earnings.\n\nIn addition, I expect Meta will surpass EPS estimates by a very significant margin, but I'll leave that out of the calculation.\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta has multiple drivers for continued mid-teens growth while at least maintaining current profitability.\n\nConsensus estimates materially underestimate the company's ability to sustain its efficiency gains, increase engagement, and continue to improve its advertising capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, those estimates don't reflect potential success in Threads, direct AI monetization, and WhatsApp business.\n\nEven if consensus estimates are correct, Meta is still undervalued, trading at a market-average low-twenties multiple.\n\nIf expenses go out of hand it might create a near-term selloff, similar to what we say post-earnings, but I find that unlikely and irrelevant from a long-term perspective.\n\nI reiterate Meta at Buy.",

        "title": "Alibaba Stock: Stay Greedy, The Catalyst Is Coming (NYSE:BABA)",
        "body": "maybefalse\n\nMy Thesis\n\nIn a way, I was fortunate to initiate my coverage of Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) stock at the end of January 2024, during its lowest local price point, so I luckily managed to catch the local bottom for Alibaba stock at the time. Since then, the stock has only grown by 13.5%, whereas the S&P 500 index (SPX) has increased by almost 16%, highlighting the strength of the American stock market we've seen in recent weeks.\n\nSeeking Alpha, Oakoff's coverage of BABA stock\n\nIt's been three months since my last update, and today, I've decided to revisit the growth prospects of BABA. In my opinion, the market is still not fully recognizing their potential. Alibaba remains one of the most undervalued yet highly attractive opportunities available today.\n\nI believe that the main reason why Alibaba's shares have not made any significant gains recently, even though the quotes of its Western counterparts have more than doubled in just a few months, is the weakness of the Chinese economy. However, there's a promising catalyst on the horizon that could represent a turning point for Alibaba and the entire Chinese stock market. I therefore reiterate my buy recommendation today and encourage investors to consider becoming \"greedy\" right now and take this opportunity.\n\nMy Reasoning\n\nLet's first take a look at how the company performed in its last reporting quarter.\n\nFor fiscal Q4 2024 (calendar Q1), Alibaba reported an increase in revenue of around 7% YoY, generating almost $31 billion. There was a major FX change during calendar Q1: The USD/CNY exchange rate climbed to ~7.22 from ~6.85 last year, without which the company's revenue would be significantly higher in US dollar terms. Despite these headwinds, the company's sales have been by ~$250 million stronger than analysts expected - Alibaba is clearly doing a good job of protecting its market share in the face of growing competition in the industry (something many feared and still fear).\n\nAs for the bottom line, Alibaba didn't manage to surprise analysts, even on an adjusted basis. The weak net income growth can be attributed to a 3% year-over-year decline in operating profit (in RMB currency), which amounted to only $2 billion. Adjusted EBITA fell by 5% YoY to $3.31 billion, largely due to the company's investments in its e-commerce business and \"the retention incentives granted to Cainiao employees\", according to the press release. It's difficult to determine whether these costs were one-time; regardless, the negative surprise in terms of EPS led most Wall Street analysts to lower their forecasts for the upcoming quarters, which undoubtedly put pressure on Alibaba's stock prices.\n\nSeeking Alpha, BABA, Oakoff's notes added\n\nFrom the point of view of cash generation, Alibaba also faced some difficulties in Q4 FY2024 as its net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 26% to ~$3,233 million, and FCF fell by 52% to just $2,127 million. As a result, the FCF margin, as a ratio to revenue, dropped to 11%. On the other hand, the company still generates ~13.3% in FCF yield (FCF to its market cap) on a trailing twelve-month basis, which is impressive for such a large and well-diversified company, in my opinion.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nOn a positive note, BABA recorded double-digit growth in GMV in China and in the international segment compared to the previous year. From my past coverage, I recall that Alibaba has shifted its focus from merchants to customers exactly for the sake of boosting sales and GMV, so the plan seems to be working, judging by the latest data. This approach usually results in temporary margin headwinds as price competition and customer-first focus take center stage. However, I agree with the analysts at Argus Research (proprietary source, dated May 2024), who stated that this strategy should contribute to sales growth and higher margins over time.\n\nAdditionally, in fiscal Q4 FY2024, we could see accelerated growth in customers and cloud computing revenues related to its AI products. Yes, the Cloud's revenue in general increased by just 3% YoY - incomparably lower than the figures we see in Amazon's (AMZN) AWS or Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, but Alibaba's cloud business is rapidly reviving its profitability with adjusted EBITA rising in Q4 FY2024 by 45% YoY \"due to improving product mix through the focus on public cloud and operating efficiency\".\n\nI believe that Alibaba has sufficient resources and expertise to sustain and continue this trend moving forward amid the addressable market (The Asia Pacific Cloud Infrastructure Market) projected to hit $593.7 billion in market valuation by 2032 based on Astute Analytica's research paper - that's a CAGR of 25.93% during the forecast period 2024-2032.\n\nAlibaba's IR materials\n\nIt's hard to believe, but with approximately half a trillion yuan in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet (as of March 2024) and a debt of only RMB 170 billion, Alibaba's current cash ratio is already 44%. This suggests that the company is significantly undervalued by the market, potentially by 2-3x, especially when compared to other technology giants with similar operational activities but different geographical focuses (i.e. Western peers).\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAlibaba didn't provide guidance for FY2025, but I believe while the cash cushion is still there and the FCF keeps flowing in, the substantial share repurchases program BABA currently has (and the approval of a $4.0 billion dividend for fiscal year 2024) reflects the company's ability to return massive value to its shareholders.\n\nDespite the value Alibaba stock currently represents to investors (my opinion), the stock price is basically flat YTD (even slightly down), while the non-GAAP P/E multiple for the next year is estimated at ~9x - that's a 40% discount to the sector's median, according to Seeking Alpha data. Most other multiples are also saying that BABA is quite undervalued.\n\nSeeking Alpha, BABA\n\nUndervaluation alone is not a sufficient reason to buy any stock, as serious internal and business problems can cause the valuation to fall further - this is often the reason why many stocks remain undervalued (investors call them \"value traps\"). In recent years, the difficult economic climate in China, combined with regulatory and real estate risks, has kept stocks low.\n\nWe know that the Chinese economy has been heavily reliant on real estate and the current mortgage crisis, combined with slow consumer demand growth, presented significant hurdles. For a recovery, we need a major change in the Chinese economy - a catalyst that would initiate the recovery process and have a positive impact on the stock market as a leading indicator.\n\nStocks have usually bottomed about six months before the economy but have bottomed as much as ten months before the economic decline is over. [Forbes]\n\nI'm hopeful that the upcoming events, particularly the July meeting of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China (the Third Plenum of the 20th Party Congress) will serve as catalysts for positive change.\n\nAs analysts at Goldman Sachs recently noted (proprietary source, dated July 2024), the Politburo meeting will outline policy arrangements for the rest of 2024, and while no major stimulus is expected, there may be increased support for the property market. This step would be crucial in stabilizing the property sector and mitigating downside risks to maintain about 5% real GDP growth by year-end.\n\nGoldman's calculations (proprietary source)\n\nI estimate that these incentives will have a very strong positive impact on China's real estate market, which will, in turn, boost economic growth - this should restore investor confidence in individual stocks, making BABA a primary focus for portfolio managers thanks to the moat it holds and the above-mentioned undervaluation discount.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe return of institutional investors to Alibaba shares has not yet begun, as YCharts data shows. The number of shares held by investors has declined significantly, as has the presence of well-known investors in the company's capital structure. However, I believe that their comeback is inevitable given the factors mentioned above - once this process begins, it could have a massive positive impact on Alibaba.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, the stock is near its local lows, around $75-$76 per share. The relative strength index indicates a gradual recovery, painting a divergence in the weekly timeframe. The nearest strong resistance is 56-57% above current levels, which aligns with the significant discount the company's shares are currently trading at.\n\nTrendSpider Software, Oakoff's notes added\n\nBased on all of the above, I remain \"greedy\" so to speak, and intend to buy back any major dips from the current price levels. I hope that the catalyst discussed in today's article will reignite positive sentiment towards Chinese assets, particularly Alibaba Group.\n\nRisks To My Thesis\n\nA significant risk to my bullish stance on Alibaba is the possibility of persistent macroeconomic headwinds. If the current issues with the Chinese economy - low demand growth, tech firms being heavily regulated, and a prolonged real estate crisis - are, in fact, long-term in nature, they will surely affect Alibaba's recovery and growth prospects. Also, unexpected geopolitical tensions or trade disputes could also negatively impact investors' sentiments. I therefore advise everyone to do their own due diligence and check the reasoning of any bull before getting involved.\n\nAdditionally, my thesis relies on the emergence of a catalyst, which may ultimately not materialize - one must consider what has prevented the Chinese government from addressing the current issues sooner.\n\nMoreover, the undervaluation of the company could continue indefinitely, as we have seen in recent years. If China's officials decide to devalue their local currency, as has been speculated for some time, this would significantly impact Alibaba's and other domestically oriented retailers' revenues translated into USD. This could render BABA's current low valuation multiples essentially irrelevant.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nDespite the many risks associated with my thesis, I still believe that the potential reward of buying Alibaba stock today significantly outweighs the potential risks. The company is currently trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. The growth prospects for the individual segments appear impressive. Of course, Alibaba's further performance will likely depend on how quickly the bullish sentiment for Chinese assets returns and what measures the CCP takes to stabilize the economy, especially the real estate sector. While the timing of the first step is uncertain, I believe that the second step will soon be the long-awaited catalyst that breathes new life into Alibaba stock.\n\nI reiterate my previous \"Buy\" rating.\n\nGood luck with your investments!\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.",
        "summary": "maybefalseMy ThesisIn a way, I was fortunate to initiate my coverage of Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) stock at the end of January 2024, during its lowest local price point, so I luckily managed to catch the local bottom for Alibaba stock at the time.\nSince then, the stock has only grown by 13.5%, whereas the S&P 500 index (SPX) has increased by almost 16%, highlighting the strength of the American stock market we've seen in recent weeks.\nHowever, there's a promising catalyst on the horizon that could represent a turning point for Alibaba and the entire Chinese stock market.\nConcluding ThoughtsDespite the many risks associated with my thesis, I still believe that the potential reward of buying Alibaba stock today significantly outweighs the potential risks.\nWhile the timing of the first step is uncertain, I believe that the second step will soon be the long-awaited catalyst that breathes new life into Alibaba stock.",

        "title": "Flexsteel Stock Turnaround Has Been Demonstrated, But Undervaluation Remains (FLXS)",
        "body": "Morsa Images\n\nFlexsteel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLXS), the furnishings manufacturer, has continued to report financials that the company previously guided for, causing the massive stock rally. Despite the continued financial turnaround in an increasingly challenging furnishings market, the stock hasn't yet rerated enough to reflect the increased earnings prospects.\n\nI previously published an article on the company, titled \"Flexsteel Industries: A Window Of Opportunity\". The article, published on the 19th of January, went over Flexsteel's recently reported incredibly strong preliminary Q2 results and outlook that sent the stock into a rally. I initiated Flexsteel at a Buy rating as the updated outlook completely changed Flexsteel's earnings outlook without the news being fully priced in. While the stock continued to rally after my article was published, shares have now begun to fall in recent months. As a result, the stock has now returned 9% compared to S&P 500's better return of 14% in the period.\n\nMy Rating History on FLXS (Seeking Alpha)\n\nFinancials Have Performed as Guided\n\nThe Q2 results showed revenues and a normalized EPS of $100.1 million and $0.57, respectively, in line with the previously given preliminary financials - the operating margin of 4.6% showed an impressive year-over-year expansion of 3.6 percentage points, as the revenue growth of 7.5% also pushed margins higher.\n\nThe next quarter followed with a similar improvement, as was guided in January - Q3 showed revenues 8.2% higher than in the previous year at $107.2 million, slightly exceeding the prior guidance's upper limit of $106 million - Flexsteel's continued demand momentum even seems to be exceeding what the company's management expected in early 2024. The adjusted operating margin came in at 5.2%, in the upper half of the previously given 4.5-5.5% guidance range.\n\nJerald Dittmer, Flexsteel's CEO, continued to relate the very strong financials into operational efficiencies, cost savings, and most notably improved product development. A notable factor in the improvements seems to be an improved inventory position, as excess inventories have mainly now been sold off with $96.6 million in inventories remaining from a high of $228.5 million at the end of FY2021.\n\nFor Q4 and FY2025, the guidances have been kept the same - Flexsteel continues anticipating $107-112 million in sales in Q4 with an operating margin of 5.0-6.0%, a mid-point year-over-year improvement of 3.5% and 1.5 percentage points respectively. For FY2025, revenues of $416-432 million are guided, corresponding to a mid-point growth of 3.0%. With the higher revenues a 5.5-6.5% operating margin is expected, showing continued expected margin expansion even after FY2024. With the current performance, I believe that the guidance could even turn out to be too conservative especially considering the Q3 guidance beat.\n\nTo summarize the financial performance, Flexsteel has performed as well as the January press release let investors believe, even exceeding expectations in Q3. The company continues foreseeing such improvements ahead, too, and the current financial strength makes me believe in such strong demand.\n\nFlexsteel's Georgia Plant is Being Closed to Improve Operations\n\nFlexsteel announced the plan to close the Dublin, Georgia manufacturing plant with the Q2 report. The move is expected to improve lead times, reduce handling damage, and improve other overall operations of the company's manufacturing and logistics. The manufacturing plant is responsible for less than 5% of Flexsteel's sales.\n\nDue to the closing, Flexsteel experienced $2.6 million in restructuring costs in Q3, and expects to incur $0.4-0.5 million more in restructuring costs in Q4, mainly related to employee separations. The annualized savings from the closing are expected at an impressive $4.0-4.5 million, being very notable for the total bottom line while seemingly already integrated into the previously given FY2025 guidance, though.\n\nThe plant has been planned to close in Q4 of Flexsteel's fiscal 2024, meaning by the end of June, and is planned to be listed for sale after the closing - investors could quite soon hear from the sale of the manufacturing plant, bringing additional cash to pay down remaining debt.\n\nThe Furnishings Industry's Pressures Haven't Affected Flexsteel\n\nThe furnishings industry as a whole has performed incredibly weakly in past quarters, as for example Bassett Furniture (BSET) reported a -19.6% revenue decline in its latest quarter, Hooker Furnishings (HOFT) a decline of -23.2%, and Lovesac (LOVE) a decline of -6.1% despite usually rapid growth. Flexsteel has also noted the increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment but continues to post incredibly solid financials regardless.\n\nThe weakness could eventually catch up to Flexsteel if the industry doesn't improve soon, as the incredibly weak housing market that furnishings sales depend on are still waiting for interest rates to decline. Yet, an improvement could also pose an even higher demand recovery for Flexsteel, too.\n\nDerek Schmidt Has Been Appointed as CEO\n\nJerald Dittmer announced his departure from the CEO position in December 2023. In April, Derek Schmidt was appointed as the new CEO, starting at the position at the start of July. Schmidt came from inside the company, as Schmidt has previously worked as the company's CFO with an increasingly large control over Flexsteel's operations. I believe that the appointment is great, as the newly appointed CEO has been driving Flexsteel's so far incredibly successful turnaround strategy.\n\nFLXS's Valuation Remains Attractive\n\nWith the demonstrated financials, I feel slightly more confident in estimating sustained long-term earnings - in my updated discounted cash flow [DCF] model, I now estimate a 5.5% growth in FY2024 at the upper end of the guidance, and a growth of 4.0% in FY2025 relating to the upper part of the given guidance range. Afterwards, I now estimate growth to slow down into 2.0%, slightly higher than my 1.5% estimate previously as I am now more confident in estimating sustained long-term sales volumes.\n\nWith the proven financials, I now estimate slightly higher sustained margins at a sustained 5.8% EBIT margin compared to 5.5% previously. I now estimate great cash flows in FY2025 due to the guidance, and including the sale of the Georgia manufacturing plant.\n\nThe DCF model still significantly undermines Flexsteel's long-term aspirations of $750 million in sales, a 8% operating margin, and annual free cash flow of $40 million that were again communicated in the April investor presentation - for example, my model only estimates cash flows of $21.6 million in FY2033, around half of the targeted level.\n\nDCF Model (Author's Calculation)\n\nThe estimates put Flexsteel's fair value estimate at $46.06, 48% above the stock price at the time of writing - while the market has now had time to digest the Q2 preliminary update, higher sustained earnings aren't still priced in despite the shown performance in an incredibly weak furnishings market. I believe that the investment case continues to carry a good risk-to-reward, especially as the model estimates upside even with conservative estimates compared to Flexsteel's ambitions.\n\nA weighted average cost of capital of 9.98% is used in the DCF model. The used WACC is derived from a capital asset pricing model:\n\nCAPM (Author's Calculation)\n\nAs Flexsteel continues to pay down debt, I estimate the company to eventually have no interest-bearing debt. To estimate the cost of equity, I use the 10-year bond yield of 4.37% as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.60% is Professor Aswath Damodaran's estimate for the US, updated on the 5th of January. I have kept the beta estimate at 1.11. With a liquidity premium of 0.5%, the cost of equity and WACC both stand at 9.98%.\n\nTakeaway\n\nFlexsteel has reported greatly improving earnings that the company guided for with the preliminary Q2 press release, even exceeding the Q3 revenue range. The Georgia plant's closing looks to aid profitability further in FY2025 - while the macroeconomic outlook is very aggressively pressuring the furnishings industry, Flexsteel sees no issues as cost cuts and the improved products offerings' demand continue creating a foundation for a sustained turnaround. The stock still hasn't appreciated the turnaround's earnings potential even when estimating earnings conservatively. As such, I remain with a Buy rating.",

        "title": "Novo Nordisk: Buy On Dips (NYSE:NVO)",
        "body": "Carolina Rudah\n\nThere\u2019s exactly one reason that drew me to write on the Danish pharmaceuticals company Novo Nordisk (NVO) (OTCPK:NONOF) today. And that\u2019s Ozempic. As it happens, there has been such a steady stream of its mention in my news and podcast feeds, my curiosity was piqued. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that its popularity might have come second only to updates on the all important general elections being held in various parts of the world this year.\n\nThe point is, that a medical treatment becoming a regular feature in pop culture conversation says something. Something about the size of the problem (no pun intended) it addresses. In my article on Eli Lilly (LLY) (see section on \u2018Winning in the Diabetes market\u2019 of the link), I had mentioned the extent of challenge that weight and associated lifestyle diseases represent. And these closely correlate with Ozempic\u2019s effect as well.\n\nBut being newsworthy is not the same as being a good investment. So here I take a closer look at Novo Nordisk to assess whether there's an upside to the stock or not.\n\nAdvantage Ozempic and Wegovy\n\nTechnically, Ozempic is a diabetes medication, which regulates blood sugar. But \u201cweight loss is a common side effect\u201d as University of California, Davis [UC Davis] points out. UC Davis also notes that \u201cIt is not approved for weight loss, but some physicians prescribe it to be used for weight loss\u201d. Novo Nordisk\u2019s weight management drug is actually Wegovy, which has the same active ingredient, semaglutide.\n\nOzempic leads sales\n\nBut Ozempic stands out as the company's leading treatment (see chart below), bringing in 41% of its revenues in 2023, with Wegovy bringing in another 13.5%. The weight management and diabetes segment all together is its mainstay contributing to 93% of the sales last year.\n\nSource: Statista\n\nDiabetes and obesity care show above average growth\n\nClearly, the focus segment is doing very well for Novo Nordisk, which saw a 22% sales growth at market exchange rates [MER] and 24% at constant exchange rates [CER] in DKK terms in the first quarter (Q1 2024). The Diabetes and Obesity care segment saw slightly higher growth of 25% at MER and 27% at CER, pulling up overall growth. The latest numbers follow the already robust 36% CER increase in 2023, with 42% growth for Diabetes and Obesity care.\n\nFurther expansion seen\n\nMoreover, the growth is expected only to continue as Wegovy was recently approved by China. This is a particular positive considering that China is the biggest pharmaceuticals market in the world after the US.\n\nSo far, Novo Nordisk has only limited exposure to it, with it having a less than 7% share in its sales as of 2023. Wegovy might be just the recipe for greater inroads into the market, going by the fact that more than half the 1.4 billion people in China are either overweight or obese. The treatment has also been approved in the US for people at with or at risk of cardiovascular disease due to weight management challenges.\n\nPositive full year outlook\n\nIn line with the continued boom in its focus market, it\u2019s little wonder that Novo Nordisk\u2019s full year outlook is not just positive, but was also upgraded (see graphic below). At the midpoint of the new guidance range, sales are expected to increase by 23%, which isn't very different from that seen in Q1 2024.\n\nThe company\u2019s operating profits are also seen growing at a fast clip, with 26% increase seen at the midpoint of the guidance range, which is lower than the 30% CER rise seen in Q1 2024. However, it may well come in at the top end of the range, in line with the last quarter.\n\nAssuming however, that the operating profit does come in at the midpoint of the range and the ratio of net profit to operating profit remains at ~80%, the same as in Q1 2024, the net profit would come to DKK 103.1 billion. This is also a healthy growth of 23.2% YoY.\n\nSource: Novo Nordisk\n\nRising challenges\n\nHowever, while all appears to be going very well for Novo Nordisk, challenges are visible too. Here are three of them:\n\n#1. Health risks: While there are good reviews available for both the Ozempic and Wegovy, they have also come under fire recently. Some 7-9% of users of these treatments are seen as at risk of nothing short of blindness. To be fair, some risk exists even for alternate medications. But it's a comparatively far lower rate of 0.8-1.8%.\n\n#2. Prices in the US: The company, along with Eli Lilly, has also come under fire for charging \u201cunconscionably high prices\u201d in the US by none other than President Biden. In an opinion article for USA Today earlier this week, he points out that if prescribed by a doctor, \u201c\u2026 the prices of Ozempic and Wegovy can be up to six times higher than prices in Canada, Germany, Denmark and other major countries.\u201d.\n\nThe upshot of the article for Novo Nordisk is essentially that its margins could be set for a decline in the US, which isn't trivial either. The US is the biggest market for Novo Nordisk, with a 63% contribution to sales as of 2023. It\u2019s also worth adding that the company\u2019s EBIT margin at 44.1% in 2023 was significantly ahead of its biggest peers by market capitalisation. Even Eli Lilly, which comes next, for example, had a far lower margin of 31.6% during the year.\n\n#3. Rising competition: Finally, the success of its treatments and the big market for weight management is set to increase competition as well. Last month, the Swiss pharmaceutical stock Roche Holding AG (OTCQX:RHHBY) made gains on positive results from its weight management treatment\u2019s clinical trials. Also, after a disappointment last year on its obesity treatment\u2019s side effects, Pfizer (PFE) is now testing three new drugs too. While these treatments will take their time to come to market, the fact is that Novo Nordisk\u2019s sales growth may well slow down over time as a result.\n\nSteep market multiples\n\nWith a price rise of 40% year-to-date [YTD}, Novo Nordisk\u2019s market multiples aren\u2019t looking attractive right now. Based on the estimate for net income made earlier, the forward GAAP price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio comes to 41.5x. This is not just substantially higher than the average of 27.1x for the healthcare sector but also the stock\u2019s own five-year average of 30.5x.\n\nHowever, the forward ratio is for the year 2024. Since we are midway through, it\u2019s also worthwhile to look at the ratio for 2025. This is improved, at 32.7x, as per the average of analysts\u2019 estimates on Seeking Alpha, but not enough to make it attractive.\n\nWhat next?\n\nUnless the company upgrades its earnings outlook again, for now, it\u2019s hard to make a Buy case for Novo Nordisk. Even if it does make an upgrade, the gap between the company\u2019s past average and current forward P/E is so big, it might still indicate overvaluation.\n\nIn any case, it remains to be seen whether another revision even happens, after President Biden has been critical of its prices, which could impact margins going forward. Whether or not it happens is debatable as the US goes to elections later this year, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind. Rising competition over time among weight management products can be another drag on the company.\n\nThat said, though, for now it looks very good fundamentally. Specifically, Ozempic is hugely popular even as its side effects are becoming increasingly known. It\u2019s a big contributor to Novo Nordisk\u2019s sales, which are expected to continue being healthy going forward into the year and for now its margins look strong too. It\u2019s a pity, really, for investors who\u2019d like to buy the stock. But it\u2019s worth watching and buying on significant dips. I\u2019m going with a Hold on Novo Nordisk.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "body": "ArtistGNDphotography\n\nAs the largest supplier of structural building products in the United States, we think Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) is well-positioned to continue taking share in the fragmented Building Products industry, should benefit from long-term structural growth tailwinds in housing construction.\n\nIn our view, the company's ability to grow inorganically, via both large acquisitions and strategic tuck-ins, underscores management\u2019s strong track record of capital allocation as well as the company\u2019s ability to grow through the cycle.\n\nWe also believe that management's compensation structure aligns closely with shareholder interests, with long-term incentives driven by ROIC and relative shareholder returns vs. a peer group. Moreover, management has shown an ability to consistently capitalize on opportunities to take out cost and improve efficiency.\n\nIn addition to leveraging its strong balance sheet to execute accretive acquisitions, the company has also used excess cash to fund share repurchases \u2013 reducing BLDR\u2019s share count by more than 30% since 2021, as shown in the chart below:\n\nBLDR Total Shares Outstanding (FinChat.io)\n\nWith only about 4% market share across its core markets, we think BLDR has substantial runway for both organic and inorganic growth.\n\nAs such, we are initiating coverage on BLDR with a Buy rating.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nBLDR is a leading supplier and manufacturer of building materials, serving both professionals and consumers across the US.\n\nThe company operates approximately 570 locations across 43 states, offering a vertically integrated solution that includes everything from manufacturing to installation.\n\nBLDR's product portfolio includes materials for roofs, stairs, doors, and windows, including lumber and millwork.\n\nThe below slide from the company\u2019s June 2024 Corporate Presentation provides a nice snapshot of the business:\n\nBLDR Snapshot (Builders FirstSource - June 2024 Corporate Presentation)\n\nBLDR's value-added products and services, which include manufactured components and installation services, account for more than 50% of the company\u2019s net sales and support its industry-leading gross margins of around 35%.\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t many perfect public comps for BLDR (most of their direct competitors are private, like ABC Supply Co. and 84 Lumber), the below compares BLDR\u2019s gross margins to a few publicly traded comps over the last 10 years (through the end of 1Q24):\n\nBLDR Gross Margins vs. Peers (Koyfin)\n\nBLDR has also grown significantly through acquisitions, notably including the purchase of ProBuild in 2015 as well as the company\u2019s merger with BMC in 2021. In our view, these transformational mergers and acquisitions have significantly expanded BLDR's geographic reach and enhanced its value-added product offerings.\n\nIn addition to the larger transformational deals, BLDR has consistently pursued tuck-in acquisitions to expand its geographic reach and enhance its product offerings. Many of these smaller deals have allowed BLDR to enter new markets, increase its market share in existing areas, and add complementary products and services. For example, BLDR\u2019s acquisition of WTS Paradigm in August 2021 bolstered the company\u2019s capabilities in housing design software and services, further integrating BLDR into the homebuilding process.\n\nBLDR's acquisition strategy has both driven growth and improved operational efficiency. The company has leveraged its increased scale to reduce costs, with initiatives including truss plant automation, price optimization, warehouse automation, and delivery optimization.\n\nThe slide below outlines BLDR\u2019s productivity achievements in 2022 and 2023, as well as the company\u2019s near-term efficiency targets, which we think underscores management\u2019s ability to both successfully extract synergies from acquisitions while constantly looking for areas to reduce or take out unnecessary costs.\n\nBLDR's Productivity Gains & Near-Term Efficiency Targets (Builders FirstSource - June 2024 Corporate Presentation)\n\nThe company has consistently maintained a high ROIC, and currently has one of the best ROIC's in the industry, relative to its publicly traded comp set.\n\nBLDR's ROIC vs. Peers (Koyfin)\n\nIn our view, the company\u2019s disciplined approach to integrating acquisitions and extracting synergies has been a major factor in BLDR's ability to maintain industry-leading margins and returns on invested capital.\n\nFinancials\n\nIn Q1 2024, BLDR reported net sales of $3.9bn, a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year. While commodity price deflation of 1.7% and weakness in multifamily and repair and remodel segments impacted results, this was offset by 1.9% growth from acquisitions and strength in single-family starts.\n\nGross profit for the quarter was $1.3bn, with a gross margin of 33.4%, down slightly from 35.3% in Q1 2023. According to management, the margin decrease was primarily due to a shift in product mix towards lower-margin early-stage home building products and normalization in the multifamily segment.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Q1 2024 was $541 million, representing a 14.4% decrease year-over-year.\n\nWe recognize that this certainly wasn't the company's best quarter, but we're encouraged by BLDR's ability to maintain solid profitability, with a mid-teens EBITDA margin, even in what's proven to be a very challenging environment.\n\nImportantly, the company's balance sheet remains solid, with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.1x as of Q1 2024. We think the company's conservative leverage profile should provide the flexibility necessary to fund future acquisitions and share repurchases.\n\nWhile it's important to follow quarterly earnings, we are much more focused on the long-term picture.\n\nEven after a challenging 2023, BLDR still boasts laudable 10-year revenue and EBITDA CAGRs of ~30% and 53%, respectively, as shown in the chart below.\n\nBLDR's 10-Year Revenue & EBITDA Growth (FinChat.io)\n\nAnd for those wondering, the CAGR figures reference above are nearly identical to the period from 2014-2020, which excludes BLDR's merger with BMC.\n\nWe think the company's long-term track record of growth, profitability, and capital allocation depict a business that can grow through the cycle and weather downturns, emerging on stronger footing.\n\nAs such, we aren't spooked by the company's disappointing Q1 results.\n\nValuation\n\nBLDR currently trades at around 7.9x NTM EV/EBITDA, which is near the middle of the pack relative to its publicly traded peers. Given BLDR's superior fundamentals, we think the company probably deserves to trade at a premium to some of these peers.\n\nBLDR NTM EV/EBITDA vs. Peers (Koyfin)\n\nPrior to the company's merger with BMC, BLDR was compounding revenues and EBITDA at a clip of around 30% and 50%, respectively.\n\nEven if we assume the company grows at half that rate for the next 5 years, and because of that lower growth profile it trades an EV/EBITDA multiple of about -1 standard deviation from its 5-year mean (which would be approximately 4x), it's hard for us not to get excited about BLDR's current valuation. Even in a Draconian environment where these assumptions prove true, we still think BLDR currently trades at a highly attractive 17% 5-year IRR.\n\nOur analysis is summarized in the table below:\n\nBLDR Fwd 5-Year IRR Projection (FinChat.io; FV Capital Analysis)\n\nRisks\n\nDespite what we view as an attractive setup for long-term investors, our investment thesis for BLDR could be negatively impacted by a number of key risks.\n\nFirst, BLDR\u2019s performance is sensitive to interest rates and economic cycles, and if mortgage rates remain historically high for a prolonged period, this could offset our view on long-term tailwinds for housing demand and lead to an extended period of muted construction activity.\n\nBLDR is also experiencing notable weakness in its multifamily segment, which management expects to continue throughout the year. And although the company has reduced its commodity exposure, lumber still accounts for ~25% of sales, leaving BLDR susceptible to commodity price volatility.\n\nAdditionally, BLDR's growth strategy relies heavily on successful integration of acquisitions and execution of its shift towards higher-margin, value-added products. Missteps by management in these areas or in capital allocation decisions would likely negatively impact future growth and profitability.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nDespite recent short-term headwinds, we think BLDR presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity at current levels.\n\nAs the leading building products' distributor in a fragmented market, we think BLDR is well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term structural growth in housing construction.\n\nThe company's proven track record of successful inorganic growth, its focus on high margin value-added products, and consistent operational improvements underscore management's ability to drive growth and profitability.\n\nIn our view, BLDR's conservative balance sheet, strong and consistent profitability and growth, and its attractive valuation relative to both its publicly traded peers and to its long-term growth potential, justify our Buy rating on the stock.",

        "title": "CureVac: GSK's Deal Is A Long-Shot (NASDAQ:CVAC)",
        "body": "urbazon/E+ via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Overview\n\nThe share price of CureVac (NASDAQ:CVAC), the T\u00fcbingen, Germany-based biotech whose long-term focus has been on \"developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA\", has experienced a torrid few years, down >90% on a five-year basis.\n\nI first covered the company for Seeking Alpha back in January 2021, when CureVac's share price traded at $100, and the company's market cap valuation was ~$17bn. CureVac closed its initial public offering of 15.3m shares at a price of $16 in August 2020, earning the company $245.3m.\n\nCureVac stock initially made stratospheric gains as the company looked to have developed an mRNA-based vaccine against COVID that could potentially be the equal of Moderna's (MRNA) SpikeVax, or Pfizer (PFE) and another German mRNA specialist, BioNTech's (BNTX) Comirnaty - two drugs which went on to drive well over >$100bn of revenues selling their product to governments around the world.\n\nCureVac ran a 40k patient study of its vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, but in June 2021, announced that the efficacy of the vaccine had fallen a long way short of matching SpikeVax and Comirnaty, which were shown to be >90% effective in their respective clinical studies. CureVac's shot achieved a figure of just 47%.\n\nThat meant the company missed out entirely on the massive revenues - and profits - earned by mRNA rivals Moderna and BioNTech, and as a result, by February 2022, its share price had fallen to ~$15, down >85% in less than one year.\n\nCureVac continued to work developing mRNA drugs, including a \"cancer vaccine\", and COVID and influenza vaccines - fields of development in which Moderna and BioNTech were also active, but a lack of any genuinely compelling progress meant the company's share price remained flat.\n\nIn January 2023, CureVac announced the appointment of a new CEO, the ex-Sanofi (SNY) executive Alexander Zehnder, and in July, announced the departure of its Chief Scientific Officer (\"CSO\"), Dr. Igor Splawski. At the end of 2023, CureVac stock suffered another blow when a court in Germany ruled against the company in its ongoing patent dispute with BioNTech - CureVac had been trying to argue that Comirnaty infringed some of its own mRNA vaccine patents.\n\nIn 2024, CureVac announced plans to complete a business restructuring which include the loss of 150 jobs. As of the end of 2023, the company reported ~$420m of cash, a net loss for the year of ~$(93.5m), down from $(140m) in the prior year, and presented its pipeline as shown below in an investor presentation dated last month:\n\nCureVac pipeline as of YE23 (presentation)\n\nBreaking News - GSK Purchases Key Vaccine Candidates, Hands CureVac Financial Lifeline\n\nAs we can see from the slide above, CureVac had been developing its prophylactic vaccine candidates alongside a partner, the UK based Pharma giant GSK (GSK), however CureVac made the announcement yesterday that GSK will:\n\nassume full control of developing and manufacturing these candidate vaccines. GSK will have worldwide rights to commercialise the candidate vaccines. The agreement represents the latest step in GSK\u2019s ongoing investment in vaccine platform technologies, matching the best platform to each pathogen to develop best-in-class vaccines.\n\nIn exchange, CureVac says it will:\n\nreceive an upfront payment of \u20ac400 million and up to an additional \u20ac1.05 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestones and tiered royalties in the high single to low teens range. The new agreement replaces all previous financial considerations from the prior collaboration agreement between GSK and CureVac.\n\nThe \u20ac400 million - ~$431m based on current exchange rates - will help support the company as it continues its restructuring - as of Q1 2024, CureVac reported ~$323m of cash, and a net loss of ~$(76m).\n\nIn fact, CureVac made a second announcement yesterday following on from the GSK deal news, discussing \"a significant strategic restructuring\", which will result in 30% of its workforce being jettisoned. CEO Zehnder commented:\n\nNow, we can embark on a new chapter for CureVac. The new GSK agreement not only provides substantial financing but also allows us to streamline our operations and focus on technology innovation, research, and development. It enables us to prioritize our oncology programs and further leverage our technology in other areas where mRNA is uniquely suited to develop novel treatment approaches. While the approximately 30% workforce reduction is a difficult decision on a personal level, I am convinced that this is a necessary step to ensure the long-term success of CureVac.\n\nCureVac says the restructuring will decrease operational expenses by 30% from \"2025 onward\", and provide a funding runway until 2028, and has promised more updates when its Q3 earnings in November this year.\n\nAnalysis - A Deal That Suits Both Parties Short-Term, But Doubts Over Long-Term Benefits\n\nMy initial thoughts on this deal is that it seems to suit both parties, in the short term, at least. GSK has acquired a clinical stage portfolio of mRNA vaccine candidates, although CureVac retains ownership of the preclinical assets.\n\nGSK will doubtless want to pitch its now wholly owned COVID candidate into an emerging market for private, as opposed to government sponsored COVID vaccination, a market it will hope becomes endemic and, perhaps, one day matches the influenza market in size. Estimates suggest influenza jabs are a ~$9bn per annum market, potentially rising to >$20bn next decade (I would take that forecast with a pinch of salt, personally).\n\nGSK also gains full control of an influenza candidate, albeit one that is struggling somewhat to meet criteria for approval. Like rival Moderna's flu jab, CureVac - now GSK's - shot is effective against Influenza A strains, but less so against B strains (according to data released in April this year), which may be problematic in terms of securing approval.\n\nNevertheless, GSK, which has its own flu jab, Fluarix, may have opted to take full control of CureVac's programs as it sees Moderna's mRNA candidate as a genuine threat to Fluarix, which can be countered if it develops an mRNA vaccine of its own.\n\nCureVac's unimpressive track record against the likes of Moderna and BioNTech, Pfizer and other vaccine developers to date, suggests to me that GSK is taking something of a risk by paying $400m upfront for two Phase 2 stage assets, but it's possible GSK feels that CureVac's mRNA technology platform is sound, while its management / execution of the clinical development / approval process has been found wanting.\n\nWith its vastly superior resources, experience, and infrastructure, GSK may feel it can succeed with CureVac's platform where CureVac itself could not. GSK is, after all, a vaccine giant whose Singrix vaccine against shingles earned ~$4.5bn of revenues last year.\n\nFrom CureVac's perspective, management may feel it has done well to secure even $400m for two assets that are losing the race to market against vaccines developed by Moderna, and others. The company may develop its early stage infectious disease vaccines; however, it seems as though, like its rival BioNTech, CureVac wants to focus on oncology above all else.\n\nI covered BioNTech and the company's ambitious plans to secure 10 oncology drug approvals by 2030 in a note for Seeking Alpha last month. BioNTech has a deep and evolving pipeline of opportunities, but I was a little sceptical on tangibles signs of progress, and am inclined to believe that Comirnaty remains the main driver of value at that company, as opposed to oncology.\n\nWhile BioNTech boasts ~$13bn cash thanks to its Comirnaty windfall, CureVac does not have anything like the same funding, with an accumulated deficit of ~$1.73bn, hence it is hardly surprising the company's market cap valuation is <$700m, where BioNTech's is ~$19bn.\n\nCureVac has only a single oncology asset in the clinic in CVGBM, which is progressing through a Phase 1 study in glioblastoma (brain cancer), with a data readout promised for the H2 2024. The company also says it expects its GMP manufacturing facility to be completed in H2 2024.\n\nThe idea of a \"cancer vaccine\" - not really a vaccine at all, but a custom-made injection for patients based on circulating tumor DNA found in their bloodstream, which uses mRNA to teach the immune system to recognise and destroy such antigens, is an intriguing one, but yet again, CureVac finds itself some way behind both Moderna and BioNTech in this field.\n\nModerna is chasing approval to treat melanoma with such a drug, in combo with Merck's Keytruda, after generating results suggesting the combo can reduce risk of recurrence of death by 49%, while BioNTech is advancing prospects in partnership with Swiss Pharma giant Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) drug development subsidiary Genentech.\n\nLooking Ahead - Does GSK Deal Offer CureVac Hope Of A Fresh Beginning?\n\nOn balance, I'd say the outlook for CureVac after its latest two announcements has not necessarily materially improved. Until early June, CureVac shares had been rising in value, however most likely in response to new cases of avian flu being identified, raising fears of a new and potentially widespread infectious disease breakout.\n\nCureVac stock had risen from $2.3 per share, to $5 per share between April and early June, but fading fears have seen the stock fall again, and the response to yesterday's news has been initially negative - shares are down ~7% this week.\n\nIn many ways, CureVac faces the same problem as it has done for most of the past 5 years - its pace of development has been slower than the likes of Moderna / BioNTech and the prospect of securing commercial approval for any asset seems remote at this time.\n\nIt's difficult to assess the value of the assets sold to GSK, but again, my suspicion would be that GSK wanted the license and patent protection that comes with the mRNA vaccine candidates, and is backing itself to make more headway in the clinical trial / approval process than CureVac was able to do, thanks to its superior experience in the vaccine industry.\n\nCureVac has some partners of note in the MD Anderson Cancer Center, and in the field of molecular therapies, Genmab (GMAB), the Danish Pharma, and CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), however these are early-stage programs in tricky indications where the prospects for success are quite remote.\n\nCureVac's best shot at recovering some share price value for its beleaguered shareholders may still come from its patent disputes with BioNTech - the company insists that independent analysis shows it has the \"strongest patents in mRNA vaccine technology\", and there is plenty of additional data shared in a recent investor presentation, however to date, the courts have not sided with CureVac, and legal proceedings can be costly.\n\nI would expect CureVac to potentially secure a chuck - ~$500m, perhaps - of the milestone payments pledged by GSK, and royalties on revenues from an approved COVID or influenza vaccine, however I suspect this outcome may already be baked into the company's share price, as usually, a biotech with only two early stage clinical stage assets would struggle to justify a ~$700m market cap. $200m - $500m would be a more realistic assessment.\n\nAs such, although I think management has likely done the right thing by agreeing this deal with GSK, and letting go ~30% of its >1k staff, and believe the company and management has been a little unlucky as it has clearly been a player of genuine significance in the emergence of the mRNA field of drug development, I suspect that operationally, clinically, and in terms of its valuation, things may still have to get worse, before they can get better.\n\nHence, a \"sell\" recommendation on this occasion, but a company worth keeping an eye on as a sell prospect can rapidly become an intriguing contrarian trade under the right circumstances, such as a good set of clinical data or a notable breakthrough in a fast-developing field that is still regarded as one of the most exciting in biotech.",
        "summary": "CureVac closed its initial public offering of 15.3m shares at a price of $16 in August 2020, earning the company $245.3m.\nThe new agreement replaces all previous financial considerations from the prior collaboration agreement between GSK and CureVac.\nGSK has acquired a clinical stage portfolio of mRNA vaccine candidates, although CureVac retains ownership of the preclinical assets.\nThe company may develop its early stage infectious disease vaccines; however, it seems as though, like its rival BioNTech, CureVac wants to focus on oncology above all else.\nLooking Ahead - Does GSK Deal Offer CureVac Hope Of A Fresh Beginning?",

        "body": "SoftBank Group shares hit a record high on Thursday, just as the company\u2019s massive tech investment arm shows signs of recovery and its outspoken founder Masayoshi Son emerged back into the public spotlight to align the Japanese giant to a future in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe firm has also been helped by the public market success of British chip designer Arm, in which Softbank has a majority stake.\n\nShares of the Japanese giant closed at a record high of 11,190.00 Japanese yen on Thursday \u2014 a far cry from the dotcom crash of the early 2000s and a more recent downturn for the company during the tech market troubles of 2021 and 2022.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s journey to the peak\n\nSon founded SoftBank in 1981, back when the company distributed software. It went public in Japan in 1994, and, amid the internet boom, made a $2 million investment in Yahoo in the middle of that decade.\n\nThat started off the company\u2019s tech investments.\n\nThe rise of the internet and of Yahoo pushed SoftBank\u2019s stock to a peak closing price of 10,111.1 yen on Feb. 18, 2000. Three days prior, the firm\u2019s shares had hit an intraday high of 11,000 yen.\n\nAs internet stocks came crashing down, so too did SoftBank\u2019s share price, which at one point sank more than 90% below its dotcom peak.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until nearly 21 years later, on Feb. 16, 2021, that SoftBank exceeded its previous record-high close.\n\nVision Fund\n\nThe recent rise to a share price peak has been volatile since Son positioned SoftBank as a visionary pioneer with the 2017 launch of a massive technology investment arm \u2014 the Vision Fund.\n\nSoftBank made dozens of bets on tech companies across the world, some of which turned sour. Office sharing startup WeWork was perhaps among the highest-profile names. But some of SoftBank\u2019s investments in Chinese firms also took a hit after Beijing kicked off its crackdown on the domestic tech sector at the end of 2020.\n\nAfter lingering near then-record highs in March 2021, SoftBank\u2019s stock fell sharply, alongside other global tech stocks. The Vision Fund posted then-record financial losses in 2022. Son said that SoftBank would go into \u201cdefense\u201d mode and be more conservative with its investments. He changed tack shortly after the Vision Fund posted a record $32 billion loss in 2023, saying that the company would now shift into \u201coffense,\u201d because he was excited about the investment opportunities in AI.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s share price began a recovery from around May 2023, and the Japanese titan\u2019s Vision Fund more recently posted better financials amid broader tech stock recoveries.\n\n\u201cSoftbank Vision Fund had to write down various investments due to a combination of equity values declining and a tougher private financing environment. It looks like the write down cycle is mostly done, and there is a good chance that the IPO market will be more constructive going forward, especially for AI related investments,\u201d Oliver Matthew, head of Asian consumer research at CLSA, told CNBC by email.\n\nArm chip boost\n\nSeveral analysts attributed SoftBank\u2019s recent share price bump of around 78% in the year to date to the IPO success of Arm, which it acquired in 2016.\n\nSoftBank owns roughly 90% of Arm even after the listing. Arm shares are up nearly 124% alone this year, as of the close on July 3.\n\n\u201cSoftBank Group\u2019s investment strategy and focus has long included the development of an AI ecosystem portfolio, long before the LLM (large language model)-driven bull cycle in AI-related names over the last 18 months or so,\u201d Paul Golding, senior U.S. lifestyle and payments analyst at Macquarie U.S. equity research, told CNBC by email.\n\n\u201cThis vision, in our view, likely drove some of the investment decision in 2016 to acquire Arm, giving SoftBank Group direct exposure to semiconductor market dynamics and ownership of intellectual property around semiconductor design well ahead of broader progress in AI use-cases and platforms.\u201d\n\nSoftBank shares \u201chave been benefitting from this vis-\u00e0-vis well-publicized\u201d uses for Arm intellectual property, such as in the automotive industry or cloud data center, Golding added.\n\nDo investors believe the SoftBank story?\n\nOver the years, investors have focused on whether SoftBank Group\u2019s valuation fairly reflects the assets it is invested in or holds.\n\nFor example, SoftBank\u2019s valuation is around $101.5 billion. Arm\u2019s market capitalization is around $176 billion \u2014 meaning that SoftBank\u2019s 90% stake is equivalent to about $158 billion of that figure. That alone is significantly above SoftBank Group\u2019s overall valuation, without taking into account the company\u2019s other holdings and businesses, such as its telecommunications arm.\n\nAnalysts cite this as a reason why SoftBank\u2019s share price does not reflect its fair value.\n\nDan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said a lot of SoftBank\u2019s price appreciation comes down to Arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that investors are convinced by the SoftBank story again,\u201d Baker told CNBC by email, adding that this year\u2019s share gain is \u201cprimarily\u201d because Arm stock has risen, while the Japanese yen has weakened. Baker said it is worth looking at the so-called sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which ascribes value to the various parts of SoftBank\u2019s holdings to figure what the company is worth. Baker said the SOTP valuation remains just under 50% this year, meaning SoftBank\u2019s stock does not truly reflect the value of its various businesses and investments.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure that investors are \u2018buying the SoftBank story\u2019 but investors are certainly buying the ARM story,\u201d Baker said.\n\nInvestors have also cheered the fact that SoftBank has sold practically all of its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that Son backed in 2000.\n\nSoftBank has also likely been helped by a recent broader rise in Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei 225 Index up 22% this year alone as of Thursday.\n\nArtificial super intelligence\n\nBut can Son\u2019s focus on AI boost SoftBank\u2019s value further and close the discount to its basket of assets?\n\nThe SoftBank founder, who has been out of the public spotlight in the last year, recently spoke about his excitement over the future of AI and how SoftBank can be at the center of this technology with its investment in companies like Arm.\n\nSon last month laid out his vision for a world featuring what he dubbed as artificial super intelligence, or ASI, which would be 10,000 times smarter than humans.\n\nIt comes at a time when investors are feverishly looking at how to play the AI boom, with the parabolic rise of Nvidia\u2019s stock price underscoring the excitement around the technology.\n\nCLSA\u2019s Matthew said SoftBank\u2019s discount could reduce, going forward, thanks to some of the company\u2019s early AI investments.\n\n\u201cSoftbank has been absolutely consistent about its investment direction; they were among the earliest investors behind the AI theme, and in some ways too early so many investors thought they were overpaying, or buying into certain companies where it wasn\u2019t clear how AI was related,\u201d Matthew said.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Softbank Group shares trade at a surprisingly wide discount to its fair value, and we believe this discount will narrow in the future.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/softbank-shares-hit-record-high-after-24-years-on-arm-and-ai-boost.html",

        "body": "Addus HomeCare (ADUS) provides care at home for the elderly and others at risk of being institutionalized to keep them out of expensive hospitals and nursing homes. 75% of their revenue comes from non-medical personal care which includes: housekeeping, laundry services and meal preparation.\n\nI hold this stock because, (with only 50K customers currently served), there are incredible opportunities for growth. And this potential does not seem to be fully priced in yet, with a p/e ratio under 30 and very low debt.\n\nThe elderly population in the USA is rapidly increasing. Next year, in 2025, there will be 63 million Americans over the age of 65. 5 years later, that number will increase to 71 million. The elderly will make up over 20% of the US population by then.\n\nThe population is also becoming increasingly unhealthy and less able-bodied. This is true across all age groups, including the elderly. Let's look at 2 examples of this:\n\nThe federal reserve keeps excellent track of the health of the civilian labor force. In January 2020, before the pandemic, there were 6.2 million with long term disabilities. By May 2024, that number increased by 37% to 8.5 million. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU01074597 Covid infections increase the risk of dementia by 60% 12 months after infection. And there are still waves every 6 to 12 months. The cumulative effect of repeat infections will increase the dementia burden. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4716751\n\nSo, there is a rapidly increasing elderly population. And, that population is becoming increasingly unhealthy and less able to take care of themselves. Demand for home care services will be very strong in the coming years.\n\nAlso, there is an enormous cost benefit. Regular home care services are roughly 1/3 of the cost of living in a nursing home. And they have been found to delay nursing home admission by an average of 3 years. This cost reduction incentivizes insurance providers and the customers themselves to choose home care rather than the costly alternatives.\n\nA future potential headwind for volume growth is that it could be limited by labor shortages. Fortunately, the labor situation in the health care and social assistance has been steadily improving since 2022: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTS6200JOR\n\nRevenue growth has been above 10% since 2021, including 11.6% in the most recent quarter. And margins have been improving slightly too.\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback. What are some downsides of ADUS that I haven't covered? Thanks.",

It's not clear to me (or many others) as to whether it will ultimately depress the B share stock price further in the near-term due to dilution or if it's actually better than the average shareholder realizes.\n\nI ran it through ChatGPT (I know, I know...no one firsthand available to ask) to try and just get a sense since it's unlike most merger/buyout transactions I've ever seen, but I don't know if I'm even looking at it correctly. Depending on factors such as share \u201cbuybacks\u201d (whether it remains part of the float) or amount shares are issued (current stock price up to $15), GPT\u2019s estimations run between $9 - $15, roughly.\n\nWould anyone with more experience in M&A or finance have any thoughts? Willing to crunch their own numbers or give their own predictions/ranges?\n\nParamount Stock Details\n\nA Shares: 84.71 million\n\nA Share Price = $20.10\n\nB Shares: 613 million\n\nB Share Price = $11.45\n\nTotal Shares Outstanding: 697.71 million\n\nCurrent Market Cap = $7.6B\n\nDeal Details\n\n-$1.5 billion to pay down Paramount\u2019s $12.2 billion of net debt, in order to elevate it to investment grade.\n\n-$4.5 billion offered to the non-Redstone shareholders, spread across all the shareholders who elect to sell, on a pro-rata basis.

        "body": "Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nTotal deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles\n\nTotal production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles\n\nTesla\u2019s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.\n\nTroy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories \u2014 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles \u2014 but doesn\u2019t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.\n\nTesla\u2019s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.\n\nIn April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, \u201cprimarily due to lower average selling price.\u201d\n\nSluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla\u2019s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.\n\nBut the sales drop also correlated with Tesla\u2019s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d and \u201cpolitical rants.\u201d\n\nTesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.\n\nTesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.\n\nIn China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.\n\nColin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees \u201cdeclining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.\u201d He recommends selling Tesla shares.\n\nWells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the \u201clikelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes\u201d as the year continues.\n\nInvestor focus will now shift to Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or \u201cCyberCab.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/tesla-tsla-q2-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html",

        "body": "General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.\n\nThe Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIts EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.\n\nSales of GM\u2019s full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.\n\nGM\u2019s total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.\n\nGM\u2019s second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.\n\nAn unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.\n\n\u201cThe CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds\u2019 head of insights.\n\nGM, in a statement, said its \u201cdealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.\u201d\n\nDealers, including the industry\u2019s largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.\n\nAll six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six \u2014 Asbury Automotive Group, AutoNation Inc., Group 1 Automotive Inc., Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. \u2014 use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.\n\n\u201cThe good news is \u2014 unlike other black swan events that the industry has contended with in the past \u2014 sales shouldn\u2019t be lost or severely deferred, but rather pushed into the third quarter,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Toyota reported its second-quarter sales. The company\u2019s U.S. sales totaled 621,549 vehicles during the period, up 9.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nThe Hyundai brand sold 214,719 vehicles during the second quarter, up 2.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nKia, which reports sales on a monthly basis, reported a 6.5% decrease in its June sales. Its sales for the first half of the year were down about 2% to 386,460 vehicles sold.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/gm-q2-2024-auto-sales.html",

        "body": "The U.S. stock market just scored a gangbusters first half of the year. If history is a guide, Wall street could be in for another robust six months, according to Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, up nearly 15% in the first six months of 2024, set a new record close for the first time in more than two years in January and since then has achieved 31 fresh all-time highs, a pace that equates to a new record close on roughly one of every three trading days, said a team of Comerica analysts led by John Lynch, chief investment officer.\n\nThe large-cap benchmark index also booked one of its best starts to the year ever. Its nearly 15% return through the end of June ranks as the 13th best start for the S&P 500 since 1950.\n\nHistory suggests that fast opening halves of the year generally maintain their momentum through the second half, Lynch and his team said in a Monday note.\n\nSince 1990, there have been only 10 occasions where the S&P 500 has achieved a return greater than 10% in the first half of a year. In each instance, the large-cap benchmark index booked a positive return in the second half of the year, averaging a 10.8% return over the next six months and a 14.2% advance over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Comerica (see chart below).\n\nSOURCE: BLOOMBERG LP, COMERICA WEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, presidential election years, particularly those where the incumbent president is running for re-election, also provide tailwinds for the stock market, the analysts said. \u201cRe-election years usually benefit from fiscal stimulus, which provides a cushion for equity markets.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has gained in every presidential re-election year since 1944 (see chart below), but this year\u2019s performance would still \u201cstand out\u201d because stocks \u201care not usually strong\u201d in the early parts of election years, said Lynch and his team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typically the second half of the year that produces the strongest gains,\u201d they wrote.",

I started trading options about a year ago, and today, I hit a massive win \u2013 a 2300% gain on SOUN options! I\u2019ve attached a screenshot for proof because even I can hardly believe it.\n\nMay of 2024\n\nThis experience has been nothing short of a rollercoaster, and I\u2019d love to hear from others who are also navigating the wild world of options trading. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned pro or just getting started, let\u2019s share our biggest gains and losses, and what we\u2019ve learned along the way.\n\nMy Journey So Far:\n\nWhen I first dipped my toes into options trading, I was overwhelmed by all the jargon and strategies. Terms like calls, puts, spreads, and Greeks felt like a foreign language. But I was determined to learn, so I dove into countless hours of YouTube tutorials, books, and forums.\n\nMy first few trades were a mix of small wins and painful losses. I quickly learned that options can be incredibly volatile and that a single bad trade can wipe out several good ones. It was a humbling experience, but it also taught me the importance of risk management that I did not utilize properly for years.\n\nThe Big Win:\n\nThe trade that brought me the 2300% gain was on SOUN. I had been following the stock for a while and noticed some patterns in its price movements. After doing my research, I decided to buy call options, betting that the stock would rise. I had no idea it would explode the way it did.\n\nWhen I saw the stock start to climb, my adrenaline was through the roof. I kept a close eye on it, and as it soared, so did the value of my options. When I finally sold, I was sitting on a 2300% gain. It was a surreal moment simply a mix of disbelief and happiness lol.\n\nWhat did I learn from this:\n\nDo Your Research: Understanding the stock and the market conditions is crucial. Blindly buying options based on tips or hunches can lead to disaster. Risk Management: Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-losses and take-profits to protect your capital. Stay Calm: Options trading can be incredibly emotional. It's essential to stay calm and stick to your strategy, even when the market is volatile. Continuous Learning: The market is always changing, and there\u2019s always something new to learn. Keep educating yourself and stay updated on market trends.\n\nWould love to know about your experiences:\n\nWhat was your first options trade, and how did it go?\n\nHave you ever had a trade go spectacularly right or disastrously wrong?\n\nWhat resources or strategies have helped you the most in your options trading journey?\n\nHow do you handle the emotional highs and lows of trading?\n\nLets roll..",

You\u2019re supposed to be my guy!\n\nIf you\u2019ve been long with Unity Software ($U) for a while now, I\u2019m sorry about the hit its taken on your portfolio YTD.\n\nHowever, I come to give the trading community of Reddit some reassurance as to why there\u2019s still upside to be had with these guys - and this is the most ideal time to buy.\n\nUnity Software Inc. is most-known for their software products that provide real-time 3D content to video game developers.\n\nTheir technology, the Unity Engine, is spread across various product/subscription options offered by the company, and is responsible for the development of popular games such as Among Us, Subnautica, Rust, Cuphead, and free or cheap-to-play games.\n\nTheir most notable products are known as Unity Pro (for professional game developers), Unity Plus (for indie games), Unity Ads (for monetization of your web service) and more. These products span further than the video-game industry, garnering their artificial intelligence development within the automotive, film, and engineering industries as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique is Unity Software\u2019s business model - the business is split into Operate Solutions, which is responsible for their ad revenue, in-app purchases and other tools, Create Solutions (where revenue is driven from the Unity Engine), and Strategic Partnerships.\n\nOver the last two years, the Create Solutions segment has been the largest source of income to the revenue figure. However, the growth rate of that revenue figure is crashing\u2026\n\n25.23% growth from 2021 to 2022, 15.11% from 2022 to 2023, and a 32% decrease from their year-open share price of $38.79/share are all terrible nods from the fundamental section.\n\nFurthermore, Unity\u2019s EBITDA and free cash flow have seen significant increases over the course of 2024 as well.\n\nBut a popular AI/Software stock researcher and I still speculate this is a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity.\n\nA primary speculative reason for the fall of $U is the raised subscription service cost. Developers who use Unity Software to develop and distribute their games have to pay a subscription fee for the distribution and development.\n\nTowards the end of 2023, interim CEO Jim Whitehurst raised the subscription fee on the developers using their engine to make gains, ultimately driving a short spurt to the revenue figure.\n\nAlthough it did give a boost to the total, this added charge pissed off a LOT of developers, causing $U to fall all the way down to where we are today - a mere $16/share, after Unity reported an EPS of -$1.83 for their shareholders in 2023.\n\nAll of that said, the bad man is now gone everybody\u2026\n\nTomorrow, 7/3, Matt Bromberg will take the reins of Unity Software Inc. as the newly appointed president and CEO.\n\nBromberg brings over 20 years of service in the gaming industry as he is formerly the COO of Zynga, and had other leadership positions before this with Electronic Arts.\n\nBefore both of these ventures, Bromberg served as the President and CEO of Major League Gaming, where he played a monster role in the esports revolution.\n\nWhile running the show at Unity, Bromberg will continue to hold his positions at Monzo, Blast, and Fitbit, which are all tech companies spanning across various market sectors.\n\nBromberg has a heart for the gamer, not to mention, their developers - and its alleged his plan is to lower the fee on their subscription service to open the gates to the next \u201cAmong Us\u201d developer.\n\nI personally think \u201cthe falling knife\u201d was caused by lack of customer appreciation from leadership; a change in leadership could be the spark $U needs to light a fire on the bottom wick of the stick ;)\n\nAnalysts are projecting a $0.13 EPS for their Q2 earnings call - a decrease from the previous years projection of $0.17. Unity Software hasn\u2019t missed projections on this front for some time, and have even turned in an average 56% surprise factor since Q2 of last year.\n\nAlthough analysts are projecting a +20% growth in their revenue year-over-year, what will be most interesting to see is if Unity will be able to turn around their plummeting profit margins by the end of the year.\n\nI added shares to my position with $U today, with the change in leadership set to go tomorrow, this might be the last time to \u201cbuy the dip,\u201d and when the next hit mobile game comes out, I\u2019m hoping to have a little \u201ctold-you-so\u201d moment in the back pocket.\n\nIt\u2019s speculation, but it's optimistic.\n\nLet me know if you guys have a position, long or short, with $U 2! (See what I did there again \u263a\ufe0f)\n\nHope you got something valuable here ~ always NFA\n\nSources:\n\n1 2",

Rents have soared in recent years because of housing shortages across much of the country and a bout of severe inflation.\n\nBut a growing number of rental properties, especially in the South and the Southwest, are in financial distress. Only some have stopped making payments on their mortgages, but analysts worry that as many as 20 percent of all loans on apartment properties could be at risk of default.\n\nAlthough rents surged during the pandemic, the rise has stalled in recent months. In many parts of the country, rents are starting to fall. Interest rates, ratcheted higher by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, have made mortgages much more expensive for building owners. And while homes remain scarce in many places, developers may have built too many higher-end apartments in cities that are no longer attracting as many renters as they were in 2021 and 2022, like Houston and Tampa, Fla.\n\nThese problems haven\u2019t yet turned into a crisis, because most owners of apartment buildings, known in the real estate industry as multifamily properties, haven\u2019t fallen behind on loan payments.",

While they have felt the bite of rapid inflation over the last few years, they are likely to have more wiggle room in their budgets and more options to ease the pain by trading down from name brands to generic, or Whole Foods to Walmart.\n\nPoorer families have had less room to maneuver to avoid the brunt of high prices. Although the job market is strong, with low unemployment and wages that have risen especially rapidly at the bottom of the income scale in recent years, some signs of economic strain have been surfacing among lower-income Americans. Credit card delinquencies have risen, many lower earners report feeling less confident in their own household finances, and companies that serve lower-income groups report that they are under stress.\n\nThe gulf between higher- and lower-income consumers has been widening for years, but it is expected to show up especially clearly in travel this summer. Surveys show that richer households are more optimistic about their ability to take trips, and services that they are more likely to use \u2014 like full-service hotels \u2014 are flourishing.

        "body": "The video posted last year on Chinese social media showed more than 100 Japanese children, supposedly at an elementary school in Shanghai, gathered in their schoolyard. Chinese subtitles quoted two students leading the group as screaming: \u201cShanghai is ours. Soon the whole China will be ours, too.\u201d\n\nThe messages were alarming and infuriating in China, which Japan invaded during World War II. Except that the scene actually took place at an elementary school in Japan. And the students were not stoking hatred of China; they were swearing an oath to play fair at what looked like a sporting event.\n\nThe video wasn\u2019t taken down until after it had been viewed more than 10 million times.\n\nXenophobic online content like the schoolyard video is the subject of debate in China right now. Last week, a Chinese man stabbed a Japanese mother and her son in eastern China. Two weeks earlier, four visiting instructors from a college in Iowa were stabbed in northeastern China. Some Chinese are questioning the role that online speech plays in inciting real-world violence.\n\nChina has the world\u2019s most sophisticated system to censor the internet when it wants to. The government sets strict rules about what can and cannot be said about politics, economics, society and the country\u2019s leadership. Internet companies deploy an army of censors. Private citizens censor themselves, knowing that what they post can get their social media accounts deleted or, worse, land them in jail.",

        "body": "The first vaccine for malaria received major regulatory approval in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t become part of vaccination programs in Africa until 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if it had come faster?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the shots had arrived\n\n9 years ago?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n143,000.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s how many children\u2019s deaths could have been averted.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\n\n\nNurses in countries from Sierra Leone to Cameroon are packing a new vaccine into the coolers they tote to villages for immunization clinics: a shot to protect against malaria, one of the deadliest diseases for children.\n\n\n\nBabies and toddlers in eight countries in the region recently started to get the vaccine as part of their routine childhood shots. Seven other African countries are eagerly awaiting its arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a milestone in global health.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a cautionary tale about a system that is ill equipped to deliver critical tools to the people who need them most. It took decades and at least a billion dollars to reach this point. Even now, only a fraction of the children whose lives are at risk will get the vaccine this year, or next year, or the year after. It\u2019s been clear for some time what went wrong, but almost none of those issues have been fixed. That means that the next desperately needed vaccine stands every chance of running into those same problems. Take, for example, a new vaccine for tuberculosis that started clinical trials a few months ago. If it works as well as hoped, it could save at least a million lives a year. We\u2019ll know by 2028 if it stops tuberculosis infections. But if it follows the same trajectory, it will be at least 2038 before it\u2019s shipped to clinics.\n\n\u201cChildren are receiving the vaccine, and for that, I am the happiest man in the world. But on the other hand, I cannot avoid being dismayed at this inexcusably long delay.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Joe Cohen, co-inventor of the first malaria vaccine\n\nThe U.S. Army started work on a malaria vaccine back in the 1980s, hoping to protect soldiers deployed to the tropics. It teamed up with the drug company GlaxoSmithKline, and together they produced promising prototypes. But the military lost interest after a few years, and that left GSK with a problem. The people who desperately needed a malaria vaccine were in villages in sub-Saharan Africa. They would not be able to pay for a product that would cost millions of dollars to develop. GSK needed an altruistically minded partner. It found one in the nonprofit global health agency PATH, and by the late 1990s they had a vaccine to test. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation put up more than $200 million to test it. The clinical trials were complex, because this was a whole new type of vaccine \u2014 the first ever against a parasite \u2014 delivered to children in places with limited health systems. The process took more than a decade. Finally, in 2014, results showed this vaccine cut severe malaria cases by about a third. This was a successful result, but not as much protection as scientists had hoped to see. Still, GSK and PATH planned a production facility to make millions of doses. Gavi, the organization that procures vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, with funds from donors, would buy them.\n\nThen the Gates Foundation pulled its support.\n\nThere was a shake-up in the malaria division, and the leadership reoriented toward a new goal: eliminating the disease. The new malaria team said the vaccine didn\u2019t work well enough to justify pouring millions more dollars into it. It would be better, they said, to wait for a more effective shot in the future, and in the meantime to fund other strategies, such as genetically modifying mosquitoes.\n\n\u201cIf you go from very enthusiastic to very unenthusiastic and you\u2019re the Gates Foundation, people pay attention.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Robert Newman, former director, Global Malaria Program, W.H.O.\n\nThe decision was driven by researchers who were looking at data. They didn\u2019t factor in that the idea of a vaccine, even one with limited efficacy, would be so important to African parents \u2014 and African governments, which would come to see this as a classic example of a paternalistic donor ignoring their priorities. More than 300,000 children died of malaria that year. The foundation\u2019s announcement shoved the vaccine into limbo \u2014 in ways the foundation today says it did not anticipate.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, we could have communicated more often and more clearly about our decisions and listened more clearly to what the impact of those might have been on other institutions and their decisions.\u201d",

The hubs are meant to accelerate the growth of advanced industries in the United States, such as biomanufacturing, clean energy, artificial intelligence and personalized medicine.\n\nThe program reflects a federal effort to expand America\u2019s science and technology funding beyond Silicon Valley and a few coastal regions, an initiative that Biden administration officials say will help revitalize areas that have traditionally received less government investment. Proponents say the projects will help create \u201cgood-paying\u201d jobs and tap into underutilized pools of workers and resources across the country.\n\nThe $10 billion program was authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act, which Congress passed in 2022 to ramp up the domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and increase funding for scientific research. The idea of spreading technology funding beyond Silicon Valley helped the legislation win broader support from lawmakers representing parts of the country that were eager to benefit.",

Voting happens in two rounds, and candidates who reached certain thresholds will move on to the next round on Sunday.\n\nA two-year streak of high inflation has left low- and middle-income French families grappling to pay for basics like energy, gas and food, while wages, in some cases, have failed to keep pace. Polls show that worries over \u201cpurchasing power\u201d were a top concern of voters, alongside immigration and security. Blue-collar workers turned out in droves to vote for the National Rally, which is promising to aid households and curb immigration.

Others have also expressed interest in acquiring National Amusements, including the media and finance executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Steven Paul, the Hollywood executive best known for his work on the \u201cBaby Geniuses\u201d franchise.\n\nA bid to take control of Paramount would be a coda of sorts for Mr. Diller, 82, who tried to acquire Paramount Pictures in the early \u201990s. He was outbid by Sumner Redstone, the bellicose media mogul whose daughter, Shari, now controls the company.\n\nMr. Diller was named head of Paramount Pictures in 1974 at the age of 32. He was credited with rejuvenating the studio, developing a cadre of talented lieutenants, like the future Disney chief executive Michael Eisner and the studio wunderkind Jeffrey Katzenberg, that became known as the Killer Dillers.\n\nAfter Mr. Redstone outbid him for the company, Mr. Diller set his sights on continuing to build his new media empire, striking a series of audacious deals to expand IAC.\n\n\u201cThey won,\u201d Mr. Diller said in a statement after losing out to Mr. Redstone. \u201cWe lost. Next.\u201d\n\nNational Amusements began exploring potential deals last year. As part of its talks with Skydance, Shari Redstone, the largest shareholder at National Amusements, would sell the company to Skydance, while Paramount would merge with Skydance through a separate transaction. That deal was scuttled after they could not agree on noneconomic terms after significant shareholder pushback.",

That program, which has about eight million enrollees, ties borrowers\u2019 monthly payment amounts to their income and household size.\n\nTwo judges, one in Kansas and another in Missouri, last Monday issued separate preliminary injunctions, which are tied to lawsuits that were filed in the spring by two groups of Republican-led states that seek to upend the SAVE program.\n\nThe Kansas order suspended parts of the program that were not yet in place, including a big decrease in monthly payments for people with undergraduate debt \u2014 to 5 percent of their discretionary income from 10 percent \u2014 which was to take effect on July 1.

Of most concern was the company\u2019s combination of data collected about users across its different platforms \u2014 including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 along with information pulled from other websites and apps.\n\nMeta argued that by offering a subscription, users had a fair alternative.\n\nBut regulators on Monday said the system was no choice at all, forcing users to pay for privacy.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here: 2 Brilliant Stocks Down 41% and 51% to Buy Right Now",
        "body": "The stock market has enjoyed an impressive rally so far in 2024. The S&P 500 index has risen 14.5%, and the even more technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has risen 18% across the stretch. Thanks to encouraging earnings results and excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and other trends, high-profile stocks including Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon have rocketed to new valuation highs.\n\nSome of the market's hottest stocks could continue to march even higher, but it would be a mistake to overlook opportunities in companies that still trade far below their previous valuation peaks. If you're on the hunt for investments that offer attractive valuations and strong long-term prospects, read on to see why two Fool.com contributors identified Altria Group (NYSE: MO) and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) as top stocks to buy right now.\n\nAltria is a strong defensive stock with a great dividend profile\n\nKeith Noonan: Altria stock has risen roughly 13% year to date, but the company's share price is still down roughly 41% from its peak. Even though the tobacco giant continues to lead the U.S. market with its Marlboro brand, it's facing some secular headwinds. Customers continue to move away from cigarettes, and this trend appears likely to continue.\n\nThe company's revenue and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted earnings each fell roughly 2.5% due to declining unit sales in the smokable tobacco category. Total cigarettes sold in the period declined roughly 10% year over year. On the other hand, management reaffirmed its guidance for annual adjusted earnings per share to increase between 2% and 4.5%.\n\nThanks to pricing increases and stock buybacks, Altria has actually managed to increase its earnings per share by roughly 26% over the last five years. While the company faces long-term headwinds due to declining unit volumes, the stock is still attractively valued.\n\nAltria trades at under 9 times this year's expected profits and pays a dividend yielding 8.6% based on the company's current share price. What's more, there's a very good chance that investors who buy the stock today won't have to wait long to enjoy an even bigger yield.\n\nLast August, Altria raised its dividend by roughly 4.3%. The payout hike marked the 58th dividend increase implemented by the company within the last 54 years.\n\nThe tobacco giant undoubtedly faces challenging trends in the cigarette market, but it's continuing to invest and build in smokeless product categories, and its dividend payout should remain safely covered for the foreseeable future. With a strong earnings base despite demand headwinds and a large, sustainable dividend, Altria is an appealing defensive stock that also offers compelling capital appreciation potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are getting excited about Disney again\n\nJennifer Saibil: Disney is still the company to beat in entertainment, with a robust slate of films, unparalleled global theme parks, an unmatched content library, and plenty of other gold-star assets. It took in $89 billion in trailing-12-month revenue over the last three years, putting it at No. 47 in the Fortune rankings of largest companies in the U.S. That's a 40% increase over the past three years. So why is its stock down 51% from its highs?\n\nMostly lots of volatility. Disney has made a stunning comeback from pandemic lows, but its different segments have been all over the place since then.\n\nParks were closed and sales were nonexistent, but that's changed now, and parks are back to strong momentum. Parks revenue increased 10% year over year in the 2024 fiscal second quarter (ended March 30). That's been the trend historically, and barring another global pandemic or other upheaval, it should continue.\n\nStreaming has skyrocketed over the past few years and now makes up more than half of the entertainment segment revenue, as well as a quarter of total company revenue. That comes from a mix of subscription and ad revenue. Streaming profitability without ESPN+ became profitable for the first time in the second quarter, and management is guiding for full profits by the end of the fiscal year. That should bring a big boost to the stock.\n\nThe other parts of Disney's content business, including linear networks and box office films, are still struggling. Viewers continue to cord-cut, or switch from cable TV to streaming, hurting cable revenue, and they're also moving away from traditional broadcast TV, hurting its ad business.\n\nHaving Bob Iger back in the hot seat as CEO has relieved shareholders and brought the company some stability. Investors have a lot of confidence in Iger, who led the company for 15 years through an incredible growth phase before walking away from the CEO role in 2020. He returned for what's meant to be an interim role as the company clarifies its direction, but his tenure has already been rendered through 2026. Disney has focused on generating profitability from Disney+, bringing magic back to the parks, and giving more freedom to the creatives that make the whole system work.\n\nDisney stock is climbing this year, up 13% as investors are cautiously building enthusiasm. Long term, it should get back to beating a market-beating winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Altria Group wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $751,670!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Unless you have approximately $13 million to give away over your lifetime, these taxes likely won\u2019t apply to you.\n\nA financial advisor can help you navigate and plan for gift and estate taxes. Find an advisor today.\n\nTo be very clear, these are the rules for federal taxation. Every state also has its own tax laws and every tax profile is different, so make sure to speak with a financial or tax professional before making any plans for your own assets. However, there are two main issues to consider within this scenario: the mortgage process and potential gift tax implications.\n\nDown Payments and Gifts\n\nA person signs a check.\n\nWith the mortgage and lender process, you want to ensure that you fill out all forms and requirements correctly. It is extremely unlikely that you can complicate the title to this property, but you can certainly complicate or invalidate the loan by making a mistake.\n\nWhen your daughter applies for her mortgage, the lender will go through her finances in detail. They want to know what assets she has, where they came from, what income she has and any other information related to how she will repay this debt. The down payment is intended as an indicator of this financial stability, so receiving it from a third party can raise concerns.\n\nMany lenders have rules around who can provide the money for a down payment. It\u2019s common for them to reject a mortgage with a gifted down payment unless that money comes from someone with a longstanding relationship to the borrower. Among other issues, this is intended to prevent fraud and money laundering. Since the borrower is your daughter, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\nIf you are giving the money directly to your daughter you will typically either need to \u201cseason\u201d the money or provide a gift letter. Seasoning the money means transferring it more than 60 days in advance, again as an indicator of legitimacy against fraudulent transfers. A gift letter is a document signed by both the giver and the recipient confirming that this is a unilateral transfer with no right to repayment.\n\nThe specific format of the gift letter will vary based on lender and jurisdiction, so consult an attorney about this document. A financial advisor can also potentially help you through this process.\n\nYou may also make this transfer through the loan process, making the down payment on your daughter\u2019s behalf rather than transferring the money to her. The lender will require you and your daughter to disclose this during the loan application process. In and of itself, your gift will typically not be a problem, but failing to specify the difference between borrower and payer will almost always complicate (if not invalidate) the loan.\n\nStory continues\n\nGift Tax Exclusions and Exemption Limits\n\nThe federal gift tax only applies to people who have gifted millions of dollars over the course of their lives.\n\nBeyond the rules that surround making a gift of this sort, your main consideration here is the gift tax.\n\nThis is a tax that the IRS places on unilateral transfers. If you give someone money or assets without expecting fair-value compensation in return, you have given them a gift. If you give them enough money, eventually you (the gift giver) must pay taxes on the transfer. Gift tax rates range from 18% to 40% based on the size of the gift.\n\nHowever, the gift tax only applies to very few households due to a pair of important tax provisions: an annual exclusion and a lifetime exemption limit. And if you have additional questions about either, consider speaking with a financial advisor.\n\nAnnual Exclusion\n\nThe first is the gift tax\u2019s annual exclusion. This is the amount of money you can give to someone each year regardless of gifts in past or future years. In 2023, the annual exclusion is set at $17,000 for individuals and $34,000 for married couples who file their taxes jointly. In 2024, those limits will increase to $18,000 for individuals and $36,000 for married couples.\n\nThe annual exclusion applies on a per-recipient basis. So, for example, say that you had four children. You could give each of them $17,000 in 2023 without triggering any gift taxes.\n\nLifetime Exemption\n\nThe lifetime gift and estate tax exemption is the amount of money you can give away over the course of your life \u2013 or at your death \u2013 without triggering either gift or estate taxes. For gifts that exceed the annual exclusion, the difference is applied to your lifetime exemption. If you give someone a gift over that year\u2019s annual exclusion and have exhausted your lifetime exemption, you\u2019ll owe gift taxes on the amount of money that exceeds that year\u2019s exclusion.\n\nIn 2023, the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption is $12.92 million for individuals, which means married couples have a combined exemption limit of $25.84 million. In 2024, the exemption will increase to $13.61 million for individuals and $27.22 million for married couples. If an individual has already gifted $12.92 million over the exclusion limits by 2023, they will be able to gift another $690,000 in 2024 (not including the annual exclusion amount).\n\nUnlike the annual exclusion, the lifetime exemption does not reset. While you can gift up to the annual exclusion each year, any remainder permanently reduces your lifetime cap. The lifetime exemption is on a per-donor basis, meaning that it applies collectively to all gifts you have given. For example, say that in 2023 you give $20,000 to each of your four children. Each gift exceeds the exclusion by $3,000. Collectively, they would lower your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption by $12,000.\n\nGift Taxes And Down Payments\n\nWhen it comes to your daughter\u2019s down payment, the tax issues are this: Are you married? And how much have you given away throughout your life? Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re single for simplicity\u2019s sake.\n\nFirst, if you give her the down payment money in 2023, the first $17,000 of the gift will automatically be free of any potential tax liability. However, since the gift exceeds the annual exclusion by $33,000, that remainder will lower your lifetime exemption.\n\nSo, for example, if you have never given anyone a taxable gift, you will pay no gift tax and your annual exclusion will be reduced to $12.887 million ($12.92 million minus $33,000). If you have already exhausted your lifetime exemption, you would have to pay taxes on the $33,000.\n\nHowever, there would still be ways to manage this potential tax liability. If you could wait until 2024 to give your daughter the money, your lifetime exemption would go up to $13.61 million. You can apply the remainder to the newly raised cap and will owe no taxes on the excess gift. But if you need additional help managing your tax liability, consider working with a financial advisor.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnless you have gifted more than $12.92 million over your lifetime, you can almost certainly give a $50,000 down payment to your daughter or other family member and not owe gift taxes in 2023. Just be careful to do the paperwork right, otherwise, it could complicate the loan.\n\nGift Tax Tips\n\nWill the fact that this is your daughter complicate things? While the IRS does not treat gifts from parents differently, large gifts within a wealthy family can potentially complicate future planning around trusts and estates.\n\nA financial advisor can help you strategically give away assets to lower your potential estate tax liability. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/gradyreese, \u00a9iStock.com/payphoto, \u00a9iStock.com/designer491\n\nThe post I Want to Give My Daughter and Her Husband $50,000 For a Down Payment.

        "title": "Apple's New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features Could Push This Semiconductor Company to a $1 Trillion Valuation",
        "body": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled its new artificial intelligence features dubbed \"Apple Intelligence\" at its Worldwide Developers Conference a few weeks ago. The highlights include text generation and summarization across apps, advanced AI-assisted photo editing capabilities, and a much smarter and more powerful Siri. It also integrates third-party services like ChatGPT for more advanced prompts.\n\nWhat makes Apple Intelligence so compelling is the amount of AI processing it does on the device. Instead of taking your query, sending it to a server along with any relevant data, waiting for the server to process your request, and then downloading the results to your device, the entire process happens on your iPhone, Mac, or iPad. For more advanced queries requiring a larger foundation model, Apple uses its own servers and system called Private Cloud Compute, which protects users' privacy.\n\nBoth of those developments could be a major win for one of Apple's biggest suppliers. Since all of these new features run on Apple-designed silicon, chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) could see an increase in orders due to Apple Intelligence. What's more, as Apple leads the way in on-device AI processing, it could push other device makers to buy more advanced chips from TSMC as well.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nPushing artificial intelligence to the edge\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Apple is ushering in the next phase of artificial intelligence known as edge AI (when data and algorithms are processed directly on the end device, in this case a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer).\n\nIn order to process AI queries on device, though, the devices need to be capable. That means hardware that's even just a few years old might not be able to handle AI requests as well as newer devices can, if they can even handle them at all. Apple, for example, is limiting Apple Intelligence features to the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the forthcoming iPhone 16 devices. (Note the limiting factor here is the amount of short-term memory, or RAM, on the device, not the processors themselves.)\n\nAs a result, Apple could see strong demand from users eager to upgrade their phones over the next few years as Apple Intelligence features roll out around the world. And more iPhone sales means more demand for TSMC's chips.\n\nBut TSMC doesn't just supply chips for Apple. It manufactures the majority of chips in the world, accounting for over 60% of the market. That scale gives it a massive competitive advantage over smaller foundries, as it can invest more money in R&D to develop more advanced processes to print more powerful and energy-efficient chips. That ensures it keeps existing customers like Apple that are looking for leading-edge chips, and it attracts more of their business. It also helps TSMC draw in new customers as innovations like edge AI push companies to adopt new chip designs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Apple cloud is just getting started\n\nIn order to support third-party large language models (LLMs) and its own more advanced LLM, Apple created Private Cloud Compute (PCC). The system uses Apple servers that also deploy the tech titan's own chip designs.\n\nIt's worth noting that Apple isn't using the platform to train AI models. It's using PCC to process data and algorithms that would require more compute power than what's available on consumer devices. The first implementation is sending prompts to ChatGPT.\n\nThere's a lot of potential for Apple to grow its data center capacity as it partners with more businesses and developers looking to integrate their AI services with Apple's platform. When the company announced its partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT, it said it's working to bring more partners to the platform later this year. If Apple pushes developers to use PCC, it could further increase Apple's demand for TSMC's services. It also offers another way for Apple to generate income from developers.\n\nThere's a long runway for Apple to grow AI features through third-party integrations. Just consider the phenomenal growth of the App Store over the past 15 years. Similar growth would be a boon for both Apple and TSMC.\n\nMaking a $1 trillion semiconductor company\n\nTSMC already has a market cap of around $900 billion. Even so, shares look undervalued at today's price given the growth potential spurred by continued demand for AI chips.\n\nThe stock trades for about 27x forward earnings estimates, which is a more than fair price to pay. It should be able to grow its earnings fast enough to justify that price as demand for more advanced chips supports its top-line growth and improves its operating margins. Analysts expect earnings will increase over 25% next year.\n\nA strong iPhone upgrade cycle over the next few years, incremental demand from Apple's new data centers, and the overall push toward edge computing all favor TSMC's continued growth. Its competitive advantage in creating the most advanced, powerful, and energy-efficient chips will serve it well over the next few years. It's only a matter of time before the company tops a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Completed Its 10-for-1 Stock Split in June. Here's How High the AI Stock Could Soar, According to Wall Street",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have quite literally carried the stock market higher. Since January 2023, the stock has advanced 740% due to enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 returned 44% during the same period. Put differently, Nvidia accounted for roughly one-fifth of the gains in the S&P 500 during the last 18 months.\n\nNvidia reset its surging share price with a 10-for-1 stock split in June, its second split in three years. Shares have since traded sideways, but Wall Street remains bullish. Nvidia carries an average price target of $136 per share, implying 11% upside from its current price of $122 per share.\n\nThe highest price target comes from Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt, who believes Nvidia will climb 64% to reach $200 per share by June 2025. The lowest price target comes from Gil Luria at D.A. Davidson, who believes Nvidia will decline 26% to reach $90 per share during the same period.\n\nRead on to learn more.\n\nNvidia has an important competitive advantage in its ecosystem of supporting software\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) excel at accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). The company consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks and objective tests for AI technologies, and it holds a greater than 80% market share in AI chips. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it has reinforced its dominance in AI chips with an ever-expanding ecosystem of supporting software.\n\nNvidia introduced the CUDA programming model in 2006, a software layer that allowed its GPUs (originally designed for computer graphics) to function as general purpose data center processors. \"Millions of lines of code have been written over the years for CUDA that have made developing new AI applications easier when using Nvidia's chips,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMore recently, Nvidia introduced AI Enterprise, a suite of pretrained models and software tools that streamline the development and deployment of AI applications across a broad number of use cases. For instance, the AI Enterprise suite includes frameworks for recommender systems, logistics route optimization, conversational assistants, cybersecurity threat detection, and autonomous robots.\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann sees that as an important competitive advantage. \"The real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness,\" Mosesmann recently told clients. \"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the flip side, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria is concerned that Nvidia derives most of its revenue from Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla. Those four companies are developing their own AI chips to displace Nvidia GPUs. Luria thinks that competition will be problematic, stating, \"Looking beyond the next four to six quarters, we believe a decline in demand for Nvidia compute is inevitable.\"\n\nBoth analysts make valid points, but the argument made by Mosesmann seems to trump the concerns raised by Luria. Competitors are indeed building custom AI chips, but history suggests they will need a comparable software ecosystem to truly displace Nvidia. For instance, Alphabet has been using custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for nearly a decade. But Nvidia GPUs remain the gold standard.\n\nIndeed, Toshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs is not concerned about the competition. \"We believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans hardware and software capabilities,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"Nvidia's annual introduction of new products and platforms sets a pace of innovation that keeps it at the forefront of the industry.\"\n\nWall Street has lofty expectations concerning Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth\n\nNvidia reported exceptional financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28, 2024). Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income surged 462% to $15.2 billion. CEO Jensen Huang said growth was \"fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference\" solutions.\n\nWhat makes Nvidia's first-quarter performance particularly impressive is that it comes on top of triple-digit growth in the three preceding quarters, as shown in the chart below.\n\nNvidia's revenue and non-GAAP net income have increased at a triple-digit pace for four consecutive quarters.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts have high expectations for Nvidia. The chart below shows the consensus revenue and non-GAAP net income estimates over the next five quarters.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow revenue and non-GAAP net income quickly over the next five quarters.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a tolerable valuation compared to Wall Street's earnings estimates\n\nI mentioned earlier that Nvidia shares have gained 740% since the beginning of January 2023. After that price appreciation, investors may assume Nvidia sports an exorbitant valuation. But the stock currently trades at 72 times earnings, a discount to the three-year average of 87 times earnings and the five-year average of 80 times earnings.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share by 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes the current valuation look tolerable. Investors should not kid themselves into thinking the stock is cheap. But Nvidia remains one of the best ways for patient investors to expose their portfolios to AI, a market forecast to grow by 36% annually through 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "U.S. Money Supply Is Finally Growing Again, and It Could Signal a Big Change Is Coming in the Stock Market",
        "body": "The S&P 500 is setting one new all-time high after another in 2024. The widely used stock market benchmark climbed 15% in the first half of 2024, and it's up more than 50% from the lows of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe largest companies have led the current market rally in the S&P 500. In fact, market concentration is reaching levels investors haven't seen since the 1970s.\n\nThe rising market concentration is a result of various factors. It's worth pointing out that many of the largest companies have seen solid earnings growth as they've been well positioned amid the artificial intelligence boom. But rising concentration has historically reversed, and one market indicator suggests the tides may be about to turn.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nU.S. money supply is finally growing again\n\nDeclining growth in money supply is historically tied to increased concentration among stocks, according to Khuram Chaudhry, Head of European Quantitative Strategy at J.P. Morgan. When money is easily accessible for cheap, smaller companies can grow more easily. When money supply is tight, bigger companies have the advantage of using existing cash flows and their balance sheet to fund their growth.\n\nStarting in 2021, we saw a decline in a measure of the U.S. money supply called the M2 money supply. M2 includes cash in circulation, deposit accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. It's basically all the easily accessible money in the country. By 2022, amid tightening policies from the Federal Reserve, year-over-year growth in the M2 money supply was negative. It stayed that way through the first quarter of this year.\n\nBut M2 money supply is finally growing again. In April and May, M2 money supply increased about 0.6% year over year. While it remains well below its peak levels from 2022, we're finally seeing increased liquidity.\n\nThe money supply could get a further boost later this year, as the Fed looks to ease its constraints. Chairman Jerome Powell said he expects to cut interest rates one time this year, but many analysts think that's conservative. Futures markets indicate that the majority of traders currently expect at least two interest rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nAs money supply growth accelerates, it could make it easier for smaller companies to grow. As a result, those smaller companies could lead the next leg in the current market rally.\n\nHow to invest as money supply growth accelerates\n\nIf you expect easing fiscal policies will reverse the steep run up in market concentration, there are a few ways you could invest.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most straightforward way to invest in declining market concentration is to use an equal-weight index fund like the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT: RSP).\n\nThe S&P 500 is a cap-weighted index, which means the largest companies have a bigger influence over how the index moves than smaller companies do. With the current level of market concentration, the top three companies account for over 20% of the entire index's value. The top 10 account for over 37%. If you invest in a standard S&P 500 index fund, your portfolio is highly dependent on just a handful of companies.\n\nWith an equal weight S&P 500 index fund, the fund invests all your money equally across every component of the S&P 500. The portfolio gets rebalanced once per quarter and adjusted for new companies joining the S&P 500 and old companies leaving. Historically, the equal weight index outperforms the cap-weighted index, as smaller companies generally grow faster than the largest companies. That hasn't been the case recently, though.\n\nAnother option is to invest outside of the S&P 500. There are thousands of investable stocks trading on public exchanges. The S&P 500 only tracks about 500 of the largest companies. Declining market concentration would favor small- and mid-cap stocks as well. Buying shares of a Russell 2000 index fund like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEMKT: IWM) is a great way to get exposure to small-caps. The Vanguard Extended Market ETF (NYSEMKT: VXF) provides a way to match the performance of nearly every stock in the market except those in the S&P 500.\n\nWhile no indicator is right all the time, money supply growth isn't the only factor that suggests now may be a great time to start investing in smaller companies. So, you may want to tilt your portfolio toward investments like those above as more and more signs point toward a big change in the stock market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust - Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust - Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust - Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have exploded in popularity following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Their consistently rising prices have led industry leaders like Nvidia to enact stock splits, looking to make their shares more liquid and available to regular investors.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only way to bet on this exciting new opportunity. Let's explore why Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another soaring AI stock split that belongs on your investment radar.\n\nIs Broadcom the next Nvidia?\n\nFormed by the 2015 merger between Broadcom Corporation and Avago Technologies, Broadcom is a diversified semiconductor company that designs and manufactures an array of information technology hardware.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, Broadcom isn't a big player in the market for high-end, general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train and run generative AI algorithms. Instead, it gains exposure to the industry through custom chips tailored to each client's specific use case.\n\nFor data centers, opting for a Broadcom-designed custom chip probably has more up-front costs and commitments than buying off-the-shelf solutions like Nvidia's H100. But the trade-off comes with cost and power advantages, which can pay off over the long term.\n\nBroadcom boasts big-name clients like Alphabet (which contracts with Broadcom to design its Google TPU chips) and Chinese social media giant Bytedance, which reportedly aims to use Broadcom services to help ensure a supply of powerful processors amid rising tensions with the U.S. government. Opting for Broadcom's custom chips can help the Chinese company fit within tightening export controls that effectively block many of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs.\n\nNon-AI-related growth drivers\n\nIt's never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket \u2014 especially if that basket is a hyped-up tech megatrend. While AI technology might transform the global economy, we don't know when that will happen, or if the current demand for AI chips is sustainable. Previous hype cycles like the internet ended badly for companies that overexposed themselves too early.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe good news is that Broadcom's business is diversified. The company provides semiconductor services for industries ranging from smartphones to enterprise networking. And while these are mainly mature businesses, they help stabilize Broadcom's operations.\n\nBut the company also has an exciting non-AI-related growth driver, VMware. Completed in 2023, the $69 billion deal was one of the biggest in tech history. It gave Broadcom more exposure to the infrastructure software business and helped send overall company revenue up 43% year over year to $12.49 billion in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy?\n\nDespite shares jumping almost 470% over the last five years, many smaller investors are finally taking notice of Broadcom after management announced a 10-for-1 stock split that could bring its quadruple-digit stock price back down to earth when it goes live on July 15. Remember that this move doesn't change the company's market cap (the value of all shares outstanding) or its valuation relative to earnings.\n\nThe good news is that with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of just 28, Broadcom's valuation is in line with the Nasdaq average of 31 and cheap compared to AI-related alternatives like Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices, which boast forward P/Es of 36 and 54, respectively. This means the company remains a safer way to bet on the long-term AI opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

In the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), those chips sent the company's data center revenue skyrocketing 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion.\n\nNvidia is now spreading some of that wealth by investing in smaller AI companies, a strategy that supports the industry's growth and could lead to a nice return for its own shareholders if the bets pay off.\n\nNvidia headquarters. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nThe four stocks Nvidia owns\n\nAccording to Nvidia's latest form 13F, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, the chipmaker holds a stake in the following AI companies:\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which built the architecture most semiconductor companies use to design their chips.\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops voice recognition and conversational AI software.\n\nNano-X Imaging , which uses AI to produce better results from medical imaging.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, which uses AI to aid in drug discovery.\n\nIt invested in each company at the end of 2023. Arm Holdings received the largest investment at around $147 million, which is more than Nvidia deployed into the other three stocks combined. Today, that Arm position is worth $311 million thanks to a 130% gain in the stock in 2024 already.\n\nNvidia invested around $3.7 million in SoundHound AI, and its stock has climbed 87% year to date, which now places that value at $6.7 million.\n\nArm and SoundHound are the standout performers, and here's why that could continue.\n\nArm Holdings\n\nNvidia tried to buy Arm for $40 billion in 2020, but it was forced to abandon the deal because regulators said it was anticompetitive. It's no surprise, because Arm built the architecture that many leading semiconductor makers use to design their chips -- including Nvidia and one of its closest competitors, Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nArm specializes in central processing units (CPUs), which are used in personal computers (PCs), smartphones, and even some of the GPUs designed by Nvidia to increase efficiency. Its upcoming GB200, for example, is configured with a combination of two GPUs and two Arm-based CPUs, and it's capable of inferencing AI models at five times the speed of its flagship H100, which currently dominates the data center market. This will drive costs down for developers, who often pay for computing capacity on a by-the-minute basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn estimated 99% of smartphone CPUs also use Arm's architecture, so the company is overwhelmingly dominant in that segment. Plus, Microsoft is integrating AI into the Windows operating system, which is triggering a new wave of demand for next-generation chips from computer manufacturers. Arm CEO Rene Haas believes his company can capture a 50% share of the Windows PC market within five years.\n\nThe company likely has a bright future, but investors should be wary of its lofty valuation before they rush to buy the stock. It generated $3.2 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), and based on its market capitalization of $169.8 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 53.\n\nThat makes it even more expensive than Nvidia stock, with its P/S ratio of 38.7. Keep in mind, Nvidia is expected to nearly double its revenue in its current fiscal 2025, whereas Arm is projected to grow its revenue by just 23%. It doesn't make much sense to pay a higher valuation for Arm relative to Nvidia, when Arm is growing at a much slower pace.\n\nNvidia bought Arm stock at a much cheaper price than where it trades today, so it might be best for investors to wait for a pullback before joining the party.\n\nSoundHound AI\n\nSoundHound AI developed a suite of conversational AI software tools that have been deployed by businesses in the hospitality, restaurant, and automotive industries. They can hold entire spoken conversations with a user, making them extremely useful in high-pressure settings where fast answers are required to serve customers.\n\nThe restaurant industry is using SoundHound's new Employee Assist tool to give workers a helpful virtual assistant they can call upon at any time. It understands store policies, and it can even offer employees guidance when making menu items. The technology is also used to take customer orders in a drive-thru lane, over the phone, and in a store.\n\nWhite Castle, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Krispy Kreme are just some of the chains using it. With help from its acquisition of restaurant AI company SYNQ3, SoundHound is now in 10,000 locations with 100,000 more in the pipeline, and management says its addressable market includes 1 million restaurants and 30 million other businesses across North America. So the company has barely scratched the surface of an opportunity that could be worth $100 billion.\n\nSoundHound's in-car voice assistant is used by leading automotive brands like Honda, Hyundai, and Stellantis (which owns Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler). And the company recently partnered with Nvidia's Drive platform to refine the voice assistant by delivering it on the edge, which means users won't need network connectivity to access it. That improves privacy and enables it to work even in geographic areas with no network service.\n\nSoundHound generated $11.6 million in revenue during the recent fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended March 31), representing 73% growth from the year-ago period. Its order backlog also soared 80% to a record $682 million, so there is plenty of demand in the pipeline. Considering its stock trades at a P/S of 19.5, it looks like a much better value than Arm.\n\nHowever, SoundHound lost $33 million during the first quarter. Given that it has only $117 million in cash on hand, the company will probably have to raise money by selling equity, which will dilute existing shareholders. Therefore, this stock should be reserved for investors with a high risk tolerance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street May Be Underestimating This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: 2 Reasons Why You Should Consider Buying While It Remains Beaten-Down",
        "body": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) hasn't received much love on Wall Street of late, which is evident from the 23% decline in the company's stock price since it posted a 52-week high in early March.\n\nThe stock has been punished on account of weaker-than-expected growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) business in the first quarter of 2024, as a result of which the company missed the market's growth expectations. Additionally, the stock was recently downgraded by Morgan Stanley to neutral from overweight, with the investment bank pointing out that investors' expectations of growth from its AI business are on the higher side.\n\nThe bank added that it sees limited upside in shares of AMD despite a recovery in the company's key business segments. However, it may be too early to write off this semiconductor stock for a few simple reasons. Let's take a closer look at two of them.\n\n1. AMD is in a terrific position to capitalize on the growing sales of AI-enabled computers\n\nAccording to Mercury Research, AMD's market share in desktop central processing units (CPUs) stood at 23.9% in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 4.7 percentage points from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, its share of notebook CPUs increased by 3.1 percentage points to 19.3%. Intel controls the rest of this market, but it is worth noting that AMD has been rapidly making a dent in Intel's market share.\n\nThe good part is that AMD has set its sights on the AI PC market via its new generation of Ryzen processors equipped with dedicated hardware to enable AI applications. Its new Ryzen AI 300 processors deliver 3 times the performance of the previous generation offering on laptops. More importantly, AMD estimates that its processors could power more than 150 AI software experiences by the end of 2024, as a result of which its CPUs could keep gaining market share.\n\nSo, there is a good chance that AMD will be able to sustain the impressive growth momentum that it is witnessing in the client processor business right now. The company's revenue from selling CPUs deployed in laptops and desktops increased 85% year over year in the first quarter to $1.4 billion.\n\nAMD is the smaller player in the client CPU market. So, if it continues to take market share away from Intel and makes the most of the opportunity in AI-enabled PCs, shipments of which are forecast to increase at an annual rate of 44% over the next four years, its client revenue could continue improving at a healthy rate.\n\n2. The data center business has a couple of solid catalysts\n\nAMD's data center business is benefiting from the proliferation of AI in a couple of ways.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, the company's data center graphics processing unit (GPU) business is now gaining traction thanks to the massive demand for AI accelerators. This year, AMD is forecasting $4 billion in revenue from sales of data center GPUs. The company has been raising its revenue expectations from sales of data center GPUs over the past few quarters as more customers have been lining up to buy its chips.\n\nGiven that AMD generated a total of $6.5 billion in revenue from its data center segment last year, it is easy to see that this segment is on track to deliver robust growth in 2024. It is also worth noting that AMD sold $400 million worth of data center GPUs in the fourth quarter of 2023, which means that it is on track to clock a much faster quarterly revenue run rate in this business this year.\n\nAMD's data center GPU revenue could keep growing at a nice pace over the long run because of the massive revenue opportunity available in the AI chip market, as well as the company's moves to make a bigger dent in this space by accelerating its product development.\n\nHowever, there is another AI-related opportunity for AMD in the data center market thanks to AI in the form of server processors. The company's Epyc server CPUs are being deployed for AI inference applications, and they are driving solid growth in data center revenue along with GPUs. More specifically, AMD's overall data center revenue increased 80% year over year in Q1 to $2.3 billion.\n\nConsidering that AMD has been gaining market share in server processors, investors can expect this terrific growth to continue in the future. AMD's server CPU unit market share increased 5.6 percentage points year over year to 23.6%, while its revenue share increased to 33%. This, again, is happening at Intel's expense and bodes well for AMD as the global server market is expected to grow at more than 12% a year for the next five years.\n\nThese catalysts explain why AMD's growth is forecast to improve.\n\nAMD EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSo, investors would do well to take advantage of the pullback in AMD as the stock market could reward its stronger growth with more upside in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Utility Stocks With Attractive Yields to Buy Hand Over Fist in July",
        "body": "The utility sector has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 index over the past year, trailing the broader market by over 15 percentage points. Higher interest rates are a big part of the story since utilities generally make heavy use of debt to fund their businesses. But the sector is home to a lot of reliable dividend stocks.\n\nYou might want to take a closer look at NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC), and Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) in July while Wall Street is still in a dour mood and yields in the sector are still lofty.\n\nNextEra Energy is a dividend growth machine\n\nNextEra Energy has increased its dividend annually for three decades and counting. That's a pretty compelling streak, but it isn't the best out there. In fact, there are a handful of utilities that have achieved Dividend King status. Where NextEra Energy stands out is dividend growth, with the trailing annualized dividend increase over the past decade at a huge 10% or so. That figure is 10% over the trailing three- and five-year periods, too. And management is projecting 10% dividend growth through at least 2026, so the streak of huge dividend growth isn't over yet.\n\nXLU Chart\n\n10% dividend growth is good for any company, and it's really good for a utility. How does NextEra achieve this? It has a slow and steadily growing regulated utility business on top of which it has built one of the largest renewable power businesses in the world. The latter business is the growth engine, and given the global shift toward cleaner energy sources, the runway for growth seems likely to be long.\n\nThe problem with NextEra Energy is that investors know just how well run the company is and have priced it accordingly. The yield is below average for a utility at 2.9%. But if you are a dividend growth investor, this is probably the utility stock you'll want to own.\n\nBrookfield Renewable is laser-focused on clean power\n\nIf you like the notion of investing in clean energy but are looking for more yield than NextEra Energy has to offer, you should consider Brookfield Renewable. This isn't technically a utility, but it owns clean energy assets around the world and deserves your attention given its huge 5% or 5.7% yield. Why are there two yields? Because there are two share options, one structured as a partnership and one as a traditional corporation.\n\nBoth Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Renewable Corporation represent the same entity. The only difference is in the demand among investors for each share type. The partnership is a bit more complicated in that it comes with a K-1 form that has to be dealt with come tax time. But it is not a master limited partnership, so it can still be owned in a tax-advantaged retirement account.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you are trying to maximize your passive income stream, Brookfield Renewable Partners is a strong option. If you don't want to bother with the K-1, a 5% yield is still pretty attractive. Either way, you still get a globally diversified portfolio of clean energy assets.\n\nBut, more importantly, you get to invest alongside Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM), which oversees Brookfield Renewable. Brookfield Asset Management has decades of experience and is a well-respected infrastructure investor. You could do much worse than partnering with this company by adding high-yield Brookfield Renewable to your portfolio.\n\nDominion Energy is on the mend\n\nThe last option on this list is a turnaround story in the form of Dominion Energy. As just a simple regulated utility, it has gone through a major business overhaul over the past decade or so. The most recent review has resulted in large non-core assets being sold (including three regulated natural gas utilities) so that the company can pay down debt, lower its payout ratio, and focus on its reasonably well-positioned regulated electricity operations.\n\nThe dividend yield is currently around 5.4% today, but the dividend isn't going to grow until the payout ratio is in line with the industry average, which will probably take a few years. However, given the yield, investors are being paid well to wait. After that point, the dividend should grow in line with earnings, which the company believes can expand between 5% and 7% a year. Notably, Dominion operates in one of the fastest-growing data center markets in the world, which should help to spur demand for power in its region.\n\nThere's still time, but don't wait too long\n\nUtility stocks are largely out of favor today as Wall Street worries about the long-term effect of higher interest rates. While interest rates are a headwind, the sector will adjust to the change over time, just like it has during past rate change cycles. If you can stomach stepping in when others are fearful, buying now while the news is bad could lead to strong returns over the long term. And three good places to start in the utility space are NextEra Energy, Brookfield Renewable, and Dominion Energy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Brookfield Renewable right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Brookfield Renewable, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Brookfield Renewable wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Linda (not pictured) is still planning on working after retirement. Image_Source_/Getty Images\n\nLinda, a retired Ohio teacher, must continue working to stay afloat.\n\nShe and her husband, both public servants, lived modestly, but she still needs to work.\n\nMany retirees face similar struggles with low incomes, dwindling pensions, and Social Security withering.\n\nLinda, 64, has worked for the last 31 years, but that doesn't mean she's done.\n\nThe retired high school teacher in Ohio, whose last name is known to BI, said her retirement isn't looking how she anticipated. Both she and her late husband were public servants, which means they didn't have high-paid careers, but she does have a pension \u2014 meaning she'll get a monthly payout in retirement. But it's not getting her as far as she'd hoped.\n\n\"We lived the modest life of two public employees just making ends meet,\" Linda said. \"We bought a house, we struggled in debt. I'm still in debt after his death and the bills keep coming and I need to keep working.\"\n\nBefore her retirement, she was earning around $5,000 a month. Now, with her pension, she'll have around $3,700 a month coming in.\n\nShe's looking into part-time work and other opportunities that could keep her afloat. She wants something that will give her a \"modicum of autonomy\" when it comes to scheduling and said that if necessary, she'll apply for Instacart and deliver groceries. She wants to ensure she's never burdensome to her children, even in her older age.\n\nShe doesn't ever see herself being able to stop working completely; she said she would work until she could no longer physically do so.\n\nLinda isn't alone. Many retirees or would-be-retirees aren't able to fully throw in the towel. Just over half are living on less than $30,000 a year, or expecting to work until the day they're not physically able to anymore. It's a situation that's become more pronounced in the last few years, as retirement becomes increasingly reserved for higher earners \u2014 and it might only get worse as pensions continue to wither and Social Security remains imperiled.\n\n\"I fully see myself working for the next 20-some years \u2014 if I have that many left. Whatever years I have left, I will not be enjoying the retirement life in Florida,\" Linda said.\n\nA looming retirement crisis for many\n\nLinda's retirement goals are modest: She's hoping to concoct a winning recipe where she can survive on her teacher's pension, a rolled-over government-worker retirement plan, the sale of her house, and some part-time work.\n\n\"I'm hoping that all of those ingredients piled together in a bowl will bake something that I am able to live with. I will never be wealthy. I will never be without care and without worry, but I would like to at some point get to the point where I am free to travel and supplement my income with part-time employment,\" she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nLinda is one of the dwindling number of retirees who have a pension, but that comes after a career spent in low-paying public service. A Government Accountability Office report has found that older lower-income Americans have become increasingly less likely to have any retirement account balances; simultaneously, fewer low-income households have a pension. That means that the onus of retirement saving and planning have shifted onto workers, rather than employers who pay into a monthly pension benefit; for lower-income workers, who might not be able to spare savings, that can be an even more acute challenge.\n\nLinda said she thinks teachers especially have gotten a bad rap over the last few decades. They are seen as people who just want to siphon off of the system, but she said that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\n\"Even though I had that position, I also had the low salary that went with it. And there are many things that you have to deal with in life financially,\" she said. \"And teaching, unfortunately, is not a career choice that guarantees financial stability.\"\n\nEven so, she said it was still the most uplifting and rewarding work she's ever done.\n\nShe'd also like the country to rethink conversations around Social Security and retirement benefits more broadly. Pensions have gotten in the hands of private equity, she said, potentially imperiling those guaranteed benefits. At the same time, politicians have taken aim at Social Security, suggesting potentially pushing up the retirement age and not moving to fund its coffers.\n\n\"We have to get out of this frame of mind that suggests that Social Security that people have paid into for decades is somehow an entitlement. It is a right,\" she said.\n\nBut, even so, Linda still feels fortunate: She has two adult sons who will always look out for her; she's even moving to be closer to one. They make good money, and she knows she has a safety net.\n\n\"There are so many in this country who are looking at retirement age and throwing up their hands and in total desperation, wondering how they're going to make it,\" she said. \"And those are the people I really feel terrible for.\"\n\nAre you struggling to retire or not experiencing the retirement you hoped for?

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Altria Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "body": "Tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE: MO) is one of the best-performing stocks of all time, but slowing growth has reduced it to a high-yield income specialist that has badly lagged the broader market for the past decade.\n\nThe good news is that recent developments are painting a brighter future for Altria. The company's growing potential in smokeless products offers investors hope, while its familiar dividend creates a lucrative one-two punch that could make Altria a respectable market performer again.\n\nThere are three key reasons to consider buying the stock today.\n\n1. Eating market share in next-generation products\n\nThe nicotine industry has settled on several non-burning products as the eventual replacement for smoking: electronic cigarettes, heated tobacco devices, and oral nicotine pouches. Altria has dominated the U.S. market with Marlboro and its other brands for decades. However, it's vulnerable as it battles competitors for market share in next-generation categories.\n\nIt hasn't been easy, but Altria is starting to gain ground in several areas. It's competing in oral nicotine pouches with its former sister company, Philip Morris International, which owns the market leader, Zyn. Altria's On! brand increased its market share to 7.1% of the oral tobacco category in the first quarter, up from 6.4% a year ago. Q1 On! volumes were up 32.1% year over year.\n\nLast June, Altria acquired the pod-based electronic cigarette product NJOY. Since then, it has ramped up its distribution to over 82,000 stores in just a year, a 132% increase. That has helped the brand grow its market share from 5.1% to 11.5% since the acquisition. Altria also recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) market authorization for several NJOY menthol variations. It's the first company to receive menthol approval.\n\nTo be clear, Altria still depends on smokeable products, which needs to change eventually. However, these market share gains show Altria is successfully executing its strategy with next-generation products. Now, it just needs time to build them into a more meaningful piece of the business.\n\n2. Slow Iqos launch could buy Altria's core business time\n\nAltria's biggest threat might be Philip Morris' plans to launch its leading heated tobacco brand, Iqos, in the United States. The two tobacco companies just ended an agreement under which Altria had exclusive rights to market Iqos in the U.S. market, freeing Philip Morris to pursue its own plans. Launched overseas in 2014, Iqos has proven capable of switching smokers away from cigarettes in international markets. Iqos' success would potentially accelerate Altria's cigarette declines.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Iqos doesn't appear as immediate a threat as it once did. Philip Morris is waiting for FDA authorization of its newest model, Iluma, for a broad rollout. The application was submitted to the FDA in October. It's tough to say how long approval might take; the original device's application took two years to gain approval. Philip Morris had planned a Q2 test launch in four cities (starting in Texas) using its older, approved model, but there hasn't been an indication yet that it's happened.\n\nMeanwhile, Philip Morris is grappling with keeping up with surging Zyn demand that has caused supply shortages in retail and attracted political attention. Iqos isn't going away, but it looks like it's on the back burner for the time being. Any delay benefits Altria's core business. Besides, it's unknown when and to what degree Iqos will impact its cigarette sales. Investors probably shouldn't panic until there is reason to.\n\n3. The dividend remains a launch pad for investment returns\n\nThe magic of Altria stock is that it doesn't need much growth to provide solid investment returns. The company's famous dividend yields 8.6% today, almost what the broader market returns in an average year. The stock once traded at an unsustainable valuation, and that painful unwinding was the biggest culprit behind Altria's poor past performance. The P/E ratio has fallen from 25 in 2016 to under 9.\n\nCould the stock go lower? Of course! Still, Altria's current valuation makes far more sense for the company's growth prospects, which makes a repeat of the past five years less likely.\n\nMO PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAssuming Altria's P/E ratio stays the same, earnings growth should translate to investment returns. Analysts believe earnings will grow by an average of 3% to 4% annually over the next three to five years. Add that 8.6% yield, and investors could enjoy 11% and 12% annual returns.\n\nThat's far better than what shareholders have endured for most of the past decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Altria Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Can I Switch My Social Security Benefit to a Spousal Benefit for More Money?",
        "body": "can i switch from my social security benefit to a spousal benefit\n\nSocial Security benefits can provide you with a stream of retirement income that is reliable. Deciding when to take benefits is an important question, especially if you\u2019re married and hope to qualify for spousal benefits. If you\u2019re already taking Social Security, you might be wondering if it\u2019s possible to switch to a spousal benefit later. The answer depends on whether your spouse is receiving Social Security benefits yet.\n\nA financial advisor can help you figure out what you qualify for and when the best time is for you to start taking benefits as part of your full retirement plan.\n\nHow Do Social Security Spousal Benefits Work?\n\nCalculating Social Security benefits as a married couple is a bit different than doing it as a single person. When someone files for Social Security benefits, their spouse may be able to claim a spousal benefit. The benefit is based on their spouse\u2019s contributions to Social Security and is capped at 50% of their benefit amount at full retirement age. For example, if they were to receive $2,200 per month at full retirement age, their spousal benefit would max out at $1,100 per month.\n\nIn order to receive spousal Social Security benefits, you must:\n\nBe at least 62, the earliest age at which you can receive Social Security benefits OR\n\nBe a caretaker for a child under age 16 or a child who\u2019s receiving Social Security disability benefits\n\nBe married for at least one year to someone who has filed for their retirement benefits\n\nWhen you apply for spousal benefits, the Social Security Administration calculates your benefits based on your own work and earnings record as well. If you\u2019re eligible to receive your retirement benefit as well as spousal benefits, then you\u2019d get the higher of the two.\n\nIf your spouse hasn\u2019t filed for retirement yet, then you can\u2019t get spousal benefits. You can, however, file for your own retirement benefits if you\u2019re at least 62 years old.\n\nTaking Social Security at age 62 will reduce your benefit amount, below the amount you\u2019d be entitled to if you had waited until you reached full retirement age. Delaying benefits until age 70, on the other hand, increases your benefit amount.\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming spousal benefits and filing before your full retirement age, then your benefit amount would be roughly 30% instead of 50%. The only exception is if you\u2019re claiming spousal benefits and you\u2019re a caretaker for a child under 16 or a child with disabilities.\n\nCan I Switch My Social Security Benefit to a Spousal Benefit?\n\nSwitching from your regular retirement benefit to a spousal benefit is something you might be interested in if you\u2019re hoping to maximize Social Security benefits. Whether you can make this switch is determined by whether your spouse is already receiving benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf your spouse is not receiving any retirement benefits yet, then you could technically take your regular Social Security benefit as early as age 62. When your spouse files for their benefit later you could switch to spousal benefits. That could potentially increase the total amount of benefits you receive as a couple if they\u2019re waiting until age 70 to start taking benefits.\n\nWhat if your spouse is already receiving their Social Security benefits? In that situation, the deemed filing rule applies. That rule dictates that when someone applies for their regular retirement benefit, they\u2019re also approved for spousal benefits if they\u2019re entitled to receive them. So again, you\u2019d get the higher amount of the two.\n\nConsider speaking with a financial advisor who can help you navigate your Social Security benefits and build a robust retirement plan.\n\nDeemed Filing and Spousal Benefits\n\ncan i switch from my social security benefit to a spousal benefit\n\nThe Social Security Administration implemented the deemed filing rule to prevent double-dipping. Prior to the rule, if spousal benefits were higher than an individual benefit, the person could receive a combination of benefits equal to the higher benefit. Deemed filing keeps spouses from receiving one type of retirement benefit while also benefiting from delaying another type of benefit.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this rule, which would still allow you to apply for spousal benefits independent of your own retirement benefit. You might be eligible for an exception if you:\n\nWere born before January 2, 1954\n\nAre caring for a child under 16 or a child with disabilities\n\nAre eligible for Social Security disability benefits\n\nIf you\u2019ve already taken your retirement benefits and your spouse is receiving a spousal benefit, they can opt to switch over to their retirement benefit instead if they were born before January 2, 1954. In that situation, you could then apply for an additional spousal benefit on top of your regular benefit once their benefits kick in.\n\nWhen Should You Claim Spousal Benefits?\n\nTiming matters when deciding when to claim spousal benefits. Again, taking benefits before full retirement age can reduce the number of benefits that you\u2019re eligible to receive. However, delaying spousal benefits beyond full retirement age won\u2019t increase the benefit amount, the way that it would regular retirement benefits.\n\nWhen deciding how to time spousal benefits or retirement benefits, it helps to look at the bigger picture and consider:\n\nLife expectancies and how long you and your spouse anticipate relying on Social Security benefits\n\nHealth and the possibility of one or both of you needing long-term care at some point\n\nOther income sources, including investments, a 401(k) or IRA or money earned from part-time work or side jobs\n\nRetirement budget and estimated expenses\n\nLiving longer, for example, might make delaying Social Security benefits more attractive. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t have sufficient savings and investments then you might need the additional income that Social Security can provide sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you\u2019re confused about when to take spousal benefits or whether you can switch your retirement benefit to spousal benefits, talking to a financial advisor can help. An advisor who\u2019s well-versed in Social Security planning can help you to decide on the right time to claim those benefits.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\ncan i switch from my social security benefit to a spousal benefit\n\nIt\u2019s possible to switch your Social Security retirement benefit to spousal benefits if your spouse hasn\u2019t filed yet. Whether it makes sense to do so can depend on your current ages and the ages at which each of you filed for benefits.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the longer you can delay filing for Social Security the better, as it can result in a larger benefit amount.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nConsider talking to your financial advisor about switching from your retirement benefit to spousal benefits if your spouse has plans to claim their own benefits. If you don\u2019t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. With SmartAsset\u2019s free tool, matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nTalking to your advisor can also help you to come up with a strategy for coordinating Social Security alongside other sources of income, such as a pension plan, annuity, 401(k) or government retirement benefits. Deciding when to tap into each income stream can affect your tax situation so it\u2019s important to understand the best order for drawing down assets. An advisor can also offer advice on how to claim Social Security benefits as an ex-spouse if you\u2019re now divorced.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\n\u00a9iStock.com/dragana991, \u00a9iStock.com/RainStar, \u00a9iStock.com/Jelena Stanojkovic\n\nThe post Rules for Switching Social Security Benefits appeared first on SmartAsset Blog.",

        "title": "Forget Chevron? Buffett Is Buying Up This Energy Stock Instead",
        "body": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has a massive portfolio of stocks, but two companies on the list that have made headlines lately are Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). In the conglomerate's latest 13F filing on May 15, Buffett revealed that in the first quarter, he sold around 3.1 million shares of Chevron shares and added about 4.3 million shares to his Oxy position.\n\nShould you follow Buffett's lead?\n\nBuffett still owns a lot of Chevron\n\nBuffett didn't exit his position in Chevron (at the time of the filing he still owned more than $19 billion worth of Chevron's shares), so it isn't exactly like he dumped the stock so he could buy Oxy. But he did sell a material amount of Chevron and notably up his stake in Oxy (which was worth about $16 billion at the time of the filling). So it looks like he used the cash raised from the Chevron sale to fund the purchase of additional shares of Oxy. That said, investors in Chevron shouldn't dump it from their portfolios based on this shift.\n\nImage source: Motley Fool.\n\nIn fact, particularly if you are a conservative income investor, you'll probably want to keep Chevron around. It has a rock-solid balance sheet and a broadly diversified business -- both geographically and within the energy sector. It has proven time and again that it knows how to survive every phase of the economic cycle in the highly volatile energy sector, where oil and natural gas prices can make dramatic and swift price moves. The clearest proof of that point is that Chevron has increased its dividend every year for 37 consecutive years.\n\nEqually important for those considering a new purchase now, Chevron's dividend yield is currently an attractive 4.1%. By contrast, at recent share prices, Occidental Petroleum's yield is just 1.4%. Clearly, if you are looking to maximize the income your portfolio generates, you won't want to make the change that Buffett just made. But if income isn't your top concern, the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio shift is worth considering.\n\nBuffett bought more Occidental Petroleum\n\nWarren Buffett's really big move with Occidental Petroleum came back in 2019 when he invested $10 billion in it directly to help provide financing for its purchase of Anadarko Petroleum. Somewhat ironically in retrospect, Oxy needed that extra cash so it could outbid Chevron. Things went south shortly thereafter for Occidental, since the economic shutdowns that nations around the world engaged in to slow the spread of the coronavirus in 2020 resulted in a steep drop in the price of oil. Occidental was forced to cut its dividend and redouble its efforts to strengthen its finances.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt muddled through that difficult period and is now back on the growth track. Management is regularly raising the dividend again and the company has even gotten back into the acquisition game -- its $12 billion purchase of CrownRock is expected to close this quarter. Here's the really interesting comparison: Energy industry giant Chevron has a market cap of $280 billion while Occidental Petroleum's market cap is \"just\" $55 billion.\n\nSure, neither company is exactly small, but Oxy will likely have an easier time expanding its business meaningfully than Chevron will. And Occidental is clearly attempting to act as an industry consolidator in an attempt to gain the scale it requires to compete with its larger peers. In this way, it is more of a growth story, and it looks like Buffett approves of the company's prospects. In fact, in June he went back for more, adding nearly 3 million more shares. If you are looking for an energy stock to add to your portfolio and you don't really care about income, then maybe you'll want to consider Buffett's recent decisions to favor Oxy over Chevron.\n\nYou don't need to make a move\n\nJust because a famous investor does something does not mean you should follow their lead. You have to make the calls that are best for you and your portfolio. If you are a conservative income investor, switching from Chevron to Occidental is probably a bad choice. But if you have more of a growth bent, or are seeking to build a portfolio that delivers a mix of growth and income, Buffett's shift highlights a key difference between giant Chevron and up-and-comer Oxy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Occidental Petroleum wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Time to Buy June's Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stocks?",
        "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) market index gained 1.1% in June 2024, but some of the business titans in that portfolio posted negative returns.\n\nAre these stumbling titans down for the count, or should you consider picking up a few shares of high-quality companies on the cheap? Come along as I take a look at two of the Dow's worst performers in June, aiming to separate low-priced wheat from barren chaff.\n\nNike: Down 20.7% in June\n\nLet's start with the biggest plunge. Athletic footwear and apparel giant Nike (NYSE: NKE) was doing alright for most of last month. The stock traded roughly sideways until June 27, followed by a 19% price drop on the month's final market day.\n\nNike's crash started with a mixed earnings report for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended May 31). The company exceeded Wall Street's consensus earnings target by 16% but missed its average revenue target by 2.3%.\n\nMore to the point, Nike's management signaled uncertainty about foreign exchange rates, the Chinese economy, and lifestyle product sales on the Nike Digital e-commerce platform.\n\nMany analyst firms immediately lowered their price targets for Nike's stock, some gave the shares a lower recommendation status, and the market took notice. As a result, Nike's stock is trading at prices not seen since the brief COVID-19 crash in March 2020.\n\nThe company faces many challenges right now. Issues like the wobbly Chinese economy and unfavorable exchange rates also apply to Nike's rivals, but soft e-commerce sales and overstuffed inventories across the supply chain should be more directly under the company's control.\n\nOn the upside, Nike is taking action. The company is rebalancing its product portfolio, introducing modern ideas like 3D-printed sneakers with artificial intelligence (AI) designs, and started cutting costs.\n\nIt may be tempting to grab a few Nike shares at a multiyear low price. However, slow going in the presumably high-growth e-commerce channel makes me concerned. Is the brand losing value in the eyes of younger consumers?\n\nMoreover, Nike's stock isn't on fire sale. Shares are valued at the modest ratios of 20 times earnings and 18 times free cash flows, indicating a fair value for a very mature stock.\n\nSo, I'll take a rain check on Nike's stock at this point. There are so many deeper value ideas to pursue before taking a chance on this shoe giant's potential turnaround.\n\nWalt Disney: Down 4.5% in June\n\nEntertainment powerhouse Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) took a different path to a milder price drop in June. Together with a sharper plunge in April, Disney's stock has burned the market goodwill it earned from a fantastic earnings report in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are investors casting a dim eye on Disney and its stock these days? Well, activist investor Nelson Peltz liquidated his Disney position after losing a proxy battle over the company's future. Peltz could have injected new ideas into Disney's business plan. In particular, he wanted Disney's board of directors to show some backbone when assessing legendary CEO Bob Iger's plans and ideas.\n\nThen again, Peltz's campaign may have achieved some of its goals differently. His capital management firm, Trian Partners, sold its Disney stake at a $1 billion profit. The challenge may also have given the management team and board of directors a fresh sense of fiscal responsibility. The company's streaming video adventures continue but only after selling off unprofitable operations, such as the Hotstar streaming service in India.\n\nDisney's valuation is comparable to Nike's in many ways and slightly loftier overall. In all fairness, I should probably keep my hands off this stock, too. However, I'm more impressed by Disney's streaming future and sector-spanning entertainment empire than Nike's struggles in a much narrower market.\n\nThere is a very small handful of stocks I watch like a hawk, scanning for poorly motivated price drops. Disney is on that list, and the current stock swoon strikes me as a solid buy-in opportunity.\n\nSo, there you have it. Nike and Disney both took a tumble in June, but their paths forward look quite different.\n\nNike's got some serious hurdles to jump before hitting its stride again, making it a difficult pick for now. On the flip side, Disney's broad entertainment empire and strategic moves in streaming make it a more intriguing buy during this stock dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walt Disney wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "During an episode of \"Ask KT and Suze Anything,\" personal finance expert Suze Orman criticized a 72-year-old caller's financial advisor for bad advice about switching insurance policies. Here\u2019s what happened during the podcast.\n\nOrman is a celebrated author and financial advisor known for her blunt but fair advice. During an episode of the \"Ask KT and Suze Anything\" podcast, which deals with all things money, Orman received a call from a 72-year-old woman named Judy, who has been retired for two years.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare ?\n\nCan you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nJudy revealed that she's doing OK financially and is paying her bills without problems. Just recently, she met with her financial advisor. Judy told her financial advisor that she had paid up her MetLife policy, valued at $16,000, with a death benefit of $26,000. Judy explained that she told her financial advisor that she had no long-term insurance. In response, her financial advisor told her she could trade in her policy with some additional money to help cover the cost of a long-term care policy. Judy told Orman she was confused about what to do because she had always thought the policy would be used for burial. Judy asked, \"Is it better to have long-term care? I've never heard about insurance policy conversion before to long-term care.\" Judy wanted to know if these policies were legitimate.\n\nOrman answered Judy's question, \"They're legit for a whole lot of money, Judy,\" and explained her thoughts on Judy's situation. Orman pointed out that doing one of these policy conversions is expensive. Orman asked Judy, \"Did he (her financial advisor) tell you how much extra money? Did he tell you how much extra per month to keep it going?\" Orman added, \"The older you get, the more expensive a long-term care policy is because the average age of entry into a nursing home is 84.\" Because Judy wanted her current policy to be used for burial, Orman pointed out that this meant that Judy wouldn't have enough money saved elsewhere to pay for her burial if she changed the policy.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nAnother potential problem that Judy may run into when converting her MetLife policy to a long-term care insurance policy is that she could risk losing the premiums she's paid over the years. Policy conversion can sometimes come with hidden costs. Orman explained, \"So normally, once you\u2019re in your seventies, most people can\u2019t even afford long-term care. And many of those policies today, and people know this who are listening to this, they are getting serious increases on their long-term care policies.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, what should she do?\n\nOrman told Judy that she should not follow her financial advisor's advice. Orman felt that Judy would most likely qualify for Medicaid if she went into a nursing home because she probably didn't have that much money, so she'd meet the qualifying criteria. Paying extra money monthly on a policy you won't need is pointless. Orman criticized Judy's financial advisor and told her, \"Do not do this, do not do this. Do not do this on any level. Maybe in a different situation.\"\n\nOrman also gave Judy some additional advice and told her that if the facts were different, she should visit the \"Women & Money\" app to speak with Phyllis Shelton before making any final decisions about her policies. According to Orman, Shelton is an expert on long-term care insurance, and \"Truthfully, I personally would never be buying a long-term care insurance policy unless I talked to Phyllis Shelton first.\"\n\nRead Next:\n\nHow do billionaires pay less in income tax than you?

        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a top stock for years, but it recently became a household name due its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Demand for Nvidia's chips has skyrocketed, and that's reflected in soaring revenue and profits. Investors quickly pounced on the opportunity, and Nvidia stock is up 783% over the past two years.\n\nLet's go back a little further and see where a $1,000 investment five years ago could have gotten you today.\n\nIt's not only the AI\n\nFive years ago, generative AI was a concept strictly for tech people, but Nvidia was already a top chipmaker. It created the GPU in 1999 and transformed the gaming industry, and its chips are used in various industries for data computing, including scientific applications and automotive. Because generative AI can be intensely consumer-facing, Nvidia has become a recognizable symbol of its power.\n\nLike most companies and industries, Nvidia has had its ups and downs. It gained 400% between the first two of the past five years, when the country was flooded with stimulus money and the markets were giddy with optimism. Then, it lost a full 50% of its value in 11 months due to the inflation and toppled markets that followed. Smart investors held on and are now reaping the benefits of buying a great stock and holding through periods of volatility.\n\nIf you'd invested $1,000 five years ago, which would have been just before the pandemic and the ensuing market chaos, you'd have a staggering $31,500 today.\n\nNVDA Chart\n\nCan Nvidia do it again? In the long term, it has plenty of opportunities. There might be some short-term pressure since Nvidia already sports a high valuation and deals with building competition. So the road may be bumpy over the next couple of years. But if you invest in Nvidia today and hold on across Wall Street's potholes, you should be richly rewarded down the line.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Forget Eli Lilly: 3 Biotech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "body": "A few years ago, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) was far from the hottest stock in the biopharmaceutical world. But times have changed. Today, Lilly ranks as the biggest healthcare company in the world. It still has tremendous growth prospects with its diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease drugs.\n\nSo is Lilly the top stock for healthcare investors right now? Nope. Forget Eli Lilly. Here are three biotech stocks to buy instead.\n\n1. Amgen\n\nYou might be surprised to see Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) on a list of better biotech stocks to buy than Eli Lilly. While Lilly's shares have soared more than 50% year to date, Amgen is up by only a high single-digit percentage. Amgen also posted a net loss in the first quarter of 2024 based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nHowever, Amgen blows Lilly away on one important front -- valuation. Its shares trade at less than 16.2 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, Lilly's forward earnings multiple is a sky-high 66.7.\n\nSure, Lilly should have stronger growth prospects, thanks especially to soaring sales for Mounjaro and Zepbound. This puts the drugmaker's lofty valuation in perspective. But Amgen has pretty good growth opportunities as well: Ten of the company's products generated double-digit volume growth in the first quarter. The company also has a loaded pipeline, with 25 late-stage programs.\n\nAmgen trounces Lilly when it comes to dividends, too. Lilly's forward dividend yield is 0.6%, only a fraction of Amgen's yield of 2.9%.\n\n2. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nMuch of Eli Lilly's anticipated growth is already baked into its share price, but I don't think that's the case for Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX). Granted, Vertex's forward earnings multiple of 29 is relatively high. However, its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.6, reflecting an attractive valuation.\n\nSome of Vertex's growth will come from its core cystic fibrosis (CF) market. The company enjoys a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. It could soon expand that monopoly with the pending U.S. and European approvals of a triple-drug CF combo featuring vanzacaftor.\n\nMost of Vertex's growth, though, is likely to come from non-CF drugs. It's ramping up the commercial launch of Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The big biotech innovator could also win U.S. approval of suzetrigine in treating acute pain in the first half of 2025.\n\nVertex is evaluating inaxaplin in a phase 3 study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). There are no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of AMKD, and it affects more patients than CF does. Vertex's pending acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences will give it another late-stage candidate, povetacicept, which targets the rare kidney disease IgA nephropathy.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Viking Therapeutics\n\nUnlike Lilly, Amgen, and Vertex, Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) doesn't have any approved products on the market yet. And Viking still isn't profitable. However, with a market cap of under $6 billion and a promising pipeline, this biotech stock could have the most room to run.\n\nEarlier this year, Viking announced spectacular results from a phase 2 study of its experimental obesity drug VK2735. The dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist achieved greater weight loss after 13 weeks of treatment than Lilly's tirzepatide (marked as Mounjaro and Zepbound) and Novo Nordisk's semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic and Wegovy) did in clinical trials.\n\nIf VK2735 is successful in phase 3 testing and goes on to win regulatory approvals, Viking will almost certainly be worth much more than it is today. And this drug isn't the only potential huge winner in the company's pipeline. Viking's VK2809 is in phase 2 testing as a treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Some analysts predict that the NASH therapy market could top $100 billion, rivaling the obesity drug market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amgen right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amgen, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amgen wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin Falls to Lowest Since February Even as Stocks Hit Record",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin sank for a fourth consecutive trading session, part of a wider crypto selloff that contrasts with recent record highs in global stocks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe digital asset fell as much as 8.1% to hit the lowest since February, changing hands at about $54,190 as of 12:21 p.m. Friday in Singapore. Smaller coins like Ether, XRP and Cardano nursed steeper losses in some cases exceeding 10%.\n\nCrypto speculators currently face a range of challenges, including waning demand for US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, signs that governments are disposing of seized tokens and the hard-to-parse impact of US political flux.\n\nOn top of that, administrators of the failed Mt. Gox exchange are returning a hoard of Bitcoin to creditors in stages. Speculators are uncertain how much of the $8 billion haul will end up being sold. A Mt. Gox-linked wallet moved $2.7 billion worth of the token on Friday, according to Arkham Intelligence.\n\nCorrelation Frays\n\nMeanwhile MSCI Inc.\u2019s gauge of global stocks is hovering near a record high and a short-term, 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the index is plunging. The question is whether risk aversion in crypto is isolated or heralds a circumspect quarter for mainstream investments too after a strong first-half for shares.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a general lack of buzz in crypto markets right now,\u201d said Stefan von Haenisch, head of trading at OSL SG Pte. \u201cMost news that is currently being spread, for example Mt. Gox selling, is more bearish in nature.\u201d\n\nVon Haenisch said crypto needs more dovish notes on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, adding \u201cone to two rate cuts, coupled with Fed balance sheet expansion, are two key ingredients that crypto is really waiting for.\u201d\n\nInvestors are awaiting US jobs data later Friday for the latest clues on the outlook for Fed policy. Soft recent economic reports have bolstered the case for the US central bank to loosen monetary settings in coming months.\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time peak of $73,798 in March, buoyed by unexpectedly strong demand for inaugural US ETFs for the token. The inflows have since ebbed, taking Bitcoin lower and casting a pall over the rest of the digital-asset market.\n\nApprovals for debut US ETFs for No. 2 ranked token Ether are pending, but interest in the products could be mixed if the crypto selloff continues.\n\nStory continues\n\nLiquidations\n\nOver $800 million worth of bullish crypto bets were liquidated in the past three days, one of the heaviest such liquidations since April, Coinglass data show.\n\n\u201cPoor weekend liquidity will exacerbate any moves triggered by liquidations, even small ones,\u201d said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider Orbit Markets. In the meantime, the return of US investors from the July 4 holiday should help bring some stability, she added.\n\nThe operators of the power-hungry computers that underpin the Bitcoin blockchain are continuing to absorb the financial hit of April\u2019s so-called halving, which curbed the new tokens they receive for the work they do. One response from these Bitcoin miners is to sell some of their inventory of tokens.\n\n\u201cThe $51,000-$52,000 range is crucial as a lot of Bitcoin miners are reaching their break-even point for profitable mining,\u201d said Le Shi, head of trading at market making and algorithmic trading firm Auros.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Can Plunge by Up to 56% in the Second Half of 2024",
        "body": "The first half of 2024 is in the books, and the bulls are still very much in control on Wall Street. The mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth stock-fueled Nasdaq Composite all powered to fresh record-closing highs.\n\nWhile a number of catalysts are responsible for Wall Street's gains, much of the credit goes to what's arguably the hottest trend since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s. I'm talking about the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe broad scope of AI involves using software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally undertake or oversee. What gives this game-changing technology such appeal is the ability of AI software and systems to learn without human intervention. The capacity to become more proficient at assigned tasks or perhaps evolve to learn new tasks/jobs gives artificial intelligence utility in most sectors and industries.\n\nAs you can imagine, estimates of how much AI can change the growth arc for businesses are all over the map. But according to a report released last year by the analysts at PwC, AI is expected to add $15.7 trillion (yes, with a \"t\") to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\n\nWith dollar figures this large, it's easy to understand why AI stocks have been the greatest thing since sliced bread in 2024. But among the vast sea of stocks that have benefited from the AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reigns supreme.\n\nThe all-important question is: How much longer can Nvidia remain on its pedestal?\n\nIf history has its say, Nvidia's glory days may already be in the rearview mirror.\n\nNvidia's operational ramp has been nothing short of textbook\n\nFor more than a year, Nvidia has scaled its operations at a level never before seen for an industry-leading business. After reporting $27 billion in full-year sales for fiscal 2023 (ended in late January 2023), Nvidia is expected to report north of $120 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025 (ended in late January 2025).\n\nIts innovative AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have made this rip-roaring sales and profit growth possible. In particular, Nvidia's H100 GPU has quickly become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. The analysts at TechInsights recently reported that Nvidia's chips accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI GPUs shipped last year.\n\nDespite its first-mover advantages, this leading AI company isn't sitting on its hands. While its competition aims to catch up to the H100 GPU, Nvidia plans to roll out its next-generation Blackwell chip later this year. CEO Jensen Huang also recently teased the company's \"Rubin\" AI GPU architecture, which is due out in 2026. It would appear that Nvidia isn't going to have any trouble sustaining its compute advantages.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, enterprise demand for AI chips has completely overwhelmed their available supply. This has been music to management's ears because it's allowed the company to meaningfully raise the price of its H100 chip. The ongoing scarcity of AI GPUs lifted Nvidia's adjusted gross margin above 78% in the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nBut when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street is typically when investors should worry.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nShares of Nvidia could tumble as much as 56% by year's end\n\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of a next-big-thing innovation or technological trend. In 2018, shares of the company were riding high thanks to surging prices for cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlthough not all digital currencies use a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to validate transactions on the blockchain, some of the most prominent cryptocurrencies do, such as Bitcoin. Validation with PoW is done via cryptocurrency mining.\n\nCryptocurrency miners run high-powered GPUs that solve complex equations and verify payments. The first miner to validate a group of transactions, known as a block, receives a block reward (tokens of the digital currency being mined). Nvidia's GPUs became the go-to hardware for cryptocurrency miners.\n\nBut shortly after the cryptocurrency bubble burst, Nvidia quickly gave up a significant portion of its prior gains. Fewer than three months after hitting its next-big-thing innovation peak in October 2018, shares of Nvidia had retraced by 56%!\n\nNVDA Chart\n\nWe've also witnessed rapid pullbacks play out with other industry-leading businesses when next-big-thing bubbles burst. Following Amazon's peak in December 1999, prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, it shed two-thirds of its value over the next six months. Cisco Systems plunged by 37% mere months after hitting its dot-com bubble high.\n\nI bring up Amazon and Cisco Systems because these were two industry leaders that traded at the priciest trailing-12-month (TTM) sales valuations before the dot-com bubble burst. On June 20, 2024, when Nvidia hit its all-time high, its TTM price-to-sales ratio was practically identical to Amazon's and Cisco's peaks.\n\nThe point being that if Nvidia did peak on June 20 at north of $140 per share, the decline from this pedestal is unlikely to be gradual. History has shown that once bubbles burst, industry leaders are taken to the woodshed rather quickly -- thus, my prediction that it could lose up to 56% from its high in the second half of 2024.\n\nNVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nBut this is only part of the story.\n\nIn addition to every next-big-thing innovation or technology undergoing a bubble-bursting event early in its existence, Nvidia is going to face its first real influx of competition. Well-known semiconductor juggernauts Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have respective AI-accelerating chips they'll be rolling out or ramping up production of during the second half of this year.\n\nHere's the interesting quirk Nvidia is contending with: Even if its H100 and Blackwell chips maintain clearly identifiable compute advantages, the company is still liable to lose market share. Nvidia is at the mercy of its suppliers, meaning it won't be able to meet demand for all its customers. This opens the door for AMD and Intel to fill the void.\n\nAs I've previously pointed out, Nvidia's top four customers are also developing their own AI GPUs. While these chips are unlikely to outperform Nvidia's AI GPU architecture, their mere presence signals a desire for the world's most influential businesses to lessen their reliance on the current AI leader.\n\nFurthermore, the sheer presence of these new AI GPUs taking up valuable AI-accelerated data center space implies that Nvidia's pricing power is going to ebb over time.\n\nHistory shows that the fall from grace when next-big-thing bubbles burst isn't pretty, and Nvidia's big-time move lower may have already begun.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Stock Split Is Over for Chipotle Mexican Grill and Shares Have Quickly Dropped More Than 10%. What It Means for Investors.",
        "body": "On June 26, restaurant company Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) did a 50-for-1 stock split -- one of the largest splits investors have ever seen. Anyone who owned just two shares of the company before now owns 100, thanks to this highly publicized event.\n\nHowever, Chipotle stock is down about 11% from the all-time high that it reached back in June, with much of the drop happening after the stock split. In fact, it's the largest pullback for Chipotle stock in almost a year.\n\nI have reason to believe that some Chipotle shareholders bought the stock entirely because of the stock split. A 2023 study published by the Journal of Risk and Financial Management found that a stock's trading volume usually increases with a stock-split announcement. And the trading volume generally goes up enough after a split that it's reasonable to assume that there are more shareholders after the split than there were before.\n\nTherefore, I believe some investors own Chipotle stock because it just did a huge 50-for-1 split. And these investors are likely upset to already be down sharply.\n\nWhy isn't Chipotle stock surging after the split?\n\nThe true value of a company isn't found in its stock price, but rather in its market capitalization. Each share represents a small, fractional ownership piece of the business. The market cap adds up the price of all the shares outstanding to arrive at the entire worth of the company.\n\nLet's assume that two different stocks both traded at $10 per share. If the first company had 1 million shares and the second company had 1 billion shares, the former would have a market cap of only $10 million whereas the other would have a market cap of $10 billion. In other words, the stock prices would be the same. But one company would be worth 1,000 times more than the other because it would have 1,000 times as many shares.\n\nWhen Chipotle split its stock, it instantly had 50 times as many shares as before. But it didn't do anything to create shareholder value nor was any value lost. This is because the stock price was also instantly about 1/50th what is was before. In other words, it was all a wash from a market-cap value perspective.\n\nIt may not have created any shareholder value with the stock split but Chipotle did create plenty of buzz. From the time the split was announced through when the split actually happened, Chipotle stock outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin -- investors were clearly excited.\n\nCMG Chart\n\nNow that Chipotle's stock split is in the past, excitement is ebbing, which has led to the lower stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat to do now\n\nDon't misunderstand: It was never a foregone conclusion that Chipotle stock would rise with the announcement of the split and then fall afterward. Investor sentiment can drive stock prices in any direction over the short term and sentiment is intrinsically unpredictable.\n\nThe actionable takeaway from all of this for investors is that there are things that can drive a stock's price over the short term. But sometimes these are things that don't actually create value, such as with stock splits. Therefore, these aren't things that should demand any focus.\n\nRather, investors in Chipotle (and other stocks) should develop an investment thesis -- a pithy explanation of how a company can create value in coming years. While an investment thesis plays out, market sentiment will rise and fall, creating volatility with a stock price. But those who calmly hold through the volatility can be rewarded with big gains.\n\nOver the long term, weightier matters such as revenue growth and profit margin improvements have a much greater impact on a stock's price than a split. And because this is true, long-term investors need to focus on those things.\n\nFor Chipotle shareholders who only bought shares because of the stock split, I'd say that you have more research to do before deciding whether this is a stock that you want to own for the long term. But allow me to give you a head start by explaining why the company can at least increase its revenue.\n\nChipotle owns all of its U.S. restaurants and it had almost 3,500 as of the end of its first quarter of 2024. However, in coming years, it plans to open hundreds of additional locations. Because these will also be owned by the company, it's likely that the company's revenue will meaningfully grow. And revenue growth is one of the most important things for a winning stock.\n\nFor Chipotle shareholders who do have an investment thesis that's unrelated from the stock split, be encouraged that nothing has fundamentally changed with the business. The stock is just down as sentiment adjusts like it always does.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "3 Magnificent S&P 500 Dividend Stocks Down 25% to 43% to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "body": "The S&P 500 index is a prestigious club comprising 500 of the most prominent American companies. A company that joins the S&P 500 only does so after careful consideration by a committee that aims to ensure the index includes only the cream of the crop.\n\nBut even stocks in the S&P 500 aren't immune to adversity. Some S&P 500 companies are struggling even as the index sits near all-time highs. Some of these stocks are down from their former highs by as much as 43%.\n\nInstead of chasing what's hot, consider why these three struggling stocks made the S&P 500 in the first place. Their current struggles don't change the fact they are wonderful buy-and-hold candidates worth considering for your portfolio today.\n\n1. A strong play on artificial intelligence\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is one of the index's newest members; it was added to the S&P 500 just a few months ago. The company began in electronic components in the early 1990s, but its primary business today is building modular server systems for data centers. Companies without the know-how or desire to custom-build data centers can turn to Super Micro Computer for turnkey systems.\n\nDemand for artificial intelligence (AI) has corporations heavily investing in data centers, which helped accelerate Super Micro Computer's revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarters. The stock has been a winner, surging over 200% over the past year. However, shares have cooled and are now down 31% over potential concerns about how sustainable this growth is.\n\nWhile triple-digit growth won't last forever, the future remains bright. Experts anticipate sustained investments in data centers over the coming years, which should steadily boost Supermicro's business.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has noted it's taking market share, which underlines its strong reputation in the field. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by over 50% annually for the next three to five years. That makes the stock a potential bargain today at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 34.\n\n2. A legendary consumer staples name getting back on its feet\n\nMost consumers are familiar with Clorox (NYSE: CLX) and its various household products from brands like Clorox, Pine-Sol, Brita, Glad, Burt's Bees, and more. Consumers gravitate toward these products due to name recognition, and people routinely buy them. That makes Clorox a durable business that performs well in good and bad times.\n\nClorox's stock has been uncharacteristically volatile; shares are down over 40% from their highs, its steepest drop since the early 2000s.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, what happened? First, the stock did very well during the pandemic due to increased demand for disinfectant products. Shares surged to over 40 times earnings, a very steep price for a consumer staples stock.\n\nThen, hackers breached Clorox last summer, disrupting the company's operations. The attack hit Clorox's supply chain, hurting the company's ability to process and fulfill orders. The breach was the catalyst that began the stock's reversion to a more reasonable price.\n\nClorox is getting back on its feet. Analysts anticipate revenue growth beginning next year and earnings growth of 10% annually for the next three to five years. While a P/E ratio of 40 was nonsensical, today's forward P/E of 23 makes the stock a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\n3. A leader in renewable energy\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) is the world's largest producer of renewable energy and America's largest electric utility business. The company has benefited from broad growth of renewable energy in America over the past several decades. Renewable energy is still just over 20% of all electric power generated in the United States, leaving a lot of room to grow over the upcoming decades. The company is also a well-known dividend growth stock; management has raised the dividend for 30 consecutive years.\n\nEnergy and utility businesses require a lot of investment to build new capacity and maintain infrastructure, so NextEra relies heavily on borrowing money. Rising interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which is a headwind for NextEra's business and has cooled sentiment on the stock. Shares have fallen over 20% from their high, though they've already rebounded from as much as 40% down.\n\nShares are still reasonably priced at just over 20 times earnings, notably below its average P/E of 28 over the past decade. Investors can expect continued demand for renewable energy to fuel steady growth for NextEra, which has helped the stock outperform the S&P 500 for decades. NextEra is an excellent company that is trading at a solid price today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Medical Properties Trust's High-Yielding Dividend Worth the Risk?",
        "body": "Medical Properties Trust (NYSE: MPW) is a risky stock to own -- no doubt about it. Anyone who has been following the company closely knows that it has been on a tough road the past few years, especially involving its troubled tenant, Steward Health. And the real estate investment trust (REIT) already had to reduce its dividend payments last year to give itself a bit more breathing room.\n\nSome investors, however, may still think this is a stock worth taking a chance on. After all, if a dividend cut has already happened, and if the bad news with Steward Health is coming to a head, then these negative factors are potentially already priced into the stock's current valuation. And if its current dividend is sustainable, it may be a bargain, because its yield remains incredibly high at around 14%.\n\nCould Medical Properties Trust be a stock worth taking a chance on right now, or should investors simply stay away from this troubled investment?\n\nIs Medical Properties' dividend really safe?\n\nOn May 9, Medical Properties posted its results for the first three months of 2024. And while the REIT incurred a loss, its normalized funds from operations (FFO) were a positive $0.24 per share. FFO is a key metric for REITs because it factors out impairment charges and one-time gains and losses. It can be a better indicator of just how well the company is able to pay its dividend.\n\nInvestors may point to that reasonably strong FFO number as proof that the company can afford its quarterly dividend of $0.15. But the problem is that the business is in the middle of a turbulent time. Medical Properties has been selling assets in order to strengthen its financial position and inject more liquidity into its operations. In the first five months of the year, the company says it has been able to raise $2.4 billion in liquidity (above its target of $2 billion) through the sale of assets.\n\nThe problem is that as it sells its interest in hospitals, it reduces the size of its portfolio, which means there will be fewer tenants paying rent. And with Steward Health still in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings, the biggest uncertainty still lies with what happens with arguably its most important tenant and its 31 hospitals. A year or two from now, Medical Properties' financials may look very different, and while its latest reported FFO figure may imply the dividend is sustainable today, that may not be the case in the future.\n\nFurther losses could offset the dividend income\n\nYou have the potential to generate a lot of dividend income from investing in Medical Properties Trust. To collect $1,000, for example, you might need to invest around $8,000 into the stock. And if the stock falls and you buy it at a lower price, you may need to invest even less than that.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut therein lies the danger: Medical Properties has been an awful investment to own over the years (it's down around 80% in just three years), and things aren't getting better right now. If you invest $8,000 into the stock and the REIT continues to pay dividends for the full year, then you've indeed earned around $1,000 in dividends. But if the stock falls by just 13% during that time, those losses would wipe out that dividend income.\n\nAnd depending on how the situation unfolds with Steward, there's the potential that Medical Properties reduces its dividend again, or potentially even suspends it if there's too much uncertainty. Not only could that jeopardize how much you might collect in dividends, but it may result in further stock losses as well.\n\nMedical Properties isn't worth gambling on\n\nIf you buy shares of Medical Properties Trust today, it's hard to not consider it a gamble at this point. Considering all of the unanswered questions about the REIT, it's impossible to determine whether this can be a safe investment to hold in your portfolio. It's not an investment I'd feel comfortable holding given all that risk.\n\nIf your priority is to collect dividend income, you're likely better off looking at other, safer dividend stocks to own. Medical Properties does possess a lot of potential upside if it can come out of all this a better company in the end, but that's still a big \"if\" at this point. I see the stock as a contrarian investment that is perhaps appropriate for people with a high risk tolerance, but it probably won't be a suitable option for risk-averse dividend investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Medical Properties Trust right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Medical Properties Trust, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Medical Properties Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "It's been a while since the term \"FAANG stocks\" captured investors' attention, mostly because these stocks aren't the red-hot names they used to be. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tickers have taken their place as the market's hot-button grouping.\n\nThe thing is, all five FAANG stocks are still incredible investments, and three of them are standout prospects you'll want to consider adding to your portfolio sooner rather than later.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMost investors know Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has (literally) been the market's most rewarding stock over the past three decades; shares are up more than 260,000% since their 1997 initial public offering. Most investors also understand, however, that the e-commerce giant's highest-growth days are in the past. It's simply too big now to continue growing at its historical pace.\n\nThat doesn't mean its future isn't bright, however. It's just different in a handful of compelling ways.\n\nOne of these ways is a relatively new, intense focus on profitability. Although the company has historically been more interested in expanding its footprint than turning a profit, for the past couple of years it's been closing and canceling warehouses that couldn't operate as cost-effectively as needed. It's streamlining all of its operations to cull costs.\n\nAnd it's working! While its first-quarter top line improved 13% year over year, operating income more than tripled. Notably, its international e-commerce operation swung from a regular loss to an operating profit of $900 million. That's the best this arm's done since early 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing.\n\nData source: Amazon Chart by author. Figures are in billions.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, is also firing on all cylinders, bouncing back from soaring operating expenses seen in late 2022 and 2023. Its first-quarter operating income of $9.4 billion is record-breaking and continues to improve. Look for more of the same, too. Mordor Intelligence believes the cloud market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of more than 16% through 2029.\n\nAmazon's newest business is on a roll as well. That's advertising. Amazon.com's third-party sellers forked over $11.8 billion to more prominently feature their products at the website, up 24% year over year.\n\nAmazon shares are already up more than 130% since early last year, reaching new records just last week. Given the profit growth in the near-term and long-term cards though, there's more upside ahead for this FAANG stock.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nIt would be easy to assume the worst for streaming powerhouse Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Suspiciously, after a clear slowdown in its customer growth, beginning next year the company will no longer disclose its subscriber numbers. The streaming market itself is also running into a saturation headwind, forcing its leading companies to partner up with peers and competitors to create more marketable bundles. Cable giant Comcast recently unveiled a cable TV package that included Netflix and Apple TV, for example, while Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are pairing up Disney+, Max, and Hulu in a bundle that will be priced at a discount and launched sometime this summer.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust because the crowded industry's maturing, however, doesn't mean Netflix is doomed. It's got a couple of key things working in its favor that could -- and should -- keep the stock's current rally going. One of them is the company's position within the streaming market.\n\nSee, it's not just the original name in the business that gave rise to all the others. It's also still the most popular and \"stickiest\" streaming platform. Nearly 270 million households pay for access to its content ... far more than any of its rivals. Meanwhile, streaming market research house Antenna reports Netflix's customer churn rate stands at only 2%, versus more than 4% for Disney+ and over 6% for Max, for perspective. For most U.S. households that pay for multiple streaming services, a \"Netflix-first and then the others\" kind of mindset still prevails. Habits are powerful.\n\nThe other matter working in Netflix's favor is the rise of ad-supported streaming services. While only about 40 million of its 270 million subscribers (roughly 15%) are paying a lower monthly price in exchange for watching the occasional television commercial, it's an option that will keep its service far more marketable for far longer than it might otherwise have been. Market research outfit Global Market Insight believes the ad-supported streaming market is set to grow at an annualized rate of more than 8% through 2032.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but not least, add Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of FAANG stocks to consider buying before the end of July.\n\nIt's not necessarily an easy name to get excited about owning right now. Although the stock was a must-have for years following 2007's debut of the iPhone, slowing iPhone sales -- which account for about half of Apple's revenue -- have prompted worries regarding its future growth.\n\nThere's a huge new growth catalyst already at work though. That's artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile there's no denying the company was late to the party, it's catching up quickly. Last month Apple unveiled several different AI features for its smartphones, tablets, and computers that will make its wares even more powerful technology (particularly as it pertains to generative artificial intelligence). As Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang writes, \"Apple's introduction of Apple Intelligence will position the company as the leader in the consumer AI experience.\"\n\nIt's not just Apple's consumer-facing artificial intelligence apps that hold so much promise, however. The company's also working on tech that most consumers will never actually see in action firsthand. For instance, it's working on the development of its own chips for use in AI data centers. Although Nvidia's dominance of this market isn't in any immediate danger, The Wall Street Journal reports that these chips could be based on a completely different sort of artificial intelligence called inference rather than the training-oriented architecture that's common right now.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly what Apple's AI future looks like. But, Apple's got a long history of success. Given Precedence Research's prediction that the worldwide AI market is set to grow an average of 19% through 2032 there's little doubt the company will win at least its fair share of the market's expansion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "'You Don't Have Time To Waste Money!' 59-Year-Old With Only $40,000 Saved Asks Dave Ramsey: Pay Down My Mortgage Or Save For Retirement?",
        "body": "'You Don't Have Time To Waste Money!' 59-Year-Old With Only $40,000 Saved Asks Dave Ramsey: Pay Down My Mortgage Or Save For Retirement?\n\nIn an episode of The Ramsey Show titled \"Should I Pay Down My Mortgage Or Save For Retirement?\", a caller named Dan from Colorado sought advice on whether to prioritize paying down his mortgage or saving for retirement. At nearly 59 years old, Dan shared his complex financial history, including owning a business for 21 years, facing significant debt, and securing a stable job later in life.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?\n\nHow do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\n\nDan\u2019s situation is not unique. Many people in their late 50s struggle with debt repayment and retirement savings. Dan\u2019s annual household income is approximately $145,000, and he has reduced his credit card debt from $92,000 to $5,000. However, he still owes $206,000 on his mortgage and has only $40,000 in retirement savings.\n\nDave Ramsey, a well-known financial advisor, provided a clear action plan for Dan. \"Write a check today and pay off the credit card,\" Ramsey advised, highlighting the need to cut up the credit card and stop relying on debt.\n\nNext, Ramsey recommended building an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses. Dan mentioned he had started saving and had $7,000 set aside. Ramsey suggested increasing this to around $20,000 to provide a solid financial cushion.\n\nAfter establishing the emergency fund, Ramsey advised Dan to save 15% of his income for retirement. This equates to about $20,000 annually. \"If you will save twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year for 10 years, you\u2019re gonna have about six or eight hundred thousand dollars,\" Ramsey explained, illustrating the potential growth of Dan\u2019s retirement fund.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nRamsey highlighted the importance of aggressively paying down the mortgage. By living on a strict budget and allocating significant portions of their income toward the mortgage, Dan and his wife could be debt-free much sooner than anticipated. \"Let\u2019s take fifty [thousand dollars] and throw it at the house a year,\" Ramsey suggested, projecting that the house could be paid off in about four years.\n\nFinally, Ramsey stressed the need for disciplined spending and budgeting to achieve financial stability. \"You guys have got to stop spending. You don\u2019t have time to waste money,\" he urged, emphasizing that strict budgeting and adherence to the baby steps would lead to long-term financial success.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral factors come into play when considering whether to pay down a mortgage or save for retirement. Paying off your mortgage can lead to significant interest savings over time and provide the psychological benefit of being debt-free. For example, if you pay an additional $188 per month on a 30-year mortgage, you could pay it off in 20 years, saving around $27,216 in interest.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nHowever, investing for retirement early can yield higher returns due to the power of compound interest. For instance, starting early allows investments to grow more substantially over time. A consistent investment of $10,000 annually with an average annual return of 8% can grow to nearly $2.8 million over 40 years.\n\nFor individuals like Dan, the decision can hinge on their financial situation and goals. If the mortgage interest rate is low and retirement savings are minimal, prioritizing retirement savings might be wiser to take advantage of compound interest and potential employer matches on retirement contributions. Conversely, if the psychological benefit of being debt-free is significant and the mortgage interest rate is relatively high, focusing on paying down the mortgage could be beneficial\u200b.\n\nUltimately, a balanced approach may work best for many. Paying off high-interest debts first, contributing to retirement savings, and making extra mortgage payments can provide a path to financial stability and growth. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to individual circumstances, ensuring both immediate financial security and long-term growth.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare ?\n\nCan you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

        "body": "Many people played \"follow the leader\" when they were in grade school. And many apply the basic premise of that game to various activities, including investing. When there is the potential to make or lose a lot of money, it pays to at least consider the opinions of those considered subject matter experts. That can mean paying attention to what most successful investors are doing.\n\nCathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, belongs to this group of highly regarded investors whose opinions carry considerable weight. Peeking inside her investment management firm's portfolios can yield excellent insights. In fact, let's consider two Cathie Wood stocks that look like strong picks for the next decade: Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y).\n\n1. Roku\n\nTo say that Roku isn't keeping pace with the current market would be an understatement. The company's shares are down by 36% this year. Roku is dealing with several headwinds. Revenue growth isn't as impressive as it once was, average revenue per user is stagnating, and the streaming specialist still isn't consistently profitable.\n\nThat said, Roku has plenty of things going its way, too. It remains the leader in the connected TV (CTV) market, with a 48% slice of the pie as of the first quarter. No other company even comes close (the next best was at 11%), and that's saying something considering Roku's competitors. They include Amazon and Samsung.\n\nRoku's deepening ecosystem is likely helping it maintain its lead in the industry. It ended the first quarter with 81.6 million connected households, an increase of 14% year over year. Roku benefits from the network effect. The more households there are in its ecosystem, the more attractive it becomes to streaming companies and advertisers.\n\nAnd even though the company's revenue growth isn't as strong as it once was, there is still massive potential ahead for Roku. Cable TV is slowly fading away. Streaming is on the rise. The transition won't be complete for many, many years. That's why streaming platforms have been growing like weeds over the past few years. It's hard to keep track of how many there are now, although it's pretty clear that Netflix remains one of the undisputed leaders.\n\nNo matter who wins out in the end, though, Roku will benefit because it is not directly in competition with Netflix. Its platform merely allows consumers to access the most prominent streaming channels in one convenient spot. And as advertising dollars follow viewers into streaming channels, Roku will benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts growing ecosystem should also work wonders for its margins (the sale of its namesake streaming devices isn't particularly profitable). So, expect revenue to keep trending up, margins to improve, and, eventually, Roku to become consistently profitable. In my view, it's a good time to invest in the streaming giant while its shares are down.\n\n2. Adyen\n\nAdyen is a fintech specialist headquartered in the Netherlands. Its platform combines several services typically offered by two or more separate institutions. Adyen is an acquirer that also provides payment gateways (the online version of point-of-sales systems), payment processing, and risk management services, all in a single integrated platform. Adyen's services are particularly useful for multinational corporations that otherwise have to rely on different providers for these services in different regions.\n\nThough Adyen's financial results are pretty strong, they have fallen short of investors' expectations over the past few quarters. That's especially a problem because the company decided to squeeze its margins and bottom line by spending money on expansion plans and onboarding more employees, even as many other corporations did the exact opposite amid economic troubles. That's why Adyen hasn't performed well on the stock market recently. That said, it should be able to bounce back and deliver solid returns over the long run.\n\nConsider that in the first quarter, the company's revenue of 438 million euros ($470 million) increased by 21% year over year. Its processed volume of 297.8 billion euros ($319.6 billion) was up by 46% compared to the year-ago period. Even if Adyen's growth pace has fallen somewhat, it hasn't exactly landed in a bad place. Few fintech companies worldwide can match or exceed the company's payment volume.\n\nFurthermore, Adyen benefits from a strong moat. Corporations rely on its services to process and accept payment in day-to-day activities. That's not something they will want to disrupt, which gives Adyen high switching costs.\n\nFinally, the fintech giant still has plenty of room to run, particularly in North America, where its revenue has been growing faster than in any other region. Adyen should remain a leader in the fintech industry for a long time, and long-term, growth-oriented investors will likely find what they are looking for in this company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Roku wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Shares in South Korea\u2019s SK Hynix Inc., a key supplier to Nvidia Corp., have jumped more than 90% over the past year and Wall Street is predicting further gains.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNo fewer than 19 analysts have upgraded their forecasts over the past month for the firm, the largest supplier of high-bandwidth memory chips to Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence products. Reasons they give include the sky-high potential for AI, and the prospect of a positive surprise in this month\u2019s earnings.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded its stock-price target to 290,000 won ($210) on Tuesday, implying a potential gain of 25% from that day\u2019s close. Citigroup Inc. last week raised its prediction to 350,000 won, more than 50% higher than the current share price.\n\n\u201cThe current share valuation isn\u2019t fully reflecting the potential of high-bandwidth memory chips,\u201d said Roh Jongwon, chief investment officer at Infinity Global Asset Management Co. in Seoul. \u201cThe market is treating HBM\u2019s valuation the same as traditional memory chips, but HBM is almost twice as profitable.\u201d\n\nSK Hynix will report a second-quarter operating profit of 5 trillion won, the most in six years, when it announces earnings on July 26, according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would continue its turnaround from last year\u2019s losses amid a recovery in memory-chip prices helped by demand for high-end devices for AI applications.\n\nCiti arrived at its 350,000 won price target \u2014 the most bullish among analysts\u2019 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg \u2014 by taking previous peaks in SK Hynix stock and adding some discount, said Peter Lee, head of global tech and communication at Citigroup Global Markets Korea Securities Ltd.\n\nDemand for HBM may not be fully reflected yet as the world is unfamiliar with the potential of AI, Lee said, citing the earlier introduction of smart phones. \u201cBecause this is a market that didn\u2019t exist in the past, we have never seen how far it can go.\u201d\n\nGetting Expensive\n\nStill, some investors say there\u2019s reason to be cautious as multiples head higher. SK Hynix is now trading at 2.9 times book value, making it the most expensive since at least 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe have entered uncharted territory in terms of the valuation,\u201d said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. in Seoul. \u201cI think its earnings will beat market expectations this year and next year, but the markets are still uncertain about that.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are also getting jittery.\n\nSK Hynix shares sank as much as 4.7% Thursday following local media reports that Samsung Electronics Co. will soon enter talks with Nvidia to supply the US company with its own version of HBM chips. Samsung later denied the reports.\n\nThere are also concerns about a potential oversupply of memory chips after SK Hynix on June 30 announced a $75 billion investment plan through 2028. Increasing output may depress chip prices and raise the specter of a downturn in the memory industry.\n\n\u201cBecause this is an untrodden path, volatility is inevitable,\u201d Citigroup\u2019s Lee said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "28% Off All-Time Highs, Is AMD Stock a Buy?",
        "body": "While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported stellar Q1 earnings, computer processor and graphics card maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) relatively underperformed, only meeting expectations. This led to a decline in the stock price, post-earnings. However, investors must note that NVDA is a few quarters ahead of AMD. AMD is showcasing impressive growth in its AI-driven Data Center revenues, which will ultimately flow into margins and profits. Therefore, I am bullish on AMD stock.\n\nAMD\u2019s Muted Q1 Earnings Failed to Impress Investors\n\nOn April 30, AMD reported Q1 EPS of $0.62, in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. The figure came in a mere 3.33% higher than the Q1FY23 figure of $0.60 per share. Q1 revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year to $5.47 billion, also roughly in line with consensus estimates. Robust Data Center segment revenues somewhat offset the weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments, but the overall Q1 results were lackluster.\n\nCrucially, Data Center revenue growth continued to impress, growing an impressive 80% year-over-year during the quarter, driven by the launch of its latest MI300 AI accelerators, Ryzen, and EPYC processors. Disappointingly, however, Gaming revenue fell 48% year-over-year due to a decline in gaming chip sales. Further, adjusted gross and operating margins were uninspiring, standing at 52% (78.4% for Nvidia) and 21%, respectively.\n\nNext, AMD\u2019s revenue guidance met street expectations. For Q2, total revenue is expected to be around $5.7 billion (+/- $300 million). Positively, however, management raised the outlook for data center GPU sales, which are now expected to come in at $4 billion versus $3.5 billion guided earlier. The firm\u2019s adjusted gross margin is forecast to be approximately 53%.\n\nAMD\u2019s AI Product Roadmap Presents Strong Growth Potential\n\nA relatively underwhelming Q1 print and fears of AI demand waning have led to a 28% decline in AMD\u2019s stock from its all-time high of $227 in March 2024 to around $164 currently.\n\nHowever, investors should note that AMD is the closest competitor to NVDA. It is well known that AMD\u2019s GPUs are a cheaper alternative to NVDA\u2019s GPUs. Given the clear gap between demand and supply due to limited manufacturing capacity, the surge in the popularity of AI creates an opportunity for AMD chips to fill in the gap.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced that its cloud computing customers using Azure can opt for AMD\u2019s MI300 chips along with NVDA\u2019s H100 GPUs. This will give customers an alternative in case of overall supply constraints or clients\u2019 individual budgetary constraints. Notably, AMD\u2019s MI300 accelerator, which competes with NVDA\u2019s H100 chips, costs 33% less.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Nvidia is currently leading in the AI and GPU markets with over 80% market share, AMD\u2019s competitive pricing and performance improvements could help it gain market share over time. It is worth noting that MI300 is reckoned as the fastest-ramping product in the history of AMD. Launched just two quarters ago, it has already crossed the $1 billion sales milestone.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that AMD\u2019s management has been consistently increasing the outlook for MI300 sales for the past three quarters. There is a strong likelihood that the sales increase trend will continue for the upcoming quarters as well.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that AMD has a wider variety of offerings compared to NVDA. While NVDA is well-known for its powerful GPUs for data centers, AMD caters to a wider range that includes CPUs for PCs and GPUs for the gaming industry. During COVID-19, the PC market saw roaring demand. Now, it\u2019s time again for users to move to new PCs with upgraded technology. AMD is a key supplier to the high-end PC market and is bound to benefit from the uptick in demand for PCs.\n\nFurther, both NVDA and AMD continue to unveil their newest products, including accelerators and processors. While AMD launched its MI300 accelerators in December 2023, NVDA launched its Blackwell GPUs in March 2024.\n\nIn response to NVDA\u2019s pace of innovation, AMD\u2019s CEO Lisa Su also announced an annual cadence of new product launches at the Computex show held on June 2. The product roadmap looked impressive with newer launches year-on-year expected to incrementally add to revenues and profits.\n\nNotably, AMD has consistently undertaken acquisitions to enhance its data center offerings. For instance, it acquired Xilinx in February 2022 and Pensando Systems in May 2022. Moreover, the acquisitions have not yet been integrated to their full potential and are expected to yield a $10 billion cross-selling opportunity, as cited by management. With its acquisitions, its total addressable market continues to grow, having increased to $300 billion currently from just under $80 billion in FY2020.\n\nAMD\u2019s Valuation Is Not Cheap but Still Appears Reasonable\n\nSurprisingly, AMD is trading at a high forward P/E multiple (47x), slightly higher than the AI prodigy Nvidia, which is trading at a forward P/E of 45x. What could be the reason for AMD\u2019s high valuation despite lagging behind NVDA\u2019s inspiring results? The answer is clear: AMD will likely follow in NVDA\u2019s footsteps in the next few years, as its AI growth story is just beginning.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider whether it\u2019s worth buying AMD at current levels. Wall Street analysts expect AMD\u2019s EPS to be approximately $5.59 in FY2025 (with expectations of around $6.50 in FY2026). If AMD keeps the same forward P/E multiple of 47x by then, its share price will be about $275, or 68% higher than the current price.\n\nPutting it differently, AMD shares are trading at a P/E of 28x its FY2025 EPS estimate, implying a 35% discount to its five-year historical average of 43x.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to consider buying AMD stock at current levels, given the strong growth fundamentals in the AI space.\n\nIs Advanced Micro Devices Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe sentiment among Wall Street analysts is decidedly positive regarding Advanced Micro Devices stock. The stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating, with 28 Buy recommendations and seven Holds. AMD stock\u2019s average price target of $191.03 implies 16.6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider AMD for the Long-Term AI Potential\n\nThere is a clear-cut demand for AI across a broad range of industries as companies look to build their own data center infrastructure. This implies that strong growth in sales for AI chips, GPUs, and CPUs will continue for at least some years. AMD\u2019s advancements in AI and data center solutions position the company well for future growth, and its competitive pricing will help it gain market share over time.\n\nFurthermore, AMD has a strong foothold in the AI market for PCs and will likely continue to win market share. The impending PC upgrade cycle with AI-enabled PCs will add to sales and margin growth for AMD in the coming quarters. Given my bullish stance, I view the current share price weakness as a buying opportunity.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Apple or Nvidia: Which Will Get to $4 Trillion First?",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently hit a $3 trillion market cap and is now among the three most valuable companies in the world. Right above it in valuation is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with a market cap of just under $3.4 trillion, while Microsoft is currently in the top spot at just over $3.4 trillion.\n\nThough Microsoft is a tech stalwart and a safe stock, I think Apple and Nvidia both possess better growth prospects in the long run. So which of them is the most likely to reach a $4 trillion valuation first?\n\nNvidia sports a mammoth growth rate\n\nIt's hard to bet against Nvidia when you consider just how well its business has performed of late. The company is the leading provider of the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that other tech companies need to develop their next-gen software and models. And with AI infrastructure and development still in its early stages, Nvidia could be on the cusp of much more growth.\n\nThat's in stark contrast to Apple, which has been struggling lately to grow its top line at all.\n\nAAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nBut there is reason to expect that the gap between these growth rates will shrink. While Nvidia is a growth beast, it isn't likely to continue tripling its revenue on a year-over-year basis. As it starts lapping its latest huge numbers, it will become more difficult for it to keep its growth rate so high. And with so many companies loading up on AI chips, Nvidia may be punching above its weight right now. As more competing chips come to market in quantity and chip buyers potentially ease up on their AI-related spending, its growth rate could come down drastically.\n\nOn the flip side, Apple's growth rate should improve thanks to its recently unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will inject AI capabilities into its latest iPhones, Macs, and iPads. That will give users an incentive to get the latest Apple devices when they come out later this year, so it could be the catalyst for a strong upgrade cycle. As Apple dives deeper into AI and enhances its services, it has the potential to tap into more growth opportunities down the road.\n\nApple has the friendlier valuation\n\nWhat may be the biggest impediment for Nvidia's stock to rally much higher in the near future is its extremely high valuation of more than 70 times earnings.\n\nAAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nTrading at a much more modest P/E ratio of around 34, Apple could have more room to rise, especially if its growth rate improves. Meanwhile, Nvidia's multiple means it will have a high bar to meet each and every time it reports earnings. That leaves the stock vulnerable to a sell-off should it have a quarter that falls short of expectations or if management offers a forecast that isn't sufficiently rosy.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile things are going well for Nvidia today, that doesn't mean it will be able to maintain its current pace.\n\nMy prediction: Apple hits $4 trillion first\n\nBoth of these stocks make for good long-term investments, but if I were buying shares today, I would pick Apple over Nvidia.\n\nThere is a lot of excitement around Nvidia now, and that has me concerned that expectations for it may have climbed too high. Apple may not be as popular with growth investors today, but it shouldn't be counted out as it still has a lot more room for growth left.\n\nAnd Apple is the stock that I think will hit $4 trillion first, beating out both Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar: 2 Remarkable Growth Stocks to Buy Now for the Bull Market",
        "body": "The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) entered a bull market in December 2022. In the 18 months or so since, the technology-heavy index has advanced by 76% amid surging interest in artificial intelligence. But based on historical patterns, those gains are likely just the beginning.\n\nSince 1990, the Nasdaq has returned an average of 215% during bull markets that had average durations of about 40 months. If the current bull market aligns precisely with the historical average, then the Nasdaq will climb by another 139% from its cyclical low during the next 22 months.\n\nThat does imply a somewhat unrealistic return of 61% annually. But investors still have good reason to believe the Nasdaq will soar over time. The index has risen by a total of 2,420% during the last two decades, or 11.3% annually. That period encompassed such a broad range of economic conditions that it's reasonable for investors to expect similar returns in the future.\n\nWith that broad outlook in mind, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) would be worthwhile investments to consider buying now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet derives most of its revenues from digital advertising and cloud computing. Its Google subsidiary is the largest ad tech company in the world due to its ability to engage internet users and collect data. It owns six consumer-facing products and services that reach 2 billion monthly users each, among them Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. That reach and the insight it provides are valuable to advertisers. So much so that according to a forecast from Emarketer, Google will soak up 27.4% of digital advertising revenue worldwide in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud is the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services. Google Cloud trails Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure by a wide margin in market share, but it did gain a percentage point over the past year, and that trend could continue as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) consume a greater portion of IT budgets.\n\nIndeed, a recent CIO survey from Morgan Stanley predicted that Microsoft would be the cloud provider that will see the largest incremental share gain in AI/ML workloads over the next three years, but it forecast that Google would be the second-largest beneficiary in that space. Supporting that conclusion was the early success of multimodal model Gemini, designed to compete with the models that power ChatGPT. Google's Gemini is currently the second most popular AI cloud service.\n\nAlphabet showed financial strength in the first quarter, with growth accelerating on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 15% to $80.5 billion due to strong momentum in the Google Cloud segment, which also includes Google Workspace office productivity software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income soared 57% to $23.7 billion, a gain that was helped along by disciplined expense management.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough 2027, Wall Street analysts estimate that Alphabet will grow earnings per share at an annualized rate of 16%. That forecast makes its current valuation of 28.2 times earnings seem reasonable. From that level, I think Alphabet has a good shot at outperforming the Nasdaq over the next three to five years.\n\n2. Roku\n\nRoku connects streaming content publishers and advertisers with consumers. It is the leading streaming video platform in the U.S. as measured by streaming hours, and its Roku OS is the best-selling TV operating system in the U.S. and Mexico. Approximately 40% of smart TVs sold in those nations during the first quarter were Roku TVs.\n\nAdditionally, it offers on-demand content and live television through The Roku Channel, an ad-supported streaming service that consistently ranks as one of the most popular channels on the platform. Indeed, The Roku Channel recently surpassed Peacock (owned by Comcast) and Max (owned by Warner Bros. Discovery) to become the seventh-most-popular streaming service in the U.S.\n\nRoku reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter. Revenue rose 19% to $882 million, a sequential acceleration from 14% growth in Q4 2023. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA improved to $41 million, a big flip from its EBITDA loss of $69 million in the prior-year period. Investors have good reason to believe that the favorable momentum will continue.\n\nEmarketer forecasts that U.S. connected TV ad spending will increase at an annualized rate of 13% through 2027. Roku is set to benefit from that growth due to its superior ability to engage viewers, as evidenced by its leadership position among streaming platforms and the growing popularity of The Roku Channel.\n\nRoku also stands to benefit from its recently announced partnership with The Trade Desk, the largest independent ad tech platform for media buyers. Specifically, Roku will share data with advertisers using The Trade Desk to help them \"better understand and optimize their campaigns for TV streaming viewers.\" That should make Roku's ad inventory even more compelling.\n\nOn average, Wall Street analysts expect Roku's sales to increase by 12% annually through 2027. I think that estimate leaves room for upside surprises, given that the broader connected TV advertising market is forecast to grow even more quickly. However, even if Wall Street is correct, the stock still looks reasonably valued at its current price-to-sales ratio of 2.4, and Roku has a good shot at outperforming the Nasdaq over the next three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "In most cases, when selling your primary residence you can exclude $500,000 of the gain if you file as a married couple. If that\u2019s your situation, and you meet conditions to have the gain qualify as a long-term capital gain, you likely won\u2019t owe any tax. If you file singly while still meeting long-term capital gain conditions, you can only exclude $250,000. In that case you\u2019d likely owe taxes on $230,000 of the gain.\n\nHowever, your actual tax bill can vary widely depending on your situation and the tax-management strategies you employ. You may have to pay taxes on some, all or none of your net, depending on circumstances. If you\u2019re evaluating tax consequences of selling your home, consider talking it over with a financial advisor.\n\nCapital Gains Tax Basics\n\nAs a rule, any time you sell an investment for more than you paid, you owe taxes on the gain. This applies to your principal residence as well as stocks, bonds and other assets. If you owned the asset for more than a year, you\u2019ll owe long-term capital gains taxes of 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your income. If you sold the asset after owning it for less than year, the gain is added to your ordinary income which is taxed according to the current income tax brackets.\n\nWhen it comes making a profit by selling your primary residence, special rules apply. The main ones are the $250,000 exclusion for single filers and the $500,000 exclusion for married joint filers. The exclusion means you can deduct this amount from the net gain on the sale. You\u2019re only taxed on what is left afterward and, if there\u2019s nothing left, you\u2019ll owe no tax.\n\nSpeak with a financial advisor to navigate the nuances of taxes in your own situation.\n\nCapital Gains Tax in Action\n\nMuch depends on individual circumstances when it comes to taxes on sale of a residence. Here\u2019s what could happen in four different simplified scenarios:\n\nScenario One: You are married filing jointly, owned and lived in the home for two of previous five years and haven\u2019t used the exclusion in the last two years. In this case, all of the $480,00 gain would be covered by your $500,000 exclusion. You\u2019d owe no taxes on the sale.\n\nScenario Two: You are single filing jointly, owned and lived in home for two of the previous five years and haven\u2019t used the exclusion in previous two years. You can exclude $250,000 of the net, but you\u2019ll owe long-term capital gains at the rate of 15% on $230,000 of the gain. The tax bill would be $34,500.\n\nScenario Three: You have owned the home for at least a year but you haven\u2019t lived there for two of the previous five years or you have used the exclusion in the previous two years. You can\u2019t exclude any of the gain and you\u2019ll likely owe capital gains tax of 20% of the $480,000, or $96,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nScenario Four: You haven\u2019t owned the home for at least a year. In this case, the entire $480,000 gain will be added to your ordinary income and be taxed according to the current income tax rates. Your rate will depend on your other income and your filing status. However, the added income is likely to push you into the 35% bracket at least.\n\nA financial advisor can help you integrate your retirement and tax objectives. Get matched to a fiduciary advisor for free.\n\nOther Strategies\n\nIf you find yourself owing taxes on sale of your primary home, there are some moves you can make to reduce the bill. The first is to make sure you have accurately calculated the adjusted cost basis when figuring your net. To do this, add the home\u2019s initial purchase price to agent commissions and legal fees paid in connection with the transaction. Also add money you\u2019ve spent for remodeling, additions or improvements. Now subtract this total from the sale price. This is your taxable net gain.\n\nFor instance, say as a single filer you bought the home for $300,000 15 years ago. You sold it recently for $780,000 and you\u2019re using that to calculate your $480,000 net gain. As the seller you paid a 6% real estate agent commission of $46,800, plus $5,000 in eligible legal fees. You put in a $40,000 pool a few years ago, and replaced the roof for $15,000 a while back. These sums amounting to $106,800 can be added to the $300,000 purchase price to generate an adjusted cost basis of $406,800. Now your instead of owing taxes on $230,000, you\u2019ll owe taxes on just $123,200.\n\nIf you\u2019re an investor, you may be able to use offsetting capital losses to lower your taxable gain. For instance, if you lost $50,000 on a stock trade that was realized during the current tax year, you may be able to reduce your capital gain on the home sale by a similar amount. Some conditions apply, such as that you use short-term capital losses to offset short-term capital gains first and the same for long-term capital gains. However, you may be able to cut your tax bill if you have other capital losses.\n\nRules on taxing gains from sale of your primary home change from time to time. For instance, at one time you could defer gains. However, that option no longer exists since it was replaced by the current system of exclusions. Another gain-deferral strategy, using like-kind exchanges, only applies to investment properties.\n\nYou may be able to qualify for partial exclusion of the gain if you meet specific requirements, such as you or your spouse being transferred to a workplace at least 50 miles further away than your previous workplace. Health conditions, divorce and unemployment may also open the door to a partial exclusion.\n\nConsider speaking with a fiduciary financial advisor if you have questions about your personal circumstances.\n\nBottom Line\n\nYou can avoid paying any taxes on the gain if you\u2019re married and have lived in the home for at least two of the previous five years and haven\u2019t used the $500,000 principal residence capital gains exclusion in at least two years. If you\u2019re single, you\u2019ll likely pay taxes on at least some of the gain. However, a number of factors other than marital status, length of time in the home and previous exclusion use also may come into play. Depending on the details, you could owe from zero to many thousands of dollars.\n\nTips\n\nYou don\u2019t have to grapple with the complexities of managing taxes on your home sale by yourself. A financial advisor can provide insight. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors in your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nSmartAsset\u2019s Capital Gains Tax Calculator makes short work of figuring both long- and short-term capital gains taxes.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/thepalmer\n\nThe post I\u2019m Selling My House and Netting $480k.

        "body": "The late Charlie Munger said saving the first $100,000 was always the hardest. But crossing that milestone can make it much easier to build millionaire-making gains with bolder long-term investments.\n\nAssuming its valuations hold steady, a company would need to grow its revenue or earnings at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 26% over the next decade to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 million. That might seem like a high bar to clear, but MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL), and Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) could make the cut. Let's find out a bit more about these three stocks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre is Latin America's largest e-commerce company. It operates across 18 countries but generates most of its sales in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. It also owns Mercado Pago -- a digital payments platform integrated into its online marketplace and third-party businesses -- and other fintech services. It was founded more than two decades ago, and its early mover advantage gives it an edge against its regional and domestic challengers.\n\nMercadoLibre's revenue grew at a CAGR of 54% in U.S. dollar terms from 2020 to 2023, even as its top markets faced tough macro and inflationary headwinds. It also turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2021 and grew its earnings per share (EPS) at a CAGR of 127% from 2021 to 2023. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 24% as its EPS grows at a CAGR of 48%.\n\nMercadoLibre's management expects that robust growth to be driven by new customers, the expansion of its fintech ecosystem, and the dilution of the company's payment processing and logistics costs. Its stock looks reasonably valued at 47 times forward earnings and 4 times this year's sales, and it could soar even higher over the next decade as the Latin American e-commerce market expands.\n\n2. Duolingo\n\nDuolingo became the world's most downloaded language learning app by gamifying the experience with gems and other rewards. It monetizes its free users with ads, while its paid subscribers get an ad-free experience with extra perks. Duolingo also provides other phonics, math, and music apps and a stand-alone English proficiency test.\n\nDuolingo went public three years ago, and its revenue grew at a CAGR of 49% from 2021 to 2023. It also turned profitable on a GAAP basis in 2023. Between the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2023, its monthly active users (MAUs) more than doubled, its daily active users (DAUs) more than tripled, and its number of paid subscribers more than quadrupled. In 2023, it generated 80% of its bookings from subscriptions, which are more resistant to economic downturns than its ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Duolingo's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 30% as its GAAP EPS increases at a CAGR of 131%. Its stock isn't cheap at 116 times forward earnings, but it also doesn't seem terribly expensive at 12 times this year's sales. If Duolingo continues to dominate the language learning market as it expands its ecosystem, it could generate impressive multibagger gains over the next 10 years.\n\n3. Zscaler\n\nZscaler provides zero-trust services that treat everyone, including a company's CEO, as a potential threat. But unlike many other cybersecurity companies that install on-site appliances, Zscaler only provides its tools as cloud-based services -- which are cheaper, stickier, and easier to scale as an organization expands.\n\nZscaler's revenue grew at a CAGR of 55% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last July). That growth was driven by the market's robust demand for its zero-trust services, even as the macro headwinds made it tougher to lock in new customers. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 26%. That's still a solid growth rate for a stock that trades at 11 times next year's sales.\n\nZscaler isn't profitable on a GAAP basis yet, and its stock declined by about 10% this year amid concerns regarding its slowing sales growth and rising research & development and marketing expenses. However, analysts expect it to turn profitable by fiscal 2026.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the zero-trust market could grow at a CAGR of 17% from 2023 to 2030. If Zscaler's cloud-native approach helps it grow at a faster clip than the broader market, its stock could have plenty of upside potential.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "SPYI ETF: Get Paid Every Month, Enjoy the Massive Yield",
        "body": "What\u2019s better than getting paid a dividend every quarter? How about getting paid one every month? That\u2019s exactly what the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) has to offer investors, and it also comes with a massive dividend yield.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on this new monthly dividend ETF from NEOS based on this attractive payout schedule and its show-stopping 11.6% dividend yield, which is an incredible nine times higher than the yield of the S&P 500 (SPX).\n\nWhat Is the SPYI ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nAccording to fund sponsor NEOS, SPYI \u201cseeks to distribute high monthly income generated from investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and implementing a data-driven call option strategy.\u201d\n\nThe fund \u201cutilizes a call option strategy that may include both sold and purchased SPX index options, which may provide the opportunity for upside capture in rising equity markets.\u201d\n\nEssentially, SPYI owns the stocks in the S&P 500. It then generates monthly income for its holders through both the dividend payments from these stocks and by selling call options on the S&P 500 to generate additional income via the premiums from these options contracts.\n\nWhile this generates a high level of monthly income, investors should also note that by utilizing this strategy, they are potentially sacrificing some level of upside from capital appreciation. If SPYI\u2019s holding rises above the strike price for the covered call contracts it sells to generate this income, SPYI will forgo much of this additional upside.\n\nYou can see this dynamic in play by looking at the ETF\u2019s results. For example, in 2023, SPYI generated a total return (which includes price appreciation and dividends) of 18.1% for the year. While this was a strong return, it underperformed the S&P 500\u2019s return of 26.3% for the year.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing that SPYI does a bit differently from other ETFs employing this covered call strategy. Rather than investing all of the money it receives from selling call contracts, it has the option to reinvest some of the proceeds back into buying cheaper, further out of the money call options, allowing it to participate in some of this upside if the underlying holding goes beyond the strike price.\n\nAs NEOS explains in the fund\u2019s summary prospectus, the fund seeks to use the S&P 500 call options \u201cto generate a net-credit, meaning that the premium received from the sale of the call options will be greater than the cost of buying the long, out-of-the-money SPX call options.\u201d\n\nIncredible Dividend\n\nWhile the strategy is complex and has some pros and cons regarding capital appreciation and total return, there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s a powerful way to generate significant income. This is evidenced by SPYI\u2019s mouth-watering 11.6% dividend yield, which is about nine times higher than that of the S&P 500 (currently yielding just 1.3%).\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only that, but SPYI\u2019s yield is easily more than double the 4.35% yield offered by 10-year treasury bonds, making SPYI a compelling income investment no matter what type of interest rate environment we find ourselves in.\n\nETFs employing this strategy have grown in popularity in recent years, and it\u2019s worth noting that SPYI also features a higher yield than many of these. For example, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI), the largest and most well-known of these ETFs, features a 7.4% yield, and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) yields 8.8%. These are both impressive yields, but SPYI\u2019s is significantly higher.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the level of SPYI\u2019s dividend payout is not set in stone, and the amount can vary from month to month. However, the payouts have been relatively consistent, ranging between $0.47 and $0.50 per month over the past year. Additionally, since its launch in August of 2022, SPYI has paid distributions every month, so it is beginning to build up a strong track record of monthly dividend payments.\n\nSPYI\u2019s Holdings\n\nSPYI offers strong diversification, with 508 holdings. Its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 38% of the fund. Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of SPYI\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nGiven the fund\u2019s strategy of investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 index, its top holdings unsurprisingly largely mirror those of the broad market index. Its holdings include household names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nSteep Expense Ratio\n\nOne negative aspect of SPYI is that it features a fairly high expense ratio of 0.68%. This means that an investor in the fund will pay $68 on a $10,000 investment over the course of the year. Assuming that the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this current expense ratio, this investor will pay $379 in fees over a five-year time horizon, a fairly steep total.\n\nThat said, this is a complex, actively-managed ETF, so it is understandable that it has a higher expense ratio than the typical index fund. As long as the ETF keeps paying out large dividends like clockwork each month, most holders will feel comfortable with the above-average expense ratio.\n\nIs SPYI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SPYI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 403 Buys, 93 Holds, and nine Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPYI stock price target of $55.24 implies 9.06% upside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Strong Option for Income Investors\n\nInvestors should be aware that investing in call options ETFs like SPYI might limit potential capital appreciation. However, with a remarkable yield of 11.6%, it\u2019s hard not to like this ETF anyway. I\u2019m bullish on SPYI as a great option for income investors based on its attractive monthly payout schedule and its massive 11.6% dividend yield. As one part of a balanced portfolio, this is an effective tool for generating frequent, above-average income on a steady basis.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Alphabet Stock Soars to New Peak. Here's Why I'm Doubling Down.",
        "body": "After a rebound year in 2023, the tech sector continued its momentum through the first half of this year. Notable tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 are up around 20% and 19%, respectively, largely due to the growth of big tech stocks.\n\nLike most stocks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has benefited from the technology's ushering into the mainstream. Alphabet's stock is up close to 32% this year and reached a new all-time high in late June.\n\nWhen stocks are flirting with peaks, many investors become hesitant, fearing a correction could be in the works. Whether that happens remains to be seen, but as a long-term investor, I'm doubling down on Alphabet, and here's why.\n\nGoogle will remain the king of search advertising\n\nAlphabet's bread and butter has been and will continue to be money earned from Google advertising. In the first quarter, Alphabet made $80.5 billion, and Google advertising accounted for over 76% of it. The good news, though, is that it's less than in previous quarters, a signal that it's becoming less reliant on it.\n\nConcerns about how new AI implementation may affect Alphabet's advertising revenue are valid but overblown. On one end, Google makes money when users click links on their search ads, so if users get their questions answered by Google's AI Overview answers, then a slowdown is possible.\n\nOn the other hand, AI inclusion also opens up new advertising opportunities with new ad formats. Google advertising is so important to Alphabet's business that you have to assume the company wouldn't overlook the effect of its AI Overview implementation.\n\nWhen you routinely have around a 90% market share in online search, you have more room to experiment and discover ways to enhance user engagement and create more targeted advertising opportunities.\n\nGOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nGoogle Cloud could be a huge growth area\n\nThe cloud computing industry is rapidly growing, and many assume AI advancements will add to the momentum. Google Cloud is still a ways behind leaders Amazon Web Services (31% market share) and Microsoft Azure (25% market share) in terms of adaptability, but the platform has turned the corner on profitability and should contribute to growing margins.\n\nCloud platforms have a lot of fixed costs, such as data center operations and other infrastructure-related expenses. This means it takes a certain scale before the platforms achieve sustainable profitability. Now that Google Cloud has seemingly crossed that threshold, it should see a financial boost from a segment that was once weighing down its margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue in the first quarter was $9.6 billion, up $2.1 billion from last year. Its operating income (profit from its core operations) had a more dramatic jump, increasing over 370% year over year. This increased efficiency helped increase Alphabet's operating margin to 32% from 25% last year.\n\nAlphabet seems to be the best value in big tech\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a phrase coined to describe seven of the world's most influential tech companies. They include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Alphabet. As they go, so does the tech sector, for the most part.\n\nAlphabet seems to be the \"cheapest\" of the bunch, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just under 28. Being the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven doesn't automatically make Alphabet cheap because those stocks are routinely priced at a premium, but Alphabet is cheaper than its average for the past decade.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis could be a great chance for investors to grab a piece of a world-class company at a fair valuation. Alphabet has strong growth prospects, so it's easy to justify its valuation for long-term investors. This growth won't happen overnight, but Alphabet's newly announced dividend should buy some patience from investors.\n\nThe quarterly dividend is $0.20, with a yield below 0.5%, so it's not necessarily a must-have for income-seeking investors. Still, initiating a dividend program at all should signal Alphabet's confidence in its financial health and ability to sustain long-term profitability.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "By Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian share markets scaled new highs on Friday as investors sized up U.S. rate cuts for September and the mood was upbeat, while the euro hit a three-week peak ahead of French elections.\n\nSterling was firm at $1.2767 as Britain's Labour Party was set for a landslide poll victory that will sweep it to power after 14 years of Conservative rule. Elsewhere, the dollar was slightly weaker and Treasury yields marginally higher in Tokyo, as trade resumed after the U.S. Independence Day holiday.\n\nJapan's Nikkei and broader Topix both nudged up to record levels, as did Taiwan's benchmark.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2% to a two-year high with Samsung's estimate of a more than 15-fold rise in second-quarter profit helping South Korea's KOSPI to a two-year peak as well.\n\nSingapore's bank and property heavy Straits Times index is up more than 3% in as many days and also struck two-year highs.\n\n\"Global liquidity remains flush and with the S&P (500) printing a ridiculous number of records these days...at some point valuations elsewhere will make a compelling enough case,\" said Vishnu Varathan, chief economist at Mizuho in Singapore.\n\nHe noted artificial intelligence demand had driven chipmaker rallies in Taiwan and South Korea, that interest-rate settings were fuelling record profits for Singapore's big banks and that a weak yen had been a tailwind for Japanese equities.\n\nJapanese household spending unexpectedly fell in May, government data showed on Friday, complicating the interest rate outlook especially as one of the factors behind the drop has been how the weak yen has curbed consumers' purchasing power.\n\nThe yen rose slightly to 160.9 per dollar. FTSE futures opened 0.3% higher on Friday and S&P 500 futures were up ever so slightly to suggest a fresh record for the cash index may be in store later in the day.\n\nJOBS IN FOCUS\n\nEmployment data in the U.S. headlines the economic calendar on Friday. A slowdown in hiring and small uptick in unemployment is forecast, which would leave open the door for U.S. rate cuts.\n\nA run of subdued data, with the U.S. ISM measure of services activity sliding to its lowest since mid-2020 earlier in the week, had markets lifting the probability of a rate cut in September to 73% and pricing 47 basis points of cuts this year.\n\nTwo-year U.S. Treasury yields rose 1.3 bps to 4.71% in the Asia morning and benchmark 10-year yields were up 2 bps to 4.37%.\n\nIn currency markets, the euro rose to $1.0817 as polls point to France's far right National Party falling short of an absolute majority at Sunday's parliamentary election runoff.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"If the polls eventually prove accurate, this would mean the more extreme policies of fiscal expansion and immigration curbs are unlikely to pass,\" said MUFG analyst Michael Wan.\n\nThe Australian dollar notched a six-month high of $0.6738 as yield spreads swung in its favour, underpinned by wagers that the next move in Aussie rates might be up given inflation is proving stubborn. [AUD/]\n\nIn commodity trade, a weaker dollar has gold on course for its largest weekly rise in a month, up 1.4% to $2,357 an ounce. Oil is its most expensive since April with Brent crude futures holding above $87 a barrel following a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude stocks, which suggest firm demand as the U.S. summer driving season gets under way.\n\nBitcoin was down 2% and trading close to a four-month low at $56,955.\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

        "title": "Huge News for Rivian Stock: Here's What Comes Next",
        "body": "Last month, we got a massive shake-up in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) -- one of the most successful EV brands besides Tesla -- inked a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen to fund future growth and build a software/technology joint venture group. Rivian stock shot up over 30% on the news and is now up 27% in the past month.\n\nThis deal is huge for Rivian. Burning a ton of cash and running out of money from its initial public offering (IPO), Rivian can utilize this funding to further scale its operations and hopefully reach positive cash flow.\n\nHere's the skinny on the deal and what comes next for the EV stock.\n\nVolkswagen deal: $5 billion capital cushion\n\nThe $5 billion deal with Volkswagen comes with multiple steps. There is an initial investment of $1 billion, and then $4 billion coming over the next two years. In addition, $2 billion of future investment will be in Rivian equity (i.e., common stock), while $2 billion from Volkswagen will contribute to the newly formed joint venture group.\n\nAt the end of Q1, Rivian had a cash balance of $7.9 billion. While this seems like a lot, the company is burning $5.6 billion a year in free cash flow. This new funding extends Rivian's timeline for achieving profitability, which will likely take multiple years, given that the brand is still subscale (it only expects to produce 57,000 vehicles this year).\n\nThe deal not only gives Rivian a cash cushion, but also a huge partner to deploy its advanced vehicle software and technology to. According to the announcement, Volkswagen is planning to deploy Rivian's electronic hardware and software systems for its future vehicles beginning in the second half of this decade. This will help Rivian further scale its operations and bring in more revenue over its fixed-cost investments, hopefully leading to operating leverage on the income statement.\n\nCan Rivian reach positive cash flow?\n\nRivian is burning a ton of cash. It lost $5.6 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months on just $5 billion in sales. Clearly, it needs to scale its EV manufacturing in order to stem this burn and eventually reach positive cash flow. Otherwise, the stock will not be worth much.\n\nAt its recent Investor Day, management stated that it can reach annual production of 150,000 vehicles on its current operations. Then, it plans to reach 215,000 with the addition of the new vehicle called the R2, and eventually another 400,000 more in capacity from future vehicles called the R3 and R3X. This would bring annual production from 57,000 today to over 600,000 within just a few years, a 10x in volume growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf/when this happens, Rivian believes it can consistently bring down its unit costs. The plan is for a 20% cost reduction for the second generation of its first vehicle, called the R1, and then a further 45% cost reduction on the R2. With gross margins of -44% today, it is imperative for the company to achieve these cost cuts. Right now, its unit economics are unsustainable.\n\nRIVN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn the near term, there are two things Rivian investors need to watch: production volume and gross margins. Both are related for a car manufacturer, and will need to improve in the coming years in order to stem the current unsustainable cash burn.\n\nOver the coming three to five years, Rivian will need to increase its deliveries to hit its planned production capacity of 600,000 vehicles. More scale along with cost cuts on a per-unit basis can help gross margins move from -45% to 25%, management's stated long-term goal.\n\nOver the long term, investors need to be tracking whether Rivian hits its long-term target of a 10% free cash flow margin. If they hit this estimate while growing production volumes by 10x, the stock will likely do well for investors who buy today. If they keep burning cash forever, the stock will not be worth much, though.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy With $1,000",
        "body": "Growth-oriented investors have experienced a bit of a roller-coaster ride over the past few years. Many companies in the \"growth stock\" category were struggling just two years ago, but in the bull market we are now experiencing, they're delivering very different results. However, investors should look beyond the near term and seek out stocks that can perform well over the long run, whether or not they are currently keeping pace with the broader market.\n\nFor those who have $1,000 to put to work in the market now, I recommend considering Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) and DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM). Here's why.\n\n1. Shopify\n\nE-commerce giant Shopify hasn't performed well this year. The company's shares are down by 15% and are changing hands for just under $64 apiece.\n\nThe company's financial results haven't been as impressive as the market wanted, and that can be especially problematic for richly valued growth stocks. Shopify's forward price-to-sales ratio stands at 9.6 -- the undervalued range is typically described as having a ratio of 2 or less.\n\nSHOP PS Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nShopify's share price could remain volatile in the short term, but there are good reasons to hold onto the stock for a long time. The e-commerce industry will be on a growth path for a long time, and management wants to ride that wave for as long as possible. Management's goal is for Shopify to become a 100-year-old company. Saying it is one thing, accomplishing it will be another. But Shopify's journey has started reasonably well.\n\nIt has become a leader in helping merchants build online storefronts. It allows them to sell and market their products across most online channels, including social media platforms. It has an app store with thousands of customization options to cater to all merchants' specific and variegated needs. In other words, it aims to provide everything businesses need to be successful, and it is, so far, doing a great job. That's why Shopify's revenue has increased rapidly in the past. The company ended 2023 with a more than 10% e-commerce market share by gross merchandise volume.\n\nIt also does business in over 175 countries. Even in the U.S., e-commerce represents only 15.9% of total retail sales. That number is lower in many other countries, which highlights the massive growth potential at Shopify's disposal. Investors can acquire 15 of the company's shares for $1,000 and have change to spare. That would be a great move.\n\n2. DexCom\n\nThe state of diabetes worldwide is concerning. The prevalence of this chronic illness has been growing for decades. Like most chronic conditions, the disease is difficult and inconvenient to manage, and hundreds of billions of dollars are spent on medical costs related to it every year. Innovative technologies that can help diabetes patients achieve better outcomes are important.\n\nStory continues\n\nDexCom offers just such a technology with its continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices that allow diabetics to keep track of their blood sugar levels throughout the day. CGMs are superior to traditional blood glucose meters (BGMs) for several reasons. Let's name just two.\n\nFirst, CGMs can automatically make measurements, even when patients are asleep. BGMs must be operated manually and only tell a patient's blood glucose level at the specific moment of a test. Second, CGMs can automatically send alerts to patients, caregivers, and medical professionals when someone's blood glucose rises too high or falls too low, something BGMs can't do. DexCom is one of the two leaders in the CGM market.\n\nIts financial results have been on a strong growth path for a while now. In the first quarter, revenue increased by 24% year over year to $921 million, and its adjusted earnings per share nearly doubled to $0.32.\n\nHow much growth potential is there in this market? Consider that DexCom ended 2023 with 2.3 million customers. That number isn't even close to 1% of the half a billion adults with diabetes worldwide. And while DexCom does not have access to many of these potential customers -- considering they live in countries where it has no presence -- the company has repeatedly pointed out that even in the U.S., it still has considerable room to grow.\n\nIts addressable market will get even larger as it enters new territories, as it has historically done. DexCom is trading for a little under $113 each as of this writing, so investors can get eight shares for $1,000.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Should You Buy the Second-Highest Yielding Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?",
        "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average contains 30 blue chip companies, almost all of which pay dividends. And while the index yields more than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, there are only two of its stocks that yield over 5%.\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is one of them, with a 6.5% yield. The other is commodity chemical company Dow (NYSE: DOW).\n\nIt has nothing to do with the \"Dow\" in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Confusion aside, here's why Dow is an excellent undervalued high-yield dividend stock.\n\nA chemical plant. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDow is in a downturn\n\nDow has four main segments: packaging, infrastructure, consumer, and mobility. No matter the segment or customer, the company's objective is to make chemicals used in plastics, seals, foams, gels, adhesives, resins, coatings, and the like for the lowest price possible.\n\nUnlike a specialty chemical company, like DuPont, or Corteva, which caters to the agriculture industry, Dow's differentiating factors are its procurement, manufacturing, and distribution -- not so much making a unique product that its competitors can't match.\n\nA disadvantage of Dow's model is that it is heavily dependent on demand and prone to downturns. It is also vulnerable to global supply chains and geopolitical risks.\n\nSales and margins surged in late 2021 and early 2022 as demand recovered from the COVID-induced slowdown. But since then, Dow's sales and operating margins have been crushed, with operating margins falling from around 15% to 5% in just two years.\n\nDOW Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDow discussed the demand dynamics for ethylene and polyethylene in detail on its first-quarter 2024 earnings call, saying that cash margins in China remain negative, pressuring suppliers. However, the company has a cost advantage, and management is confident it is beginning to turn the corner.\n\nDespite a challenging quarter, the company reiterated its guidance for achieving $6.4 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2024, which would be a substantial improvement from $4.01 billion in 2023 EBITDA.\n\nReturning to growth\n\nDow has been investing heavily in low-carbon efforts and new markets. The energy transition is a potential catalyst, including chemicals and materials to make electric vehicles, and lower-emission electric-powered cracking furnaces used in chemical production. By 2030, the company expects to grow capacity by 20%, EBITDA by over $3 billion per year, and reduce its directly and indirectly produced emissions by 15% compared to 2020 levels.\n\nIn its May investor presentation, management said that its near-term growth investments since 2021 have already added $800 million per year in incremental mid-cycle EBITDA.\n\nStory continues\n\nDow's Path2Zero hydrogen-fueled cracking plant in Alberta, Canada, is expensive but could help the company achieve its economic and environmental targets. On the first-quarter earnings call, it said that the project could deliver even higher returns than its Texas-9 cracker, which was instrumental in helping achieve record earnings in 2021.\n\nIn addition to the whims of the business cycle, it's important to understand that Dow's earnings can swing wildly based on the timing of its investments. Right now, the company is in expansion mode, and capital expenditures are their highest since Dow, DuPont, and Corteva spun off into independent companies in April 2019.\n\nThe good news is that Dow took advantage of outsize earnings by paying down debt. It has reduced its net debt and pension liability by $9 billion over the last five years, with 99% of long-term debt at fixed rates.\n\nA business built for returning capital\n\nDow has been a rather unimpressive stock. Since spinning off from DowDuPont in April 2019, the stock price has gone practically nowhere. The quarterly dividend has also stayed the same at $0.70 or $2.80 per share annually -- good for a forward yield of 5.3%.\n\nA lack of dividend raises often indicates that the payout is unaffordable. But as mentioned above, Dow is undergoing a period of capital investments that it believes will lead to more earnings growth over time.\n\nIt also has clearly stated capital-return goals, with a dividend policy that targets a 45% payout of operating net income and a 65% payout of operating net income through dividends plus share buybacks. As earnings grow over time, we can expect the dividend to also grow. For now, the 5.3% yield is a worthwhile incentive to hold the stock.\n\nLoad up on Dow stock for a reliable high yield\n\nThe investment thesis for Dow since the spinoff has centered almost entirely around the dividend. And over the short term, it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock price continue to languish. But management is making the right long-term investments to capitalize on the energy transition, while also improving its balance sheet. It is progressing well on its 2030 targets, for which investors should continue to hold it accountable.\n\nThe valuation also looks incredibly attractive. Analyst consensus estimates are for $2.95 in 2024 earnings per share and $4.18 in 2025 as the company returns to growth. Based on its 2024 earnings, Dow would have a price-to-earnings ratio under 18, which is inexpensive considering it is coming off a weak year.\n\nAll told, Dow checks a lot of boxes for income and value investors, making it a worthwhile passive-income play to consider now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dow right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dow, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dow wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "UK election brings few hopes or fears to cautious City of London By Reuters",
        "body": "By Sinead Cruise and Huw Jones\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -The UK financial sector is warming to Labour's pro-business overtures and pledges to provide stability and support, but many in the City remain wary it could be targeted to prop up Britain's stretched public finances further down the line.\n\nUnder leader Keir Starmer, the Labour Party - expected to win Thursday's UK election - has assiduously courted the City of London, mindful that his plans for boosting economic growth will need a big dose of private capital.\n\nIn the last election in 2019, Starmer's predecessor Jeremy Corbyn set out a radical manifesto to increase public investment by raising taxes on companies and top earners, resulting in Labour's worst result since the 1930s.\n\n\"The most important change is that there has been a big shift in mindset by Labour towards the City in the past few years,\" William Wright, managing director of think-tank New Financial told Reuters.\n\n\"That is reflected in a strong sense of continuity in the reforms to capital markets and pensions underway,\" Wright said.\n\nLabour, whose Rachel Reeves, a former economist at the Bank of England, is expected to become Britain's finance minister, has backed the Conservative government's post-Brexit 'Edinburgh Reforms' aimed at protecting the City's global competitiveness.\n\nThe party has also promised a review of the pensions and savings industry, which could help Britain's capital markets as well as boosting the financial resilience of the population.\n\nBut there is also speculation about changes to how capital gains and wealth are taxed, as well as Reeves' plans to change the way private equity is taxed, which would likely hit hard.\n\nMichael Moore, chief executive of BVCA, a private equity industry body, said Labour was, however, showing willingness to back up its \"pro-business mood music with engagement on substance\".\n\nReeves had vowed to end a \"loophole\" that allows a portion of private equity earnings to be taxed as capital gains, rather than at the higher income tax rate, but last month signalled to the Financial Times that favourable tax treatment would continue in instances where fund managers put their own capital at risk.\n\nSANGUINE AFTER BREXIT AND TRUSS\n\nMany of Britain's top bankers and financiers are taking the prospect of a left-leaning Labour government in their stride after the hit from Brexit, and the impact on the UK government bond market in September 2022 from then-Prime Minister Liz Truss's plans for unfunded tax cuts.\n\n\"The industry has had positive and constructive conversations with Labour since 2019. If they win, very few new governments will have entered office better briefed on what our ecosystem needs to help act as a dynamo for growth and competitiveness,\" said Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, which represents the UK financial sector globally.\n\nThe Labour Party did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFixing the damage to investor confidence and leakage of financial services activities to the EU caused by Brexit - arguably the most enduring legacy of the Conservative Party's 14 years in power - will be tough for Labour to fix.\n\nFrance's central bank said last year transactions between French-based financial services firms and the rest of the world hit a record 10.4 billion euros in 2022 - double the volume seen at the time of the 2016 Brexit vote.\n\nAccording to figures published by CityUK in January, the UK had a 16% share of cross-border bank lending in 2016 but this fell to 14% by end Q2 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Amsterdam has overtaken London to become Europe's top share trading venue since euro-denominated share trading by EU investors had to stop in Britain on Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nSEEKING CERTAINTY AND STABILITY\n\nStarmer has repeatedly made clear that rejoining the single market, essential for the City to regain direct access to the EU, is a red line he won't cross.\n\nMany market participants just want to see financial sector reforms already agreed properly implemented under Labour, to protect the industry's massive contribution to state coffers.\n\nA study by PwC for the City of London Corporation and TheCityUK published in May estimated the total tax contribution of the financial and related professional services industry was 110.2 billion pounds ($140 billion) in 2023.\n\nThis is equivalent to 12.3% of total UK tax receipts, more than the UK government's education budget, or more than half the health budget.\n\nImminent changes to Britain's rules on stock market listings have been designed to bring in more big-ticket initial public offerings, which could potentially include China-founded fast-fashion retailer Shein, and other similar deals that bring handsome paydays for those involved.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority is set to publish its listings revamp after the election, which could spur a flurry of corporate activity from end-July.\n\nBritain's economy pulled out of recession at a faster pace than previously thought in the first three months of this year, but the broader economic backdrop remains fragile.\n\nUK public debt is high, nearly equivalent to GDP, with prospects of tepid growth, leaving analysts to conclude that taxes will inevitably rise to shore up health and other services, making the financial sector a potential target.\n\n\"It's pretty simple really, business wants certainty,\" said Naresh Aggarwal, associate policy & technical director at the Association of Corporate Treasurers.\n\nM&G Investments said in a note to clients that a Labour election was unlikely to fundamentally alter the direction of the UK equity market where valuations are depressed compared with Wall Street.\n\nBut New Financial's Wright cautioned that Labour may be more radical in government than it has been in opposition, a view echoed by Samuel Gregg of the American Institute for Economic Research.\n\n\"The City should recognise Labour is a more left-leaning outfit these days than it was in Tony Blair's heyday,\" said Gregg, speaking of the New Labour stronghold of the early 2000s.\n\n\"That cannot help but make life more uncertain for the City under a Labour government with a huge majority.\"\n\n($1 = 0.7844 pounds)",
        "summary": "\"That is reflected in a strong sense of continuity in the reforms to capital markets and pensions underway,\" Wright said.\nThe party has also promised a review of the pensions and savings industry, which could help Britain's capital markets as well as boosting the financial resilience of the population.\nMany market participants just want to see financial sector reforms already agreed properly implemented under Labour, to protect the industry's massive contribution to state coffers.\nThis is equivalent to 12.3% of total UK tax receipts, more than the UK government's education budget, or more than half the health budget.\n\"That cannot help but make life more uncertain for the City under a Labour government with a huge majority.\"",

        "body": "By Amanda Cooper\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -The pound held firm on Friday after Keir Starmer's centre-left Labour Party was expected to win a huge majority in the UK general election, affording investors some much-needed certainty after years of market volatility under the Conservatives.\n\nAs of 0430 GMT on Friday, many results were still to be announced from Thursday's vote, but Labour had won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament, with an exit poll suggesting it would capture about 410, and Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had conceded defeat.\n\nSterling firmed slightly after the release of the exit polls, and was last trading around $1.2772. The pound was broadly unchanged against the euro, which was at 84.76 pence. Futures linked to the stock index were up.\n\n\"The stability that would be provided by such a win would mean investors can cross 'UK political risk' off their list of worries for the time being,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.\n\nSterling has edged up since Sunak called the election in late May, earlier than anticipated. It is the strongest-performing major currency against the dollar this year, with a gain of 1.2%.\n\nOn a trade-weighted basis, the pound is now back where it was in 2016, at the time of the Brexit vote, reflecting a belief among traders and investors that a period of intense market volatility, driven by political and economic tumult under the Conservatives, may be drawing to a close.\n\n\"It's a breath of fresh air to be running (UK) equities in a market where the election is seen as non-event,\" said Laura Foll, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\n\"I'm hoping we're going back to an era where boring is good and politics treads lighter in people's lives,\" she said, adding: \"It will be a more gradual lifting (of confidence).\"\n\nEchoing this sense of calm in the run-up to the election, the premium that investors demand for the extra risk of holding gilts rather than top-rated German 10-year bonds has remained stable this year around 160 basis points - a far cry from the 230 bps seen during a mini-budget crisis in 2022.\n\nFutures on the FTSE 100 were 0.2% higher on Friday in Asia, as results from the UK election trickled in.\n\nUK stocks have hit record highs this year, buoyed by a slow-growing but comparatively stable economy and decelerating inflation.\n\nTRUSS DEJA VU\n\nHowever, the memory of the market chaos triggered by former Prime minister Liz Truss' \"mini budget\" of September 2022 is still relatively fresh in investors' minds and Britain's stretched finances will give any new government little leeway to increase spending.\n\nSo preserving investor trust while tackling numerous economic challenges will be paramount.\n\n\"There is a lot of spending that (Labour) have pledged as well and only 20 billion pounds' worth of fiscal headroom - give or take - so how those books are going to be balanced is a key question,\" Pepperstone senior research analyst Michael Brown said.\n\n\"And this plan for 2.5% annual GDP growth is punchy, if I'm being kind, fanciful if I'm being slightly less kind and if we don't get that growth relatively quickly, you could be looking at a pretty significant fiscal tightening going on,\" he added.\n\nBritain has suffered from the highest inflation and some of the highest interest rates in the developed world in the last couple of years.\n\nUK 10-year government bond yields have risen this year to around 4.2%, as investors have sold debt based on their assumption that British interest rates will take longer to fall than many had previously anticipated.\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to lower interest rates when it meets in August. Investors are likely to quickly look beyond the results of Thursday's election and towards monetary policy, analysts said.\n\n\"What's going to be really interesting is there isn't actually that much headroom for dramatic change in fiscal policy,\" City Index senior markets strategist Fiona Cincotta said.\n\n\"So I don't think there is anything that is going to massively move the market as far as these elections are concerned now until the Autumn Statement, so the focus is going to shift, probably pretty quickly, back to the Bank of England,\" she said.",

Before the hearing began, he had nodded and waved to friends and supporters.\n\nThe marathon case has prompted criticism from countries such as Australia, Britain, and the United States, which say national security laws have been used to curb freedoms guaranteed when Britain handed the Asian financial hub back to China in 1997.\n\nThe governments of China and Hong Kong say the law is necessary and has brought stability, however.\n\nThe mitigation hearings began a month after 14 activists were found guilty, with two acquittals, in May. They had pleaded not guilty. Wong and 30 others had pleaded guilty, and four of them have become prosecution witnesses.\n\nWong is among the third batch of the convicted 45 making mitigation pleas for a lighter sentence. He did not himself write a mitigation letter, but his mother, classmates in church and former school teachers wrote on his behalf.\n\nA candidate who won the unofficial primary poll, Wong was disqualified from running in the 2020 election, which the government postponed on the grounds of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAn admitted summary of facts, Wong told the election forum that he lobbied internationally, in Britain, the United States and the United Nations since 2016, for measures such as the U.S. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passed in 2019.\n\nHis lawyer said 2016 was well before the national security law and his appeal for such foreign support was not specific to the current conspiracy, forming instead part of the broader democracy movement.\n\nWong and most of the activists have been denied bail and remanded in custody for more than three years in what critics say has been a departure from common law traditions.",

But for now, at least, policymakers may proceed against a backdrop of market calm.\n\nThe euro was making itself comfortable, too, in anticipation of France's far right National Rally falling short of an absolute majority at Sunday's parliamentary runoff - though the week's 1% gain may be vulnerable to surprises.\n\nLater in the session, which is thinned as many traders make a long weekend of Thursday's Independence Day holiday, U.S. jobs data is expected to show a slight cooling in the labour market.

        "body": "By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics estimated on Friday a more than 15-fold rise in its second-quarter operating profit, as rebounding semiconductor prices driven by the artificial intelligence boom lifted earnings from a low base a year ago.\n\nThe world's largest memory chip, smartphone and TV maker estimated its operating profit rose to 10.4 trillion won ($7.54 billion) in the quarter ended June 30, from 670 billion won a year earlier.\n\nThe profit beat a 8.8 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate, and the quarter was its most profitable since the third quarter of 2022.\n\nIn addition to higher chip prices, the better-than-expected profit likely reflected Samsung (KS: ) reversing its previous inventory writedowns on its books, as the value of its chip inventory has rebounded in accounting terms, analysts said.\n\nRevenue likely rose 23% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier to 74 trillion won, Samsung said.\n\nSamsung shares opened up 1.2% after the guidance, versus a 0.4% rise in the wider market.\n\nThe company is due to release detailed second-quarter earnings on July 31.\n\nAI DEMAND\n\nSamsung's key semiconductor division likely posted its second consecutive quarterly profit, improving on the first quarter, as memory chip prices keep rising from a mid-2022 to end-2023 trough that was caused by weak post-pandemic demand for gadgets that use the chips.\n\nExplosive demand for high-end DRAM chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI chipsets, as well as chips used in data centre servers and gadgets that run AI services have helped buoy chip prices, analysts said.\n\nDuring the second quarter, memory chip prices jumped by about 13% to 18% versus the previous quarter for DRAM chips used in tech devices and 15% to 20% for NAND Flash chips used for data storage, according to data provider TrendForce.\n\nBut the climb in memory chip prices may slow in third quarter, with TrendForce forecasting a 5% to 10% price hike for both conventional DRAM and NAND Flash chips, as demand for older, legacy chips from the consumer electronics market remains lacklustre.\n\n\"At the earnings call at the end of the month, we will be interested in Samsung's outlook on legacy chips, which will be a sign for whether this chip industry recovery can last into next year,\" said Ko Yeongmin, an analyst at Daol Investment & Securities.\n\nAI-driven demand for high-end chips such as HBM and solid-state drives (SSDs) will outperform the rest of the market, analysts said, though Samsung has been lagging behind South Korean rival SK Hynix in the supply of high-end HBM chips to customers like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).\n\nU.S. memory chip rival Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) beat estimates for its latest quarterly revenue last week driven by a demand surge from the AI industry, although its current-quarter forecast disappointed investors who had been even more upbeat.\n\nInvestors are awaiting news of whether Samsung's latest fourth-generation HBM chips will receive approval to supply Nvidia after they failed earlier tests due heat and power consumption problems, according to sources.\n\nSamsung in May replaced the chief of its semiconductor division in a bid to overcome what it called a \"chip crisis\".\n\nShares in Samsung were up 8% year-to-date as of Thursday, compared to SK Hynix shares' 63% rise.\n\n($1 = 1,379.8700 won)",

It has said it does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war - with U.S. tariffs on its goods continuing to sting - but that it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms.\n\nThere is a four-month window during which the EV tariffs are provisional and intensive talks are expected to continue between the two sides as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nSince January, Beijing has opened tit-for-tat investigations into European brandy and pork imports, striking at predominantly French, Spanish, Dutch and Danish commercial interests as the 27-strong bloc wavers over whether to back the Commission in an upcoming advisory vote on the EV tariffs.\n\nThe state-backed Global Times newspaper has also reported that officials are considering opening an anti-subsidy probe into European dairy imports and imposing tariffs on large-engined petrol cars manufactured in Europe.\n\nAuthorities have previously dropped hints about what they might do next through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures.\n\nAnalysts say China chose brandy and pork to persuade France and Spain, who have been among the firmest backers of EU curbs, to join the likes of Germany, whose automakers made a third of their sales last year in China and reportedly wants to lobby the Commission to stop the tariffs.\n\nAfter the bloc confirmed the provisional tariffs would take effect from Friday, the Global Times published an article calling on the EU to \"show sincerity\" in negotiations over the EV curbs and a separate editorial urging Brussels to consider European automakers' opposition to the curbs.\n\nThe Global Times also called attention to American EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s manufacturing plant in Shanghai, broadening its call to protest against the tariffs.\n\nChinese EV makers' Hong Kong-listed shares fell on Friday, led by Geely Automobile, which dropped 4.1% to HK$8.34, its lowest since March 7.\n\nGeely Automobile's unlisted parent, Geely, faces additional duties of 19.9%, on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.\n\nChinese brands MG and NIO suggested on Thursday they might raise prices in Europe later this year, in response to the curbs.",

India's auto industry forms 7% of the country's GDP, as per government data.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nThe intense heat in northern India has reduced footfall at dealerships and led to fewer people buying cars, according to analysts.\n\nThis especially hurt small cars and electric vehicles.\n\nSubdued retail demand also led to muted wholesales for some carmakers, according to analysts. Tata Motors (NYSE: ) attributed the drop to the impact of the Indian elections, in addition to the weather.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra also posted weaker-than-expected overall June wholesale growth.\n\nAnalysts said concerns around how the government's policies could affect peoples' income might discourage consumers from buying vehicles and hurt automakers' sales to dealerships.\n\nStill, the SUV portfolios of companies, including Maruti Suzuki, benefitted from strong demand, extending the record-high sales seen in the financial year 2024.\n\nKEY QUOTES\n\n\"Despite improved product availability and substantial discounts aimed at stimulating demand, market sentiment remains subdued due to extreme heat resulting in 15% less walk-ins.

(NFP) are expected to have declined to 190,000 in June. The unemployment rate is projected to remain at 4.0%.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the interest of financial market participants has increasingly shifted towards data on the US labor market, which has a great impact on the exchange rate of the dollar.\n\nIn the previous month, the dollar index rose to 105.85 points.\n\nOn the 5th of July, the US Labor Department is due to submit another report on the number of people employed in the non-agricultural sector. According to experts' expectations, the number of people employed will decrease to 190,000 in June, despite the fact that in May this figure was at the level of 272,000. Meanwhile, according to forecasts, the unemployment rate will remain stable at 4.0%. The US Federal Reserve is already receiving positive signals to reduce inflation, and unemployment data combined with NFP may strengthen sentiment in the direction of lowering the interest rate in the coming months. As a result, a change in the interest rate will have a strong impact on the entire financial market and investor sentiment. On Tuesday, the data showed an increase of 221,000 from the previous month to 8.140 million in May 2024, exceeding expectations. This data provides a positive signal for a potential reduction in unemployment. Average hourly earnings for all employees on US private nonfarm payrolls increased by 14 cents, or 0.4%, to $34.91 in May 2024.\n\nThe US unemployment rate reached a two-year high, hitting 4.0% in May 2024, the lowest level in more than two years. Analysts believe that the unemployment rate in June will remain at the May level of 4.0%.\n\n\"The increase in job openings could help address the rising unemployment issue and, consequently, inflation,\" said Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa. \"The rise in unemployment amid increasing job openings indicates that the available jobs do not meet the population's expectations. Thus, the labor market is experiencing a cooling,\" he added.\n\nOver the past month, the increased by 1.17% to 105.85 points. If the support level of 104 points is breached, further decline in the US Dollar Index to 101.9 points can be expected.

The closely watched PMI indicator for the non-manufacturing sector fell more than expected in June, hitting the lowest level since May 2020. The employment subindex fell further below 50.0, while the prices paid component moderated to 56.3.\n\nThe data comes on the back of a similarly weak reading of the on Monday.

Yet, FOMC members agreed that \u201cgreater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2%\u201d was needed before cutting rates, according to the minutes of the June meeting published yesterday.\n\nThe remarks from the latest Fedspeak suggest policymakers\u2019 stance hasn\u2019t changed much since that meeting. Nevertheless, there has been a slight dovish lean, particularly from when he spoke on Tuesday, and all this has bolstered expectations that the Fed will start its easing campaign in September, with the odds rising to more than 75%.\n\nSome Relief for the Yen as Dollar Slips\n\nEverything seems to be falling into place for the Fed to make its dovish pivot either at the July meeting or at Jackson Hole. Of course, tomorrow\u2019s jobs report could still spoil things if the headline payrolls figure surprises to the upside again. But ahead of that, Treasury yields have taken quite a tumble, reversing some of the gains since the end of last week that came on the back of the increasing likelihood of a second Trump presidency.\n\nWith the US bond market closed on Thursday for Independence Day, the is stuck on the backfoot near three-week lows.

Investors are also hoping that a Labor government will forge better ties with the EU and are ignoring, for now, the possible risks of the UK turning into a one-party state should the Conservatives end up with less than 100 seats.\n\nIt's Not All Good News for Risk Assets\n\nIn equity markets, both the and finished at fresh all-time highs on Wednesday, lifting European shares higher today.

        "title": "Gold, Euro Rise on Soft US Economic Data",
        "body": "Gold Rose by Over 1% on Soft US Economic Data\n\nYesterday, broke above the resistance level of 2,340 and gained 1.14% as news and US reports bolstered investor hopes for an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\nUS economic data released on Wednesday, particularly the weak report on services and employment, showed a slowdown. Additionally, a report on for the last week showed an increase, supporting the view that the labor market is gradually cooling. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits rose further to a 2-year high by the end of June.\n\nThe ISM Services Purchase Manager's Index (PMI) data released yesterday was softer than expected, further fueling investors' hopes for rate cuts by the US central bank. The main focus is now on tomorrow's (NFP) report. The lower-than-expected NFP data could prompt the Fed to start lowering rates.\n\nAfter the release of the latest economic data, markets are now pricing in a 74% chance of the Fed cutting interest rates in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. \u2018The level of interest rates that's neutral in its impact on the economy likely hasn't risen much\u2019, said New York Fed President John Williams.\n\nAccording to Reuters, \"Fed officials at their last meeting acknowledged that the US economy appeared to be slowing but still counseled a wait-and-see approach before committing to rate cuts, according to minutes from the June 11\u201312 session\".\n\nToday, a quiet and calm market is expected ahead of tomorrow's increased volatility during the release of NFP data at 12:30 p.m. UTC. Today is Independence Day in the US, and the market will be closed. Thus, strong movements are not expected during the holiday. XAU/USD may slightly correct downwards after yesterday's growth towards around 2,350.\n\nEuro Jumps Higher on Rising Hopes for US Rate Cuts\n\nThe (EUR) gained 0.39% on Wednesday after US macroeconomic reports were weaker than expected, increasing the probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivering two rate cuts this year.\n\nYesterday, US ADP Employment, Jobless Claims, and ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reports revealed that the US economy was slowing. Specifically, the employment report showed that only 150,000 new jobs were created in June instead of the expected 160,000. The data suggests that the closely-watched Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report due this Friday may also indicate emerging weakness in the labor market. Furthermore, ISM Services PMI dropped to a four-year low, hinting at the US economy slowing at the end of Q2.\n\n\"All of this creates mood music that is conducive to a modest easing in the degree of restraint in monetary policy later in the year, and we still expect two quarter-point cuts in September and December\", said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.\n\nIndeed, the latest interest rate swap market data implies roughly 48 basis points worth of cuts by the Fed in 2024. Meanwhile, according to official messages, the (ECB) monetary policy may not be as dovish as previously expected. On Wednesday, Slovenian central bank chief Bostjan Vasle urged the ECB to wait before lowering interest rates again, highlighting potential risks that could disrupt the eurozone's disinflationary trend.\n\nEUR/USD was falling slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The US financial market will be closed today due to Independence Day, so the American trading session will likely be quiet. However, volatility may increase during the late European session, as traders will be repositioning before Friday. The technical bias in EUR/USD remains bullish as the pair moves above the important intraday level of 1.07700.\n\nThe US Dollar Slides on Soft Data, Boosting the Canadian Dollar\n\nThe (CAD) gained 0.28% on Wednesday after softer-than-expected US economic data increased the chances of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) this year.\n\nUSD/CAD hit a one-month low yesterday as weaker-than-expected US statistics surprised investors. All three reports\u2014ADP Employment, Jobless Claims, and ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)\u2014indicated that the economy was slowing at an accelerating rate, meaning that the Fed is now more likely to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut this autumn. Indeed, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, investors have a 74% probability that the regulator will ease its monetary policy on September 18.\n\n\"The economic data surprises in the US are now undershooting expectations relative to other major economies, which has generally coincided with periods of dollar weakness\", wrote Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.\n\nAt the same time, the Canadian dollar received an additional boost from rising oil prices after a larger-than-expected decline in US crude stocks offset traders' concerns about rising global inventories. is one of Canada's key export items, so its price negatively correlates with USD/CAD. Still, the latest strength in the Canadian dollar was mostly caused by the greenback's weakness.\n\n\"It is more of a US story than a Canadian one\", said Tony Valente, senior FX dealer at AscendantFX.\n\nIn the long term, the market expects the Canadian dollar to strengthen. According to the latest Reuters poll, investors believe that CAD will likely rise over the coming year as the US election creates a lot of uncertainty.\n\nUSD/CAD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The US financial market will be closed today due to Independence Day, so the American trading session will likely be quiet. However, volatility may increase during the late European session as traders will reposition ahead of Friday, featuring two important news releases. Apart from the headline US Nonfarm Payroll report, CAD traders should also monitor the Canadian Employment report. The data may significantly impact the Bank of Canada's monetary policy outlook.",

        "body": "We are forcefully entering a period of \u2018bad news is good news\u2019 as the Federal Reserve (Fed) moves toward its first rate cut. We don\u2019t know when the Fed will cut the rates \u2013 the Fed members themselves can\u2019t tell you that without more evidence of slowing economy and easing inflation as printed by yesterday\u2019s Fed minutes \u2013 but we know that the weaker the data the closer the first rate cut.\n\nYesterday soft data from the US fueled the Fed doves yesterday. The latest ADP report showed that the US economy added 150\u2019000 new private jobs in June, less than expected by analysts and slightly less than last month, initial jobless claims rose, the factory orders unexpectedly fell in May and the ISM services unexpectedly contracted in June, the employment component plunged while prices fell more than expected.\n\nAs such, investors saw in the data the evidence that the Fed is looking for to cut its rates. The tipped a toe below the 4.70% but bounced back to this level before the July 4th holiday, the dropped to 4.35% while the slipped below its June ascending channel base and tested the 50-DMA to the downside. The and advanced to a fresh record yesterday.\n\nThe US stock rally continues to be shouldered by the technology sector, the others remain timidly upbeat, a lower rate environment should broaden the rally to other sectors but other sectors could hardly print the same amplitude of gains than the tech. If the heftily-valued tech tumbles, the rest of the market will suffer.\n\nTime to Say Goodbye?\n\nBrits are heading to the polls today aiming to oust the Conservatives from power after 14 years. Labour is walking into this election with more than 20 points advance over the Tories \u2013 even the most Conservative parts of the country seem tired of a 14-year Tory rule. The two most likely scenarios are a good Labour majority with 150 seats \u2013 which is almost double Boris Johnson\u2019s 80-seat majority in 2019 - or a supermajority.\n\nBoth will give the Labour a very large margin to pass whatever reforms they want to pass in the coming years. Normally, investors prefer Conservatives as they have a better grip on spending and debt levels. But this time, even investors want to see Labour take over the reins. For Wall Street, a Labour win is positive for both the UK stocks and . Small and medium-sized British stocks will likely benefit more from a Labour win than the \u2013 which is mostly exposed to global market conditions.\n\nCable rallied to 1.2772 yesterday and is consolidating gains near 1.2740 at the time of writing. Combined with a soft , we could see the end of the Tory rule support the pound and back a move toward 1.30. Yet once the election vibes are over, eyes will turn to the Bank of England (BoE) rate cut bets, and the latter could eventually limit the pound\u2019s upside potential, but not the stocks\u2019.\n\nOn this side of the Channel, the broad-based dollar weakness sent the past the 1.0750 resistance yesterday, the pair tested shortly traded past the 1.08 level, but the French political risks prevail and visibility is low into the second election weekend in France where we just don\u2019t know whether Le Pen will or will not win a parliamentary majority. Investors wish for a hung government that would prevent Le Pen\u2019s National Rally from exploding debt, hence keep the borrowing costs and the yield spread with Germany at acceptable levels and avoid a Liz Truss like market reaction.\n\nYet a hung government is not an outright positive scenario for France as it will prevent politicians from making any important move for years without changing the fact that these latest elections have been a massive win for Marine Le Pen. But a hung government will certainly trigger a relief rally both in the French stocks and the euro next week, while a Le Pen victory \u2013 which is not the base case scenario as per the market pricing \u2013 would dampen the mood from Monday.\n\nFar from these jitters, the Japanese is up for the third consecutive session and is approaching an ATH level reached back in March. The doesn\u2019t dare to move above the 162 for now. A broad based dollar weakness helps keeping the pressure contained; Japanese policymakers would be as happy as any investor and mortgage holder to see the Fed move closer to the first rate cut.",

Although he said more evidence was needed to rationalize cutting interest rates, his overall message favored that policy easing is on the near-term horizon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress and in bringing inflation back down to our target,\u201d Powell advised at a central banking forum in Portugal. \u201cThe last [inflation] reading and the one before it to a lesser extent, suggest that we are getting back on the disinflationary path. We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cprogress\u201d includes Friday\u2019s news that the reading of Fed\u2019s preferred measure eased in year-over-year terms in May to 2.6% \u2014 its softest pace in more than three years, based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index. Reaching the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target, in other words, appears to be on the near-term horizon.\n\nThe policy-sensitive continues to trade in a tight range, ending yesterday\u2019s session (June 2) at 4.75%. But that\u2019s well below the ~5% mark that was briefly reached in April, which suggests that investor sentiment remains moderately confident that the Fed will soon cut its current 5.25%-to-5.50% target rate.\n\nThe Fed funds futures market is pricing in a moderate probability that the central bank will soon begin easing policy, perhaps as early as the Sep. 18 FOMC meeting. The current estimate reflects a roughly 65% probability that the central bank will announce a rate cut in two months.\n\nThe timing of the rate cuts is a key factor, Powell noted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware that if we go too soon, that we can undo the good work we\u2019ve done. If we do it too late, we could unnecessarily undermine the recovery and the expansion.\u201d\n\nThe next update on inflation that will test whether disinflationary progress is continuing arrives on July 11, with the release of consumer prices for June.",

        "title": "De-Dollarization: A Far-Fetched Reality?",
        "body": "In recent years, the financial world has increasingly been marked by discussions surrounding \"de-dollarization.\" This term denotes the strategic efforts by various nations to diminish their reliance on the US dollar for international trade and financial transactions. With rising geopolitical tensions and the emergence of alternative economic blocs, understanding the implications and realities of de-dollarization is paramount for professional traders and investors.\n\nThis article explores the rise of de-dollarization, its impacts on currency and commodity markets, and potential future scenarios.\n\n\n\nDrivers of De-dollarization\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not new, de-dollarization has gained momentum due to several geopolitical and economic factors. Historically, the US dollar's dominance started with the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944, which established the dollar as the primary reserve currency of the world, backed by gold. Despite the system collapsing in the early 1970s, the dollar kept its dominance because of the stability and size of the US economy, its geopolitical influence, and the extensive market for US debt.\n\n\n\nOne of the primary motivations behind de-dollarization is the geopolitical leverage that the United States wields through its control of the global financial system. The US has frequently used economic sanctions as a tool of foreign policy, targeting countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. These sanctions are facilitated by the dollar\u2019s dominance in international finance, which forces targeted nations to seek ways to minimize their exposure to the US financial system. The freezing of Russia's foreign exchange reserves, valued at approximately $300 billion, following its invasion of Ukraine further underscores the risks associated with dollar dependence.\n\nEmerging economies and regional powers are exploring ways to strengthen their currencies and financial systems. The BRICS nations, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, have been discussing a new reserve currency to reduce their reliance on the dollar. In July 2023, Bolivia joined Brazil and Argentina in using the Chinese to pay for imports and exports. Additionally, by March 2024, 52.9% of China's international settlements were conducted in renminbi, a significant increase from less than 1% in 2010.\n\nBrazil and Argentina are at the forefront of de-dollarization in Latin America. They are discussing the creation of a common currency for bilateral trade to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Brazil's trade with other BRICS nations increased dramatically, from $48 billion in 2009 to $178 billion in 2022, showing a 370% growth.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, ASEAN countries are making significant strides towards de-dollarization. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Thailand have agreed to develop a cross-border digital payment system to facilitate local currency trade. As of 2024, Indonesian President Joko Widodo has urged using locally issued credit cards to avoid foreign payment systems, furthering efforts to protect against geopolitical disruptions\u200b\u200b. Malaysia is advancing its de-dollarization agenda by proposing the creation of an Asian Monetary Fund. In 2024, Malaysia's central bank is developing mechanisms to enable trade with China using the Malaysian ringgit instead of the US dollar.\n\nSeveral African nations, including Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Africa, actively engage in de-dollarization through their involvement with the BRICS bloc. The BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) is issuing loans in local currencies to help member nations avoid the risks associated with dollar-denominated financing. As of 2024, the BRICS countries collectively account for around 24% of the global GDP and 16% of global trade. The NDB aims to provide 30% of its loans in local currencies, promoting economic stability among developing nations\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nAnother example of a gradual shift towards regional currencies in bilateral trade is the recent agreement between India and the United Arab Emirates to use the Indian rupee for non-oil commodity trading, moving away from the dollar. the shift.\n\nDe-dollarization is spreading across the globe as more nations adopt local currencies for international trade, diminishing the US dollar's hegemony. Driven by geopolitical maneuvers and economic strategies to reduce dollar dependency, this shift is reshaping international finance. Despite these shifts, however, there are doubts whether these trends will have a decisive impact on dollar dominance. Let's examine how this move towards de-dollarization impacts the USD's role in the global economy.\n\n\n\nCurrent State of Dedollarization\n\n\n\nAs of 2024, the de-dollarization trend is progressively evident in various global economic patterns, though the US dollar retains a robust position in the international financial system. Despite a diversifying landscape, the dollar still accounts for about 69% of global currency usage and approximately 60% of disclosed foreign currency reserves worldwide\u200b\u200b.\n\n\n\nWorld - Allocated Reserves by Currency for 2023Q4, Source: IMF\n\nDe-dollarization profoundly affects the global economic landscape, significantly impacting currency and commodity markets. For instance, the share of the US dollar in global foreign exchange reserves has decreased to a historic low of 58%, a notable drop from 61% in 2022. This trend is driven by central banks diversifying their reserves into other currencies and assets, like the euro, which has increased its share to 21%. Furthermore, gold reserves have grown substantially, with central banks purchasing more gold in 2023 than in any previous year since records began in 1950, making up around 4.9% of China's foreign reserves.\n\nRegarding currency transactions, the US dollar continues to dominate, accounting for 88% of daily transactions. However, the Chinese renminbi's (RMB) share has been growing steadily, reaching 7% of global currency transactions in early 2024, up from less than 1% a decade ago. This increase is supported by China's efforts to internationalize the RMB by establishing global clearing centers and numerous currency swap agreements. Additionally, countries are increasingly conducting bilateral trade in their local currencies to reduce dependence on the US dollar. For example, Brazil and Argentina now trade with China using the RMB, and as of March 2024, 52.9% of China's international settlements were conducted in RMB, surpassing the dollar for the first time. Russia has also significantly increased its use of the yuan for oil and other commodity transactions, with 65% of its trade with China now settled in yuan.\n\nDe-dollarization is influencing financial markets and investment strategies globally. A shift away from the dollar poses risks to US financial assets. Analysts from Morgan Stanley warn that de-dollarization could lead to a depreciation of US stocks, which the dollar's strength and liquidity have supported. A weaker dollar could increase import prices and inflation, potentially undermining investor confidence. On the other hand, de-dollarization could alleviate the burden of dollar-denominated debt for emerging markets. Countries like Turkey and Argentina, which have faced economic crises due partly to their dollar liabilities, could benefit from reduced dollar dependence.\n\nThe impacts of de-dollarization are also evident in commodity markets, particularly in the trading of oil and gold! Oil\n\nThe petrodollar system, initiated in 1974, effectively ended in June 2024. This system was a pivotal economic arrangement that mandated the sale of oil in US dollars, thus entrenching the dollar as the dominant global reserve currency. For decades, this setup facilitated a substantial demand for the dollar because countries had to convert their local currencies into dollars to buy oil, the world\u2019s most traded commodity.\n\nThe agreement's termination means that oil-exporting countries are no longer obligated to conduct their transactions in US dollars. Saudi Arabia, for example, has shifted to pricing and selling its oil in Saudi riyals. This move will cascade global oil trade dynamics, influencing other nations' currency reserves and trading practices. India and China, two of the largest oil importers, need to hold higher reserves of Saudi riyals to maintain their energy supplies.\n\nThis shift could significantly reduce the global demand for the US dollar in oil transactions, which previously accounted for an estimated $1.7 trillion annually or about 20% of all US dollar-denominated trade worldwide. Gold\n\nAmidst a notable de-dollarization trend, central banks globally are increasingly purchasing gold to diversify away from the US dollar, driven by geopolitical tensions and the desire to mitigate financial risks. In 2022, central banks acquired a record 1,136 metric tons of gold, and in the first half of 2023 alone, they added 387 metric tons to their reserves, with China leading these purchases as part of its strategy to minimize reliance on the dollar\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. This movement towards gold is also bolstered by concerns over potential asset freezes, prompting 41% of surveyed central banks and sovereign funds to anticipate increasing their gold holdings in the coming years\u200b\u200b. Analysts predict that gold prices could range from $3,000 per troy ounce by the end of 2024, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainties and sustained demand from central banks\u200b\u200b.\n\n\n\nIs De-dollarization a Reality?\n\n\n\nThe debate over de-dollarization often oscillates between viewing it as an imminent reality or dismissing it as a persistent myth. Based on the latest data and expert analysis as of June 2024, here are several potential scenarios and possibilities regarding the future of de-dollarization.\n\n\n\nScenario 1: Gradual Decline of Dollar Dominance\n\n\n\nThe most likely scenario is a gradual decline in the US dollar's dominance rather than a sudden collapse.\n\n\u25cf Steady Diversification : Central banks worldwide continue diversifying their reserves away from the US dollar. The dollar's share of global reserves has fallen from 59% in 2021 to 58% in 2023. This decline indicates a steady shift towards other currencies, such as the euro, which now holds 21% of reserves, and the yuan.\n\n\u25cf Increased Use of Other Currencies : The renminbi's role in global finance gradually increases. China's international settlements in RMB have surpassed those in USD for the first time, with 52.9% of transactions settled in RMB as of March 2024, compared to 42.8% in USD. Additionally, bilateral trade agreements bypassing the dollar are becoming more common, such as the agreements between Brazil and China.\n\n\n\nScenario 2: Sudden Geopolitical Shifts\n\n\n\nA more dramatic scenario involves sudden geopolitical events that could accelerate de-dollarization.\n\n\u25cf Geopolitical Tensions : Significant geopolitical events, such as escalated tensions between the US and major global players like China and Russia, could hasten de-dollarization efforts. For instance, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has increased the use of non-dollar currencies for Russian trade, particularly with China. Over the past year, most of China's oil imports from Russia have been denominated in yuan.\n\n\u25cf Sanctions and Economic Policies : The US use of financial sanctions has driven some countries to seek alternatives to the dollar to mitigate the risk of economic isolation. Russia's move to eliminate the US dollar from its National Wealth Fund is a case in point, reducing its vulnerability to Western sanctions.\n\n\n\nScenario 3: Technological Transformation\n\n\n\nTechnological advancements, particularly the rise of digital currencies, could significantly impact the pace and extent of de-dollarization.\n\n\u25cf Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) : Developing and adopting CBDCs could provide viable alternatives to the dollar for international transactions. China\u2019s digital yuan is a leading example, already being used in cross-border transactions and potentially reducing reliance on the dollar. By June 2024, nearly 100 CBDCs were globally in research or development stages, with some already used for cross-border transactions\n\n\u25cf Blockchain and Fintech Innovations : Implementing technologies like blockchain could facilitate more efficient and secure international trade without needing a dominant reserve currency. The BRICS Pay initiative aims to streamline transactions among BRICS countries using blockchain, an example of such innovation. Developed in 2018, this platform will enhance real-time transactions between member countries.\n\n\n\nIs De-dollarization a Myth?\n\n\n\nDespite the trends towards de-dollarization, many experts believe the US dollar will retain its dominant position for the foreseeable future. The dollar's enduring trust and liquidity are key factors in this. It remains the most trusted and liquid currency worldwide, accounting for approximately 69% of global currency usage, with the euro at 23%. It is also the preferred currency for international debt issuance and cross-border loans, making up about 60% of disclosed foreign currency reserves.\n\nThe dollar's entrenched global trade and finance position provides a robust foundation. For example, 88% of all over-the-counter foreign exchange transactions involve the US dollar. Despite a gradual decline, the dollar's share in global export invoicing remains high.\n\nAlternatives like the euro and the renminbi face significant challenges. Despite its growth, the renminbi accounts for only 2.3% of global payments via SWIFT and 7% of global currency transactions. Other potential contenders lack the geopolitical and economic stability required for a currency to be a dominant reserve.\n\nSome analysts and economists believe cryptocurrencies could replace the dollar as an international payment, which is also unlikely. will never replace the US dollar because of its high volatility, lack of centralized control, and limited integration into the global financial system.\n\nIn the Weekly timeframe, USDollar, after a strong fall in a long-term uptrend, formed an ascending triangle pattern, which is usually a classic bullish pattern. Bulls Power and MA200 indicate bullish sentiment in the market, so we can expect the to rise further on the rise above the resistance area.\n\n\n\n\u25cf USDollar buying can be considered on a break above the resistance at 106.500, with a target of 109.000, corresponding to 61.8 Fibonacci.\n\nExpert opinions reinforce the dollar's staying power. Analysts from institutions like the IMF and JP Morgan emphasize that while de-dollarization is a trend to watch, the complete displacement of the dollar is unlikely. They highlight the resilience of the dollar's dominance in global finance, particularly given its pivotal role in international transactions and reserves.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nDespite the rising discourse on de-dollarization, the idea that the US dollar will lose its global dominance appears improbable. While countries like China and Russia actively pursue strategies to reduce their reliance on the dollar, the global financial system's entrenched dependence on the greenback remains robust.\n\nThe dollar's supremacy is underpinned by the extensive size and stability of the US economy, its influential geopolitical position, and the deep liquidity of its financial markets. These factors create a resilient foundation for the dollar, making a sudden shift towards alternative currencies highly unlikely.",

        "body": "US stocks rally after Chairman Powell\u2019s comments\n\nFocus on key US data today ahead of Thursday\u2019s bank holiday\n\nDovish ECB commentary to keep euro under pressure\n\nDollar/yen rally continues\n\nUS Stocks Rally after Powell\u2019s Comments\n\nThe ECB-dominated forum held in Sintra, Portugal, managed to produce market-moving headlines for the Fed. Chairman Powell\u2019s comment that \u201cwe are back in a disinflationary environment\u201d resulted in a strong rally in the US equities. Both the and indices recorded new all-time highs led by technology stocks, but not Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), which has already recorded an impressive price jump in 2024.\n\nThis equities\u2019 reaction was interesting as (a) Chairman Powell\u2019s speech was not as dovish as the disinflationary comment since he highlighted the need for more progress on inflation and (b) the market showed unexpected sensitivity to dovish commentary, even though it has been consistently ignoring hawkish commentary or stronger data releases. This eagerness to get lower Fed rates is understandable, but it also raises the possibility of a strong correction if this week\u2019s data fail to appease the market.\n\nWith the US celebrating its Independence Day tomorrow and enjoying a rare mid-week bank holiday, the data calendar is pretty full today. The ADP employment change, the weekly jobless claims and the Challenger job cuts are probably the best appetizer for Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll figures. In addition, the final print of the ISM Services survey and the factory orders data could provide further evidence of a slowdown in the US economy and support the expectations for a September rate cut.\n\nIn the meantime, speculation about President Biden\u2019s possible withdrawal from the November election continues with the top US pollsters already measuring up the likely replacements. Vice President Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama feature in the shortlist with the latter possibly being the Democrats\u2019 best bet of winning Donald Trump.\n\nEuro Survives the Barrage of Dovish ECB Commentary\n\nA plethora of ECB speakers will be on the wires again today, including President Lagarde and uber-dove Knot, with the managing to easily digest yesterday\u2019s barrage of dovish commentary. The ECB doves are desperately trying to lay the path for another rate cut in September, but most ECB hawks remain adamant that significant progress has to be made to justify such a decision. Lagarde is trying to find the balance between the two sides, but her role will increasingly become tougher, especially if data does not gradually weaken further.\n\nIn the meantime, France is preparing for Sunday\u2019s second round of the parliamentary elections. Monday\u2019s positive reaction in most European stock markets was probably premature since Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party could still gain the majority in the parliament and make President Macron\u2019s life difficult for the next three years. The effort from both the left-wing New Frontier party and Macron\u2019s alliance to support common candidates in the second round is not progressing well as centrist candidates are not overly fond of supporting members of ultra-left parties.\n\nJapanese Data Releases Do Not Offer Much Support to the Yen\n\ncontinues its journey north, testing the BoJ\u2019s patience, as data disappoints again. Similarly to China\u2019s results, the June PMI Services survey from Japan dropped to the lowest point since April 2022. Should next week\u2019s data calendar, which includes average cash earnings and producer prices index figures, disappoint the BoJ will probably have to abandon any thoughts of adopting a more hawkish stance at the July 31 meeting.",

        "title": "Gold Drops Ahead of Key US Economic Data; Euro Unchanged Despite a Weak US Dollar",
        "body": "Gold Consolidates Ahead of Important US Reports\n\nYesterday, declined by 0.1% as Jerome Powell didn't provide investors with specifics about the timing of the interest rate cuts.\n\nThe gold market has been moving in a narrow range of 2,320\u20132,340 for the last three days. There is a strong accumulation, followed by an impulse exit from the corridor. Many analysts hope for a sharp XAU/USD rise due to the US elections. Yesterday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the US returned to the path of disinflation, but it was necessary to ensure that inflation figures give an accurate picture of the economy's health before cutting rates. The market is waiting for the most important employment US data\u2014the Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report, due to be published on Friday. The data can have a strong impact on the market, including gold.\n\n\"There's a clear path for gold to outperform from here, likely fuelled by Western flows. Conversely, in the event that central bank demand drops drastically, rates remain high for longer and Asian investor sentiment flips, we could see a pullback in the second half\", the World Gold Council said in its mid-year outlook report.\n\nToday, investors expect a string of US reports: ADP Employment at 12:15 p.m. UTC, Jobless Claims at 12:30 p.m. UTC, ISM Services PMI at 2:00 p.m. UTC, and FOMC Minutes at 6:00 p.m. UTC. The data will likely strongly impact XAU/USD. If the data is weaker than expected, the pair may rise towards 2,360. Still, XAU/USD may reach the low of 2,300 if US reports outperform forecasts.\n\nEuro Moves Sideways Ahead of the Second Round of French Elections\n\nThe (EUR) was essentially unchanged on Tuesday, failing to break above the critical 1.07500 level despite the weakening .\n\nYesterday's dovish comments by Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman, offset the upbeat US labour market report and pushed the US dollar lower. However, the euro failed to gain additional ground despite the higher-than-expected eurozone core Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers. The euro may remain weak because investors and traders are still uneasy about the outcome of the French Parliamentary elections. The second round of voting is scheduled for 7 July. France may face a period of intense political instability and unsustainable government spending, with negative implications for all EUR pairs. Fundamentally, there is not much of a divergence in monetary policy expectations between the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB). Therefore, EUR/USD should probably move sideways in the short term, but political uncertainty will continue to exert downward pressure on the pair.\n\nEUR/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders will focus on four US reports: ADP Employment at 12:15 p.m. UTC, Jobless Claims at 12:30 p.m. UTC, ISM Services PMI at 2:00 p.m. UTC, and FOMC Minutes at 6:00 p.m. UTC. The data may significantly affect all USD pairs. If the reports come out stronger than expected, showing persistent tightness in the labour market and elevated business activity, EUR/USD will likely drop towards 1.07000. Otherwise, a minor bullish trend in EUR/USD may continue, but a break above 1.07800 is unlikely before the publication of the Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report later this week.\n\nDovish Fed's Comments Support British Pound\n\n\n\nThe (GBP) gained 0.29% on Tuesday as investors sold off (DXY) after it failed to hold above the critical 106.00 level.\n\nEven though yesterday's US jobs market report showed a strong increase in new job openings, US Treasury yields declined, pulling the US dollar (USD) lower. Most likely, yesterday's rally in GBP/USD was driven by two factors. First, traders decided to buy the British pound, hoping the pair would manage to hold above the support level of 1.26000. Second, the comments by Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed), were treated as dovish and reinforced the prospect of an interest rate cut in September. Powell said that the US was back on a disinflationary path.\n\n\"Listening to some of his comments, it seems he's laying the groundwork for cuts maybe in September, that's where the market thinks they're going to start\", said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are currently pricing in a 65% chance that the Fed will ease its monetary policy in September. On the other hand, interest rate swap market data implies that the Bank of England (BOE) may cut the rates as early as 1 August before the Fed does.\n\nGBP/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the US data is in the spotlight. Traders should focus on four reports: ADP Employment at 12:15 p.m. UTC, Jobless Claims at 12:30 p.m. UTC, ISM Services PMI at 2:00 p.m. UTC, and FOMC Minutes at 6:00 p.m. UTC. The data may significantly affect GBP/USD.\n\nMeanwhile, investors in the U.K. are shifting their focus to the upcoming generation elections due on 4 July. The impact of these elections on the British pound will depend on several factors. Firstly, it is not clear how many votes the Labour Party will get and whether or not the country will end up with a hung Parliament. Investors will likely consider a decisive victory by the Labour Party as a positive factor, driving GBP/USD higher. On the other hand, the party may consider raising taxes, potentially weakening the currency. Exit poll results will probably be announced in the late American session on 4 July, a US federal holiday. Thus, traders should prepare for extensive volatility in GBP pairs during the early Asian session on 5 July.",

        "body": "Investors expect two rate cuts, even though Fed signals one\n\nRecent data corroborates investors\u2019 take\n\nNonfarm payrolls waited for more confirmation\n\nThe report comes out on Friday, at 12:30 GMT\n\nFed Appears Hawkish, but Data Paint a Different Picture\n\nAt its latest gathering, the FOMC appeared more hawkish than expected, revising its interest rate projections from three quarter-point reductions by the end of the year to just one. That said, the softer-than-expected CPI numbers a few hours ahead of the decision did not convince market participants about policymakers\u2019 intentions.\n\nThe weaker-than-expected retail sales numbers for May and the slowdown in the core PCE price index for the same month corroborated that view. Indeed, according to Fed funds futures, investors are penciling in 48bps worth of reductions by December, assigning around a 75% probability for the first quarter-point rate cut to be delivered in September.\n\nThat said, the S&P Global PMIs for June suggested that the economy expanded at a faster pace than in May, which justifies remarks by Fed policymakers that there is no urgency in beginning to lower borrowing costs. However, the ISM manufacturing PMI on Monday came in weaker-than-expected, pointing to a third straight month of contraction in June.\n\nJob Gains and Wage Growth to Slow\n\nWhat could make the picture somewhat clearer may be Friday\u2019s employment report for June. Nonfarm payrolls in the world\u2019s largest economy are forecast to have increased by 195k, which is a notable slowdown from the astounding 272k a month before. The unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at 4.0%, while average hourly earnings are projected to have slowed to 3.9% from 4.1% y/y.\n\nA potential slowdown in job gains is underscored by the increase in initial jobless claims during the month, which is indirectly supporting the notion of a pay slowdown, as having more available workers to choose from is allowing firms to offer less.\n\nThis could result in lower inflation in the months to come and thereby add more credence to investors\u2019 view that interest rates in the US may need to be cut twice this year.\n\nDollar May Come Under Pressure\n\nErgo, in case of a weak employment report, Treasury yields could slip, thereby exerting pressure on the , which could suffer the most against its Australian counterpart. At its latest gathering, the RBA maintained its neutral stance, while Governor Bullock revealed that they discussed the option of raising rates. Due to that, the market is currently assigning a more than 50% chance for an RBA rate hike by November.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, has been trading in a sideways range since May 3, between the 0.6575 and 0.6690 levels. Although the price is closer to the upper bound, until and if this barrier is breached, the outlook remains neutral.\n\nA decisive break above 0.6690 could initiate a shift towards a more positive outlook, but the move carrying larger bullish implications may be a break above 0.6730. Such a move could pave the way towards the high of January 2, at around 0.6840. For the outlook to turn negative, the pair may need to slide below the 0.6575 zone, which is the lower end of the range.",

        "body": "Gartner (NYSE: ) is a research and advisory firm, which, through its Research, Consulting and Conferences segments, helps business leaders make better-informed decisions. The company was founded in 1979 and went public in 1993. Currently, in the vicinity of $450, the share price is not far from its all-time high of $487 and gives Gartner a market cap of almost $35B.\n\nThe stock is one of the best performers in the market since the COVID-19 pandemic struck. It is up by over 480% from its March 2020, bottom at $77 a share. In investing, however, the price paid can make all the difference between a good and a bad investment. With the benefit of hindsight, Gartner was obviously a good pick below $80 four years ago. The question is, is it a good pick now near $450?\n\nThe weekly chart above reveals the stock\u2019s entire progress since the aftermath of the Dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. We see that the COVID-19 selloff fits in the position of wave \u2018c\u2019 of a simple a-b-c zigzag correction in wave (2). It followed a complete five-wave impulse in wave (1), marked 1-2-3-4-5. Wave (3) was a fast sharp surge, caused by a combination of FOMO, stimulus money, and rising company profits at Gartner.\n\nThe bulls temporarily stepped aside in wave (4) in the first half of 2022, before coming back with a vengeance in wave (5). If this count is correct, Gartner stock is on the verge of completing an impulse pattern, which has been in progress for over two decades. Wave 5 of (5) can still exceed the $500 mark, but instead of chasing it, investors should probably start taking profits.\n\nThere are two main reasons for our pessimism. The first one is that according to the Elliott Wave theory, a three-wave correction follows every impulse. Corrections usually erase the entire fifth wave. Here, the bears can drag the price back down to the support of wave (4) near $250 for a 50% decline. This may sound too bearish until you consider the second reason for our pessimism, namely that Gartner is trading at a forward P/E of 39.\n\nThat\u2019s too expensive for a company expected to grow earnings and revenue at a high-single to low-double-digit rate per year. Instead of buying near all-time highs, we\u2019d rather watch from afar until the valuation risk subsides.",

        "title": "The Top 3 Stocks to Buy in July",
        "body": "These were the three top stocks on the S&P 500 in June.\n\nThe lagged a bit, gaining 1.1% in June, while small caps continued to struggle as the finished the month down 1.1%.\n\nThe also finished in the black for the second straight month, returning 3.5% in June. However, the was the big winner, recording one of its best months of the year with a 6.2% return in June.\n\nCorporate earnings remained strong, and while the Fed did not act on interest rates, inflation rates fell, indicating a continuing trend toward the Fed\u2019s target of 2% inflation.\n\nJune was an excellent month for the stock market as all of the major U.S. indexes posted positive returns.\n\nThree stock picks that could be worth a bet in July based on standout performance last month\n\n1. Adobe, up 24.9%\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ: ), which produces software for graphic design and photo editing, saw its share price spike in mid-June after the release of its fiscal second-quarter earnings.\n\nOn June 14, the share price jumped from $459 per share to $525 per share \u2014 a 14.4% leap \u2014 on a blowout earnings report that smashed estimates. Adobe stock ended the month up 24.9%.\n\nThe company generated record revenue of $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 10% year over year. Meanwhile, its net income skyrocketed 21.5% to $1.6 billion, or $3.50 per share.\n\n\u201cAdobe achieved record revenue of $5.31 billion driven by strong growth across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud,\u201d said Shantanu Narayen, chair and CEO of Adobe. \u201cOur highly differentiated approach to AI and innovative product delivery are attracting an expanding universe of customers and providing more value to existing users.\u201d\n\nAdobe also raised its revenue and earnings targets for its fiscal third quarter and the full fiscal year based on expectations for improved macroeconomic and foreign exchange environments.\n\nIt was a bounce-back month for Adobe. Even with the strong June performance, the stock is down 5.2% year to date.\n\n2. CrowdStrike, up 22%\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: ), which develops cybersecurity software, was the second-best performer on the S&P 500 in June, returning 22% for the month. Last month marked the continuation of a strong year for CrowdStrike stock, which has returned 50.5% YTD.\n\nJune was indeed an eventful month for the company as it was added to the S&P 500 on June 24. However, the major catalyst for CrowdStrike was its first-quarter fiscal-2025 earnings report, released on June 4.\n\nFollowing this blowout earnings report on June 4, CrowdStrike stock jumped from $305 per share to $343 per share the next day and kept rising from there.\n\nOne could see why, as CrowdStrike posted a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue to $921 million, while net income skyrocketed from $0.5 million in the same quarter a year ago to $43 million in the most recent quarter. Net earnings per share climbed to 18 cents per share, from 0 cents in the same quarter a year ago.\n\n\u201cIn addition to our strong top-line performance, financial highlights included record gross margin, significant year-over-year operating leverage, record free cash flow of $322 million or 35% of revenue and a rule of 68 on a free cash flow basis, showcasing our focus on profitably scaling the business to $10 billion ending ARR (annual recurring revenue) and beyond,\u201d said Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nCrowdStrike also boosted its revenue and earnings outlook for the fiscal second quarter and full fiscal year. For the second quarter, it is calling for revenue of $958.3 million to $961.2 million, and for the full year, it is targeting $3.976 billion to $4.01 billion in revenue.\n\n3. Broadcom, up 20.8%\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: ) has been a juggernaut over the past few years, and it is not slowing down. The AI chipmaker posted a 20.8% return in June, and its stock price is up about 47% YTD.\n\nLike the other two stocks on this list, Broadcom stock was fueled by an excellent quarterly earnings report in June. The company grew revenue by 43% year over year in its fiscal second quarter to $12.5 billion.\n\nIts net income tumbled about 40% year over year, but that was impacted by expenses related to the acquisition of VMware (NYSE: ) last year. However, the adjusted net income, minus acquisition costs and other one-time expenses, soared 20% to $5.4 billion, or $10.96 per share.\n\nThose gains were driven by its AI chips, which generated record revenue in the quarter.\n\nThe other huge catalyst was the announcement of a 10-for-one stock split, which will take effect on July 15. When the split kicks in, investors will receive nine additional shares for every share they own.\n\nThe stock split could also fuel future growth, as Broadcom\u2019s share price will be lower by a factor of 10, making it more accessible to more investors. It is currently trading at $1,638 per share.\n\nBeware Valuations Amid the Potential\n\nAll three of these stocks are trading at high multiples, so be mindful of their valuations. However, all have excellent earnings potential and are worth considering as long-term options.\n\nMost immediately, look for Broadcom to potentially pop after the stock split, but again, keep an eye on the price-to-earnings ratio.",

        "title": "Boeing Stock Forecast: About to Take Off or Major Crash Ahead?",
        "body": "Boeing (NYSE: ) has dominated the business pages lately, mainly concerning the safety of its 737 planes and the resulting whistleblower allegations.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer made headlines again on Monday after announcing that it had agreed a $4.7bn deal to buy parts supplier Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ). The news was warmly received by the market, with the stock retreating just slightly.\n\nHowever, partly thanks to the recent and ongoing scandals, Boeing stock is still down almost 30% YTD.\n\nSeveral experts have predicted a major crash for Boeing stock, but there are hints of a turnaround for the aerospace giant.\n\nSpirit acquisition \u2013 The ticket to delivery growth?\n\nBoeing has faced quality control issues in the past, resulting in delivery delays. For instance, Boeing\u2019s 737 Max was grounded for almost two years following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nAdditionally, in January 2024, the FAA stopped the production of the 737 Max after an Alaska Airlines flight suffered a mid-air blowout of its cargo door earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Boeing still has ambitions of growing its delivery numbers, with the Spirit acquisition highly likely to bolster this effort. This would significantly boost Boeing Commercial Airplanes\u2019 (BCA) margins as the company clears its multi-year backlog.\n\nMoreoverer, since the acquisition is an all-stock deal, Boeing can avoid using its precious cash reserves.\n\nFollowing the news, investment banking firm Jefferies reiterated its buy rating on the stock with a price target of $270, representing a 45% upside to the current price. The analysis also noted that the deal might dilute Boeing\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) for 2026, but that the benefits from the deal will be \u201cpriceless\u201d.\n\nDeutsche Bank also maintained a buy rating on the stock with a $225 price target. The bank noted that an equity-financed deal is better than a cash offer and that an equity offering would help move the share price up due to reduced liquidity risk.\n\nDisciplined cash flow management\n\nBoeing has also reported positive free cash flow over the past 12 months. Though the company has not paid dividends or repurchased its common stock for some time, it did repay over $5 billion in debt during FY23. This is indeed a sign of disciplined cash flow management.\n\nIn Q1, Boeing\u2019s top and bottom lines were above Wall Street estimates. Still, revenue for the company was down mainly due to a decline in total commercial airplane deliveries. The company will be hoping to overcome this issue with the acquisition of Spirit.\n\nWe will get a better idea of the company\u2019s plans when it reports its Q2 numbers towards the end of July.\n\nPromising stock performance\n\nEven though Boeing stock is down significantly from $215 in early January 2021 to about $185 now, it has still outperformed the S&P 500 in the last two years.\n\nBoeing stock returned -6% in 2021, -5% in 2022, and 37% in 2023. The S&P 500 returned 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24%, suggesting Boeing underperformed the S&P in 2021 alone.\n\nIt is tricky to judge whether the stock will outperform S&P in 2024 considering the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, with high oil prices and interest rates on top of Boeing\u2019s own 737 MAX issues. Still, several analysts believe the stock has ample room for growth.\n\nIs Boeing stock a buy?\n\nThere is no denying that Boeing needs to address a few key issues in the short term \u2013 growing delivery backlog, potential charges from the Department of Justice related to the 2018 and 2019 crashes of the 737 Max aircraft, and the search for a new CEO \u2013 before it can pull off a turnaround.\n\nHowever, Boeing is moving in the right direction, and while it would be fair to say that the firm faces near-term headwinds, its long-term growth prospects look promising.\n\nBased on this, we think Boeing stock would be a sensible buy right now.\n\nOriginal Post",
        "summary": "However, partly thanks to the recent and ongoing scandals, Boeing stock is still down almost 30% YTD.\nSeveral experts have predicted a major crash for Boeing stock, but there are hints of a turnaround for the aerospace giant.\nBoeing stock returned -6% in 2021, -5% in 2022, and 37% in 2023.\nIs Boeing stock a buy?\nBased on this, we think Boeing stock would be a sensible buy right now.",

        "title": "Nvidia: Can Chipmaker Reclaim Market-Cap Throne Amid Antitrust Scrutiny?",
        "body": "Nvidia briefly held the world's most valuable company title but lost ground to tech giants like Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe chipmaker faces antitrust investigations in Europe and potential fines for its dominant market share.\n\nDespite challenges, analysts remain bullish, citing Nvidia's strong financials and future potential.\n\nUnlock AI-powered Stock Picks for Under $8/Month: Summer Sale Starts Now!\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: ) meteoric rise in 2024 wasn't without its bumps. After a brief dip in April, the chipmaker surged to become the world's most valuable company by market cap on June 18th.\n\nHowever, its reign was short-lived. Since then, Nvidia has stumbled, falling behind tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) in terms of market capitalization.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nCEO Jensen Huang's company now faces the challenge of regaining its lost ground. Can Nvidia recapture the market cap crown once again?\n\nNvidia Faces Antitrust Heat in Europe\n\nFrance has thrown a wrench into Nvidia's plans with antitrust investigations, mirroring the challenges faced by tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Meta (NASDAQ: ).\n\nThe European authorities are concerned about Nvidia's dominant position in the graphics processing card (GPU) market, where they hold an 84% market share against competitors like Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AMD (NASDAQ: ). Here's the catch: Nvidia's GPUs are currently the go-to option for running generative AI systems, a technology with massive future potential.\n\nThis situation presents a double-edged sword. While Nvidia offers the best product for customers, it raises red flags for regulators. A violation of European antitrust rules could result in a hefty fine - up to 10% of annual global turnover. Considering Nvidia's 2023 revenue, that translates to a potential $6 billion penalty.\n\nNumbers Back Nvidia's Meteoric Rise\n\nNvidia's exceptional numbers highlight its status as an undisputed leader in today\u2019s most crucial industry. The company recorded $60.9 billion in revenues in 2023, marking a 125.9% year-on-year increase, and posted profits of $44.3 billion. This remarkable growth underscores Nvidia's strategic positioning and market dominance.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise contrasts sharply with the tech boom that propelled Cisco (NASDAQ: ) to the top in 2000, a period that ultimately led to the dot-com bubble burst. Unlike the hype-driven surge that saw Cisco lose 80% of its value, Nvidia's ascent is rooted in tangible results and industry innovation. Initially known primarily to gaming enthusiasts, Nvidia has gained widespread recognition through its solid performance and financial success, not just its brand name.\n\nAnalysts Bet on Nvidia\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Nvidia's future. Morgan Stanley recently raised its target price for the stock from $116 to $144 per share, reflecting a 17.4% increase from its July 2 closing price of $122.67. This \"overweight\" rating from Morgan Stanley is echoed by many market experts, who see Nvidia's shares as a strong buy.\n\nNvidia's sustained growth and robust financial health continue to attract investor confidence, reinforcing its position as a key player in the tech sector.\n\nSource Investing.com: data as of July 3, 2024\n\nOn average, analysts surveyed by InvestingPro set Nvidia's target price at $132.34 per share, up 7.88% from the July 2 price. As many as 51 experts assign the stock a Buy rating, for 4 it is Hold, while none recommend selling the stock.\n\nNvidia: Fairly Valued, But Can It Maintain the Meteoric Rise?\n\nInvestingPro's Fair Value analysis, based on 13 investment models, suggests Nvidia's current price might already reflect its intrinsic value. The model predicts a potential 6.6% decline. However, this indicator frequently updates with new data, and the current reading could be a sign that the company's strong fundamentals justify its massive $3 trillion market cap.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nIn simpler terms, Nvidia isn't necessarily overvalued based on Fair Value analysis. But after such a rapid ascent, it's natural to see consolidation periods where the stock regroups before its next leg up.\n\nAdding to the positive outlook, all indicators point towards Nvidia's excellent financial health. The company boasts a Piotroski score of 9, the highest possible rating for financial strength.\n\nThe Biggest Challenge: Living Up to Its Success\n\nPerhaps the biggest uncertainty surrounding Nvidia is its explosive growth. According to Chris Metcalfe, chief investment officer of IBOSS Asset Management, Nvidia has been responsible for a staggering 30% of the 's returns this year. In essence, Nvidia's biggest hurdle might not be French regulators, but rather exceeding the incredibly high expectations it has set for itself through its phenomenal performance.\n\n***\n\nThis summer, get exclusive discounts on our subscriptions, including annual plans for less than $8 a month!\n\nTired of watching the big players rake in profits while you're left on the sidelines?\n\nInvestingPro's revolutionary AI tool, ProPicks, puts the power of Wall Street's secret weapon - AI-powered stock selection - at YOUR fingertips!\n\nDon't miss this limited-time offer.\n\nSubscribe to InvestingPro today and take your investing game to the next level!\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This article is written for informational purposes only; it does not constitute a solicitation, offer, advice, counsel or recommendation to invest as such it is not intended to incentivize the purchase of assets in any way.

        "body": "Tesla's Q2 2024 production report surpassed expectations, sending its share price soaring\n\nDespite this, the automaker's deliveries are still down 4% year-on-year\n\nWith this mixed picture, we examine whether Tesla stock is a buy right now\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: ) stock surged some 9% higher on Tuesday as news of better-than-expected production and deliveries halted its recent downward trend.\n\nThe news, stemming from the release of Tesla\u2019s much-anticipated production and deliveries report for the second quarter, sent the automaker\u2019s stock up over $230 per share in Tuesday trading.\n\nTesla is still down 7.8% year-to-date (YTD) and 12.5% over the last 12 months (as of July 2), but Tuesday\u2019s performance provided investors with a welcomed boost.\n\nBut can it keep its momentum going? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nBeating Delivery Estimates\n\nAnalysts\u2019 consensus was that Tesla would deliver 436,000 cars in the second quarter, but the actual numbers came in about 2% higher, with roughly 444,000 deliveries. \u2018Deliveries\u2019 equate to cars sold, so this bodes well for Tesla\u2019s second quarter earnings, which are scheduled for release on July 23.\n\nTesla delivered 422,405 of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which are its most affordable brands. Meanwhile, its other models saw 21,551 deliveries. Overall, the combined total for deliveries was 443,956 in Q2.\n\nWhile this was a surprise, the figure is around 4% lower than Q2 2023. However, it is up substantially from Q1, when the EV maker had just 386,810 deliveries, its lowest number since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nTesla also made more vehicles than expected in the last quarter, producing 410,831 cars. That includes 386,576 Model 3 and Model Ys, and 24,255 for other models.\n\nIs Tesla Stock a Buy?\n\nTesla\u2019s production and deliveries report is certainly good news, but is it enough to warrant a buy? The numbers were still 4% below the same quarter a year ago, and that includes price cuts, low-interest financing, and other incentives to spur flagging sales.\n\nTesla is also seeing increased competition and is losing some market share in an industry that is growing, but at a slower pace.\n\nAnother issue is the CEO, Elon Musk, who is a polarizing figure, mostly for his activities outside of Tesla.\n\nA recent poll by market intelligence firm Caliber, as reported by Reuters, said Tesla\u2019s consideration score, which measures consumer interest in a brand, dropped to 31% after Q1, down from 70% in November of 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that Musk himself is contributing to the reputational downfall,\u201d Caliber CEO Shahar Silbershatz told Reuters earlier this year.\n\nThe other problem is Tesla\u2019s valuation is still high, with a P/E ratio of 54 and a forward P/E ratio of 85.\n\nThere are too many concerns around Tesla stock, not to mention its inflated price. But keep an eye on the next earnings report for more information on its trajectory.",

        "title": "3 Biotech Stocks That Could Gain Exponentially By Leveraging AI",
        "body": "Although fraught with risk, these biotech exposures bring enormous upside potential.\n\nIf there is any sector that could benefit from machine learning, it\u2019s the biotechnology sector. Life sciences are inherently multidisciplinary, generating vast amounts of complex data. AI tools can hone in on emergent patterns in that data, filtering it for insights that open avenues for new advances.\n\nThis could range from sequencing genomes to identify mutations to processing the entirety of a patient\u2019s clinical data to paint a clearer picture. Breaking down this data, too, reveals new patterns in the aggregate of thousands of patients.\n\nUltimately, the breakdown of such large biochemical datasets could lead to both disease predictions and new drug discoveries. Moreover, such AI tools don\u2019t have to carry the imposed burden of \u201cAI safety\u201d due to particular ideological constraints as demonstrated during Google\u2019s Gemini launch debacle.\n\nBut which AI-powered biotech firms have shown the most progress in leveraging AI?\n\n1. Skye Bioscience\n\nWhen pushing the medical envelope, this Californian biotech firm picked the unexplored endocannabinoid system (ECS) field. Naturally produced by the body, endocannabinoids act as neurotransmitters, relaying regulating signals across the body\u2019s cells.\n\nSkye Bioscience (NASDAQ: ) uses CB1-targeting molecules to modulate ECS to improve health. So far, the company has focused on the CB1 inhibitor nimacimab to treat obesity, fibrotic liver, pulmonary, and kidney disease, to name a few.\n\nJust for obesity alone, the addressable market is huge, up to $100 billion by 2030, as forecasted by Goldman Sachs. Moreover, there are indications that CB1 inhibition approach is of lower-risk profile than with current GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Trulicity. Based on this promise, Skye Bioscience is pushing nimacimab into Phase 2 trials by mid-summer 2024.\n\nAccordingly, SKYE stock has skyrocketed by 202% year-to-date. At the present price of $8, SKYE shares are nearly half their 52-week high of $15.60 while near the 52-week bottom of $7 per share, suggesting a favorable entry point. \u2019s forecasting places the average SKYE price target at $21 per share.\n\n2. AbCellera Biologics\n\nCanadian Abcellera Biologics (NASDAQ: ) developed a unique platform that combines big data automation to filter development candidates for investigational new drugs (INDs). Specifically, it aims to identify new antibodies via its proprietary monoclonal antibody (mAb) screening platform powered by machine vision and sequencing.\n\nHowever, the company is yet to establish clinical manufacturing capability, set for 2025. In other words, AbCellera is a pre-early-clinical stage company riding on speculation. Nonetheless, other biotech firms have shown confidence in AbCellera\u2019s pipeline model, such as Incyte (NASDAQ: ), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ), Prelude Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ) and Biogen (NASDAQ: ).\n\nIn 2017, AbCellera partnered with Pfizer (NYSE: ) for a multi-target research collaboration. These show AbCellera as a well-networked biotech company but for long-term investing exposure.\n\nYear-to-date, ABCL stock is down 54%. From the 52-week average price of $4.88, ABCL shares are down to $2.78, significantly under the 52-week high of $8 per share. Yet, Nasdaq\u2019s forecasting data points to an average price target of $12.6, making ABCL stock a potential massive wealth-maker.\n\n3. Janux Therapeutics\n\nTackling cancer, a manifestation of cell entropy, remains the holy grail of medicine. Janux\u2019s approach departs from the traditionally toxic T-cell engagers (TCEs) and favors the TRACTrs and TRACIrs pipeline.\n\nThese proprietary platforms promise increased blood serum stability and targeting accuracy to avoid toxic effects on non-tumor areas. AI can boost the development of bispecific molecules to bind to tumor antigens and T cells.\n\nJanux (NASDAQ: ) JANX007 and JANX008 are both in Phase 1 trials, targeting prostate cancer cells and solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Of the big pharma players, Janux established cooperation with Merck in 2020, ending March 2024 with a debt-free $652 million pile of cash.\n\nThis potent combo of financials and propelled JANX stock 264% year-to-date. At $41, JANX stock is still below the 52-week high of $65.60. The latter price level is aligned with Nasdaq\u2019s average JANX price target of $63.33 per share.\n\n***\n\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

        "body": "Tesla (NASDAQ: ) surges on surprising delivery numbers while Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) faces potential antitrust hurdles in France. Meanwhile, First Solar (NASDAQ: ) sees a price target adjustment from analysts.\n\nThree tech giants are making headlines in a volatile market for different reasons. Tesla\u2019s stock surged on better-than-expected delivery numbers, while Nvidia faces potential antitrust charges in France. Meanwhile, First Solar sees a price target adjustment from analysts. Here\u2019s a closer look at the latest developments for these closely watched stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Reports Better than Expected Q2 Delivery Numbers\n\nTesla\u2019s stock is on a tear, surging 8.93% to $228.59 as of 12:21 PM EDT on Tuesday. The electric vehicle maker delivered a positive surprise with its second-quarter delivery numbers, reporting 443,956 vehicles delivered, beating Wall Street estimates of 438,000. This marks Tesla\u2019s first delivery beat in four quarters, despite a 4.7% year-over-year decline.\n\n\n\nThe Model 3 and Model Y accounted for the bulk of deliveries at 422,405 units. Despite the recent rally, Tesla\u2019s stock remains down 8% year-to-date, with a market capitalization of $729.051 billion. Analysts are hailing this as a \u201chuge comeback\u201d for the EV giant, with the stock rising for the sixth consecutive trading day.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Reportedly to Face Antitrust Charges\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock is facing headwinds, down 1.69% to $122.20 as of 12:22 PM EDT. The chip maker is reportedly set to face antitrust charges from French regulators for allegedly anti-competitive practices.\n\n\n\nThis would mark the first enforcer to act against Nvidia, following dawn raids in the graphics cards sector last September. The investigation is part of a broader inquiry into cloud computing, with concerns raised about the sector\u2019s dependence on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA chip programming software.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, Nvidia\u2019s stock has shown remarkable performance year-to-date, up 146.85% with a staggering market cap of $3.007 trillion. Analysts even discuss the potential for a $10 trillion valuation, highlighting the company\u2019s dominant position in the .\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Stock Dips After Analyst Lower Price Target\n\nFirst Solar\u2019s stock is experiencing a pullback, down 3.53% to $214.85 as of 12:21 PM EDT. This comes as Robert W. Baird lowered its price target for the company from $344.00 to $307.00 while maintaining an \u201coutperform\u201d rating.\n\n\n\nDespite the reduction, the new target still suggests a 37.85% upside from the previous close. First Solar reported strong first-quarter earnings of $2.20 per share, beating estimates, with revenue up 44.8% year-over-year to $794.10 million. The company\u2019s consensus rating remains a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with an average price target of $266.04.\n\n\n\nWith a market cap of $22.971 billion and a PE ratio of 23.34, First Solar continues to be a significant player in the solar energy sector. Despite today\u2019s dip, its year-to-date return is 24.56%.\n\n***\n\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

        "body": "Monday\u2019s trading session didn\u2019t change much, with the gaining 0.27% and extending a short-term consolidation, remaining relatively close to a new record high reached on Friday at 5,523.64. It still looks like a flat correction within an uptrend. Are there any signs that may point to a more meaningful downward correction?\n\nAs I mentioned in my stock price forecast for July yesterday,\n\n\u201cWhile more advances remain likely, the likelihood of a deeper downward correction also rises. Overall, there have been no confirmed negative signals so far, but the May gain of 4.8% and June gain of 3.5% suggest a more cautionary approach for July. The market will be waiting for the quarterly earnings season in the second half of the month. Plus, there will be a series of economic data, including the CPI release on July 11, the Advance GDP number on July 25, and the FOMC Rate Decision on July 31.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the S&P 500 is likely to open 0.5% lower, as indicated by futures contracts. So, it may see more short-term uncertainty, and possibly more profit-taking action. For now, it still looks like a consolidation within an uptrend though.\n\nLast week, the investor sentiment remained basically unchanged, as indicated by the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey on Wednesday, which showed that 44.5% of individual investors are bullish, while 28.3% of them are bearish (up from last week's reading of 22.5%). The AAII sentiment is a contrary indicator in the sense that highly bullish readings may suggest excessive complacency and a lack of fear in the market. Conversely, bearish readings are favorable for market upturns.\n\nThe S&P 500 index continues sideways after breaking its upward trend line last week, as we can see on the daily chart.\n\nNasdaq 100 Remains Below 20,000\n\nOn Friday, the technology-focused reached a new record high of 20,017.71, before retracing the advance and closing slightly lower. It basically extended a consolidation following the first half of June rally. This morning, the Nasdaq 100 is expected to open 0.6% lower, retracing yesterday\u2019s advance of 0.66%.\n\nVIX Is Still Close to 12\n\nThe , also known as the fear gauge, is derived from option prices. In late May, it set a new medium-term low of 11.52 before rebounding up to around 15 on correction worries. Since the previous Thursday, it has been closing above the 13 level, showing increasing fear in the market, but on Friday, it dipped to a local low of 11.87. Yesterday, the VIX closed slightly above 12, which means that there is basically no fear in the market.\n\nHistorically, a dropping VIX indicates less fear in the market, and rising VIX accompanies stock market downturns. However, the lower the VIX, the higher the probability of the market\u2019s downward reversal.\n\nFutures Contract Is Closer to 5,500\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the hourly chart of the contract. This morning, it\u2019s trading closer to the 5,500 level after retracing its yesterday\u2019s rebound. The market may be forming a topping pattern; however, the support level is still around 5,500.\n\nConclusion\n\nStocks are likely to open lower this morning, retracing their yesterday\u2019s advances as there is growing uncertainty about a possible correction amid the coming economic data and earnings releases. The risk of a downward correction is increasing; however, it still looks like a flat correction of the uptrend.\n\nQuoting my yesterday\u2019s stock price forecast for July,\n\n\u201cInvestors continue pricing in the Fed\u2019s monetary policy easing that is supposed to happen this year. Hence, a medium-term downward reversal still seems a less likely scenario. However, the recent record-breaking rally may be a cause for some short-term concern as a downward correction may be coming.\u201d\n\nFor now, my short-term outlook remains neutral.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:",

        "body": "Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Chewy (NYSE: ), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) are making waves in the stock market today, each facing unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nAs the stock market continues to show volatility today, three companies are capturing investors\u2019 attention due to significant news and price movements. Tesla, Chewy Inc, and Walgreens Boots Alliance are all experiencing notable shifts in their stock prices and facing key developments that could impact their future performance.\n\nTesla Stock Gains Ahead of Q2 Vehicle Deliveries Report\n\nTesla\u2019s stock is surging today, up 6.51% to $210.76, as investors eagerly await the company\u2019s Q2 global vehicle deliveries report, set to be released on Tuesday, July 2, 2024.\n\n\n\nDespite the current rally, Tesla\u2019s year-to-date return remains negative at -15.10%. Analysts are predicting Q2 deliveries of around 436,000 vehicles, representing a 6.5% decrease from Q2 2023 but a 13% increase from Q1 2024. Some analysts are even more conservative, forecasting deliveries in the 410,000-425,000 range.\n\nBeyond vehicle deliveries, investors are also focusing on Tesla\u2019s energy storage business. The company deployed a record 4,053 MWh of energy storage in Q1 2024, with CEO Elon Musk projecting 200-300% year-over-year growth in this segment. Additionally, Tesla plans to unveil its \u201crobotaxi\u201d on August 8, 2024, which is seen as a potential catalyst for future growth.\n\nChewy Inc Stock Becomes Volatile After GameStop Short Squeeze Trader Announces Massive Stake\n\nChewy\u2019s stock experienced significant volatility today following news that Keith Gill, known as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d from the 2021 GameStop (NYSE: ) meme stock rally, has disclosed a 6.6% stake in the company.\n\n\n\nThe stock initially surged 15% in premarket trading but has since reversed those gains, currently trading down 6.15% at $25.57. Gill\u2019s stake, worth about $245 million, makes him the third-largest shareholder in Chewy.\n\nDespite today\u2019s downturn, Chewy\u2019s year-to-date return remains positive at 8.19%. The online pet food and medicine retailer, founded by current GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, has maintained stable sales despite weaker overall consumer spending. However, the company\u2019s P/E ratio of 143.37 and negative 5-year return of -26.96% highlight the challenges it faces in a competitive e-commerce landscape.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Slides After Boots CEO Quits\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance stock is down 4.18% today to $11.59, continuing a troubling trend for the company. WBA\u2019s year-to-date return stands at -54.48%, with a staggering 5-year return of -73.13%. The company recently missed Q3 earnings expectations and has been under pressure due to a weak outlook.\n\nAdding to investor concerns, Boots CEO Sebastian James announced he would leave the company in November 2024 after six years in the role.\n\n\n\nThis news comes as WBA has decided against selling or floating Boots for the second time in two years. Despite these challenges, under James\u2019 leadership, Boots\u2019 market share has grown for 13 successive quarters, with recent results showing total UK sales growth of 1.6% and comparable retail sales growth of 6%.\n\n***\n\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: \u2013 $123.54) update \u2013 The 2x Long NVDA ETF (NASDAQ: ) (NVDL \u2013 $69.55) had a record $743 million inflow of investor money during the week that ended Friday, June 21st. Perhaps that was the ultimate contrarian indicator, as the stock price fell from an intraday high of $140 on June 20th (Thursday) to a closing price of $118 on June 24th (Monday). That\u2019s a loss of $542 billion in market cap over a three-day period.\n\nNVDA is another bubble among the various asset bubble charts throughout history starting with the 1600\u2019s Dutch tulip bulb bubble on the upper left (source: @great_martis):\n\nWe\u2019re being told that \u201cit\u2019s different this time\u201d with respect to NVDA\u2019s market cap. One portfolio manager was on CNBC saying he expects NVDA to hit a $6 trillion market cap this year \u201cas investors realize how cheap the stock is\u201d That would be a double from the current stock price. It\u2019s a laughable prediction. That would take the trailing P/E to 144, the forward P/E to 68x and the price/sales to 76x.

        "title": "UK's Labour sweeps to power as Sunak concedes election By Reuters",
        "body": "By Andrew MacAskill, Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Keir Starmer will be Britain's next prime minister with his centre left Labour Party expected to win a huge majority in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative government by trouncing Rishi Sunak's party.\n\nWith many results still to be announced from Thursday's vote, centre-left Labour has already won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament, with an exit poll suggesting it would capture about 410.\n\nOn a humiliating night for Sunak, the Conservatives have so far only won 70 and were predicted to suffer the worst performance in the party's long history with voters punishing them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services, and a series of scandals.\n\n\"Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken and they're ready for change, to end the politics of performance, a return to politics as public service,\" Starmer said after winning his seat in London.\n\n\"The change begins right here ... You have voted. It is now time for us to deliver.\"\n\nSunak conceded defeat and said he had called Starmer to congratulate him on his victory.\n\n\"Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides,\" he said after regaining his seat. \"There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates ... I am sorry.\"\n\nDespite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party, and he comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.\n\nBritain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.\n\nHe has already had to scale back some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, while he has promised not to raise taxes for \"working people\".\n\nMuch of the heavy damage to the Conservative support was inflicted by the right-wing populist Reform UK party, headed by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, who had campaigned strongly on curbing immigration.\n\nStarmer has promised to scrap the Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but will be under pressure himself to find a solution to stopping tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel on small boats.\n\nWithin the Conservative party, the recriminations and debate over its future direction immediately began, with some saying its failure stemmed from abandoning the centre ground while others argued Reform had won over voters who felt the party had deserted its roots.\n\nReform captured four seats, with Farage himself finally being elected to parliament at his eighth attempt, and won more votes than the Conservatives across swathes of the country.\n\n\"There is a massive gap on the centre right of British politics and my job is to fill it, and that's exactly what I'm going to do,\" a triumphant Farage said. \"Believe me, folks, this is just the first step of something that is going to stun all of you.\"\n\nPOPULIST ALTERNATIVE\n\nThe rise in support for a populist alternative echoed recent similar results in Europe, where the far right have been surging.\n\nBut, unlike France where Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party made historic gains in an election last Sunday, overall the British public has plumped for a centre-left party to bring about change.\n\nStarmer has promised to improve relations with the European Union to resolve issues created by Brexit, just as far-right politicians are enjoying success. However, despite opposing Brexit, rejoining the European Union is not on the table.\n\nHe may also have to work with Donald Trump in the United States if he wins November's presidential election, but he has vowed to continue London's unequivocal support for Ukraine.\n\nThe election victory would represent an incredible turnaround for Starmer and Labour, which critics and supporters said was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have lost its way after its 2019 drubbing.\n\nBut a series of Conservative scandals - most notably revelations of parties in Downing Street during COVID lockdowns - undermined then prime minister Boris Johnson and its commanding poll leads evaporated.\n\nLiz Truss' disastrous six-week premiership, which followed Johnson being forced out at the end of 2022, cemented the decline, and Sunak was unable to make any dent in Labour's now commanding poll lead.\n\nSunak stunned Westminster and many in his own party by calling the election earlier than he needed to in May with the Conservatives trailing Labour by some 20 points in opinion polls, and his campaign then proved a disaster.\n\n\"We deserved to lose. The Conservative Party just appears exhausted and out of ideas,\" Ed Costello, the chairman of the Grassroots Conservatives organisation, which represents rank-and-file members, told Reuters.\n\n\"But it is not all Rishi Sunak\u2019s fault. It is Boris Johnson and Liz Truss that have led the party to disaster. Rishi Sunak is just the fall guy.\"",

        "title": "US employment, wage growth expected to moderate in June By Reuters",
        "body": "By Lucia Mutikani\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth likely slowed to a still-healthy pace in June, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4%, increasing the chances that the Federal Reserve will be able to tame inflation without tipping the economy into recession.\n\nThe Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday is also expected to show annual wage growth rising at its slowest rate in three years. When added to the moderation in prices in May, the report would confirm that the disinflationary trend was back on track after inflation surged in the first quarter.\n\nIt also could boost Fed policymakers' confidence in the inflation outlook and push the U.S. central bank a step closer to start cutting rates later this year.\n\nFinancial markets remain optimistic the Fed could start its easing cycle in September after aggressively tightening monetary policy in 2022 and 2023. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week that the economy was back on a \"disinflationary path,\" but stressed policymakers needed more data before cutting rates.\n\n\"The economy is moving into a reasonable and sustainable, pace of employment growth,\" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. \"There's no evidence of any sudden decline, nothing that would suggest we're suddenly going to tip over. We're still basically tracking a 'soft landing.'\"\n\nNonfarm payrolls likely increased by 190,000 jobs last month after surging by 272,000 in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Employment gains have averaged about 230,000 jobs per month over the past 12 months.\n\nEconomists say the economy needs to create at least 150,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population, accounting for the recent surge in immigration.\n\nThe jobless rate rose to 4.0% in May for the first time since January 2022, boosted by volatile youth unemployment. Some economists expected it to drop back to 3.9% in June.\n\nA lagging measure of employment, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), has suggested a much slower pace of job growth through the fourth quarter of 2023 than that of the payrolls data. The QCEW data is derived from reports by employers to the state unemployment insurance (UI) programs.\n\nBENCHMARK ESTIMATE\n\nBut economists argue the QCEW data does not include undocumented immigrants, a group that they believe contributed to strong job growth last year. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish next month its payrolls benchmark estimate for the 12 months through March of this year.\n\n\"Payrolls are on track to be revised downward, but we believe that's not because payrolls are overcounting but because QCEW is undercounting,\" said Sam Coffin, an economist at Morgan Stanley. \"Because QCEW is based on UI records, it likely misses counting those who are not authorized to work. If one's not authorized to work, one also is not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. In contrast, the payroll survey asks that employees be counted regardless of legal status.\"\n\nHiring has been largely driven by sectors like healthcare, leisure and hospitality as well as state and local government education, which has seen staffing levels head back to pre-pandemic levels. That trend likely persisted in June, though at a more moderate pace than in the past months.\n\nEmployment in these sectors is mostly back at 2019 levels, and the 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the Fed since 2022 to curb inflation has weighed on business formation.\n\nExcess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic have been exhausted, contributing to a slowdown in demand for both labor, goods and services.\n\n\"There's been a lot of the catch-up hiring that needed to be done to get businesses re-staffed again,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. \"That's largely complete across a lot of different sectors.\"\n\nEven as the labor market is cooling, wage growth remains sufficient to sustain consumer spending and the overall economic expansion.\n\nAverage hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% in June after climbing 0.4% in May. That would lower the annual increase in wages to 3.9%, the smallest gain since June 2021, from 4.1% in May. Wage growth in a 3%-3.5% range is seen as consistent with the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nThe central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. The minutes of the Fed's June 11-12 meeting, which were published on Wednesday, showed policymakers acknowledged the economy appeared to be slowing and that \"price pressures were diminishing.\"\n\nEconomists argue the labor market is not driving up inflation, noting that worker productivity has picked up, and worry that the Fed could stifle growth by keeping borrowing costs elevated for too long.\n\n\"Wage growth had been high earlier in this expansion, but it's come down, said Kevin Rinz, a senior fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"Productivity growth has returned to the normal relationship it has with wage growth such that there's not a huge gap between those two. It doesn't really seem necessary at this point to be constraining the labor market for the sake of reducing inflation.\"",

        "body": "By Jessie Pang and Marcus Lum\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - An increase in the duty-free quota for Chinese tourists to Hong Kong may go some way to support the city's retailers, but visitors from the mainland say prices are still unattractive.\n\nFrom expanding the solo travel scheme for Chinese visitors to Hong Kong in May to bumping up the duty-free shopping quota, the China and Hong Kong governments are striving to lure tourists from across the border.\n\nThis comes as Hong Kong residents increasingly flock to the mainland for shopping and entertainment, saying prices there are generally lower and the service is better, and the Asia financial hub struggles to recover after the pandemic.\n\nStarting from July 1, the duty-free shopping quotas for Chinese tourists in Hong Kong were increased from 5,000 yuan ($688) per trip to 15,000 yuan for those visiting via six land border control points.\n\nThe new measure will be expanded to include Chinese visitors entering Hong Kong at all border control points from Aug. 1.\n\nThe government said it expects the measure to bring additional shopping spending of between HK$8.8 billion ($1.13 billion) and HK$17.6 billion to the city.\n\nAnnie Tse Yau On-yee, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, said it would take time to see the benefits of the changes.\n\nHong Kong's May retail sales slumped 11.5% from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, reflecting a surge in outbound trips, strength in the local currency and a high base of comparison for visitor spending last year.\n\n\"Considering the speedy business downturn, together with high rent and manpower costs, other economic factors, such as the strong Hong Kong dollar, also pose challenges to the retail industry,\" said Bond Law, an executive director of the association, adding the situation is expected to remain difficult for some time.\n\nHarbour City, a shopping mall in the tourist area of Tsim Sha Tsui, said it believes \"this policy change will have a positive impact, driving up retail sales and attracting more tourists to Hong Kong and to our mall\".\n\nHong, 49, and his wife Chen 43, who were visiting Hong Kong from China's Guangxi province for the first time, said the cost of dining in the city was still a barrier.\n\n\"The food here is five times more expensive than the food back in the city where I currently live,\" Chen, who only wanted to be known by her surname, said as she held bags of clothes and cosmetics from various luxury brands.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors has risen in recent months, according to data from the tourism board, but analysts say consumption trends have changed.\n\nCost-conscious Chinese tourists have replaced many of the cash-rich mainland travellers who once flocked to Hong Kong, with some only interested in free walking tours of the city and taking photographs.\n\nSienna Zheng, 29, a tourist from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen said she did not plan to purchase many luxury goods during her fourth visit to Hong Kong.\n\n\"I came to visit different places for photos and try out the foods,\" Zheng said, adding that even though the products in Hong Kong are tax-free the prices are similar to the mainland.\n\n($1 = 7.2701 )\n\n($1 = 7.8093 Hong Kong dollars)",

        "body": "By Satoshi Sugiyama and Leika Kihara\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese household spending unexpectedly fell in May as higher prices continued to squeeze consumers' purchasing power, data showed on Friday, complicating the central bank's decision on how soon to raise interest rates.\n\nMany analysts expect consumption to rebound in coming months as big wage hikes offered by companies and a tax break aimed at cushioning the blow from rising living costs reach households.\n\nBut the soft reading underscores the fragile nature of consumption, and casts doubt on the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) view a solid economic recovery will keep inflation durably around its 2% target - a prerequisite for raising interest rates.\n\n\"The BOJ has been saying all along that consumption is firm. Today's data could force the bank to alter that view and make it difficult to justify a rate hike in July,\" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus.\n\nConsumer spending fell 1.8% in May from a year earlier, far short of the median market forecast for a 0.1% uptick, as rising food prices weighed on spending for other items, data showed.\n\nDemand for overseas package tours also fell due to the weak yen, which makes travelling abroad expensive. Spending fell 0.3% in May on a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis.\n\nThe soft reading comes in the wake of an unexpected downward revision to Japan's first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) and a slew of surveys showing worsening consumer sentiment.\n\nSluggish private consumption is a source of concern for policymakers striving to achieve sustained economic growth underpinned by solid wages and durable inflation, which are prerequisites for normalising monetary policy.\n\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said he expects consumption to recover as big wage hikes offered by many firms, and government subsidies to curb electricity bills, prop up household income.\n\nJapanese firms offered to hike pay by 5.1% on average this year, the biggest hike in 33 years and exceeding inflation now hovering around 2%, a labour union survey showed on Wednesday.\n\nMany analysts expect the BOJ to hold off on raising rates this month to await more evidence that wage hikes will spread to smaller firms and boost consumption.\n\nBut some suspect that rising inflation, driven in part by a weak yen that boosts import costs, may prompt the BOJ to act.\n\n\"The BOJ will probably stick to its view the weakness in consumption will prove temporary,\" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.\n\n\"It could even decide to raise rates in July if it sees rising inflation as the key factor hurting consumption, and feels the need to forestall the risk of further price rises.\"\n\nThe BOJ next meets for a policy meeting on July 30-31, when it will also produce fresh quarterly growth and price forecasts that serves as a basis for deciding future monetary policy.\n\nJapan's economy shrank more than initially reported in the January-March quarter in a rare, unscheduled revision to GDP data. But many economists expect growth to rebound this quarter thanks to higher wages and robust capital expenditure.",

        "body": "By Ankur Banerjee and Sameer Manekar\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was hovering near three-week lows on Friday ahead of payrolls data that will likely influence the outlook for rates, while the pound was firm as the Labour party looked set to win a massive majority in the UK general election.\n\nSterling was last at $1.27575, little changed in early trading and not far off a three-week high of $1.27765 touched on Wednesday.\n\nIt is up 0.9% for the week, its best weekly performance since mid-May and remains the strongest-performing major currency against the dollar this year with a gain of 1.2%.\n\nCentre-left Labour was on course to capture 410 of the 650 seats in parliament, a majority of 170 seats and affording investors some much-needed certainty after years of market volatility under the Conservatives.\n\n\"I don\u2019t expect a new government to lead with a dramatic policy move any time soon, they will have learnt from mistakes of the past,\" Orla Garvey, senior portfolio manager for fixed income at Federated Hermes (NYSE: ).\n\n\"This pushes the risks associated with the UK election a little further down the line.\"\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.0816 as traders refrained from making major bets with France gearing up for the run-off election on Sunday. Polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) is likely to fall short of a majority.\n\nThe single currency, which has been under pressure since French elections were called in June, is up nearly 1% for the week and on track for its strongest weekly performance of the year.\n\nWhile worries that RN could gain a majority and introduce big spending increases have receded, the country is headed for a hung parliament which is likely to weigh on sentiment, analysts said.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to see a dynamic where any fiscal measures of substance are passed in France,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\nU.S. traders return from their July 4th holiday and the spotlight will firmly be on non-farm payrolls, due later on Friday. The report is expected to show an increase of 190,000 jobs in June after a rise of 272,000 in May, according to a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nA slew of economic data showing a cooling U.S. economy has heightened expectations the data-sensitive Federal Reserve will cut rates sometime soon. Traders are pricing in a 73% chance of a cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nMarkets are also pricing in potentially two rate cuts this year, although the Fed last month forecast just one rate cut for 2024. Much will depend on upcoming data.\n\n\"A softer (payrolls) print should further boost rate cut expectations and add to USD downside,\" said Christopher Wong, an FX strategist at OCBC.\n\nThe , which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was down 0.1% at 105.05, close to its lowest point since mid-June.\n\nThe yen was 0.16% higher, up for a second straight day - something that hasn't happened since the start of June. It last fetched $161.095 per dollar, crawling slowly away from the 38-year low of 161.96 on Wednesday.\n\nTraders have been wary of Japanese authorities intervening in the market to prop up the currency which has lost more than 12% against the dollar this year, weighed down by the wide interest rate difference between Japan and the United States.\n\nTokyo spent some 9.8 trillion yen in late April and early May to intervene in the currency market when the yen hit a then 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar. Analysts say, however, that authorities will focus on the pace of yen weakening and not just the levels.\n\nIn other currencies, the Australian dollar rose 0.16% to $0.6736, hovering near six-month highs, while the New Zealand dollar stood at $0.6121.

        "body": "Investing.com - Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, is on the brink of becoming the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, based on the latest exit poll predictions.\n\nThe survey indicates that the Labour Party is heading for a historic victory in the parliamentary election, while Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is predicted to encounter a record defeat.\n\nThe exit poll indicates that Labour could secure 410 seats out of the 650-seat parliament, establishing a majority of 170 and marking the end of the 14-year Conservative reign. In contrast, the Conservative Party is expected to secure only 131 seats, a steep decline from the 346 seats they held when parliament was dissolved.\n\nThis would mark the worst electoral performance in the party's history, a result of public dissatisfaction with the cost-of-living crisis and years of political instability and internal disagreements.\n\nPat McFadden, Labour's campaign coordinator, emphasized Labour's readiness to implement change, stating, \"If we are successful tonight, Labour will get to work immediately with our first steps for change.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, a centrist party, are projected to secure 61 seats, while the right-wing populist Reform UK, led by Brexit advocate Nigel Farage, is expected to win 13 seats. Despite Reform UK's better-than-predicted performance, the overall election results seem to indicate a shift in public preference towards the centre-left.\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP), known for its pro-independence stance, is forecasted to win only 10 seats \u2013 their worst performance since 2010. The SNP has faced significant turmoil, including leadership changes, a police investigation into party finances, and policy disagreements.\n\nThe exit poll's accuracy is generally reliable, with only one misprediction in the last six UK elections. The official results will be released in the next few hours.\n\nSunak's decision to call an election earlier than necessary in May, despite trailing Labour by approximately 20 points in opinion polls, surprised many. His hope that the deficit would dwindle, as traditionally happens in British elections, did not materialize during the campaign. A series of scandals, including suspicious bets placed on the election date and an early departure from D-Day commemorative events in France, further marred the Conservative campaign.\n\nIf the exit poll proves accurate, it would represent a significant comeback for Starmer and the Labour Party. Despite the lack of overt enthusiasm for Starmer, his straightforward message promoting change seems to have resonated with the voting public.",

        "body": "Investing.com-- Asian stocks were a mixed bag on Friday with Chinese shares sliding further on increased tensions with Taiwan, while South Korean markets outperformed on gains in Samsung.\n\nBroader markets were mostly rangebound in anticipation of key U.S. data later in the day.\n\nA U.S. market holiday on Thursday made for limited trading cues, while some cooling sentiment over interest rate cuts also factored into market caution. U.S. stock index futures moved little in Asian trade.\n\nChinese stocks sink as Taiwan tensions grow\n\nChinese stocks were the worst performers for the day, with the and indexes losing about 1% each. Both indexes extended a slump seen through most of June and early-July.\n\nFriday\u2019s were driven by concerns over increased tensions with Taiwan, after reports said China had seized a Taiwanese fishing trawler operating near the Chinese coast. Reports on Friday also said that Chinese military aircraft were in the Taiwan strait.\n\nOther reports also showed Taiwanese firms were pulling out staff from China, after Beijing warned of extreme measures, including the death penalty, against supporters of an independent Taiwan.\n\nMarkets feared that any escalation in tensions, particularly aggression by Beijing, could draw in U.S. ire and spark more economic restrictions against China.\n\nLosses in mainland stocks pulled Hong Kong\u2019s index down 0.8%.\n\nSouth Korean stocks outperform as Samsung flags bumper Q2\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s was the best performer in Asia on Friday, rising nearly 1%.\n\nThe index was boosted by a 1.5% rise in Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), the largest stock in the country, after the electronics conglomerate flagged a 15-fold spike in its second quarter profit.\n\nSamsung benefited greatly from increased demand for memory chips from the artificial intelligence industry, which pushed up sales and also improved margins. Its consumer electronics business was also seen benefiting somewhat from AI integration.\n\nGains in Samsung spilled over into other chipmaking stocks. Memory chips rival SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) rose 1.7%.\n\nJapanese stocks test record highs amid weak yen, BOJ bets\n\nJapan\u2019s and indexes steadied near record highs on Friday, with the latter briefly hitting record levels.\n\nRecent strength in Japanese markets was driven by export-oriented stocks surging against a weaker , while the prospect of limited monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan also boosted sentiment.\n\nHousehold spending data read substantially softer than expected for May on Friday, furthering the notion that the Japanese economy remained fragile and will need more monetary support. This in turn furthered bets that the BOJ has limited headroom to tighten policy further, keeping in place most of the ultra-loose monetary conditions enjoyed by Japanese markets for nearly a decade.\n\nJapanese tech stocks also tracked gains in Samsung. Investment giant SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO: ) rose 0.4% and sat at record highs as a report said the firm was seeking large volumes of chips from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ).\n\nBroader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range. Concerns over China saw Australia\u2019s fall 0.2%.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s index pointed to a mildly negative open, with Indian shares vulnerable to some profit taking after a series of record highs over the past week.",

The electronics giant only provided a preliminary estimate of its second quarter earnings on Friday, and will release its comprehensive earnings later in July.\n\nBut growth in Samsung\u2019s earnings comes on the back of increased demand for memory chips from the AI industry, particularly high-bandwith memory chips. Samsung said it will begin mass producing advanced HBM chips from this year, with a view to win more orders from AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ).\n\nAI helped drive up demand for the chip industry over the past year, as a growing number of firms raced to capture market share from majors such as OpenAI with their own offerings.\n\nSamsung\u2019s device sales, particularly those of its flagship S-series smartphones, also benefited from AI integration.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services sector activity slumped to a four-year low in June amid a sharp drop in orders, potentially hinting at a loss of momentum in the economy at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing purchasing managers (PMI) index dropped to 48.8 last month, the lowest level since May 2020, from 53.8 in May. It was the second time this year that the PMI had dropped below 50, which indicates contraction in the services sector.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the services PMI slipping to 52.5. The PMI fell below the 49 level that the ISM says over time generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. The survey's business activity measure dropped to 49.6, the first contraction since May 2020, from 61.2 in May.\n\nThe ISM reported on Monday that manufacturing activity had deteriorated further in June.\n\nThe surveys, however, likely understate the economy's health, with so-called hard data like consumer spending suggesting a moderate pace of growth last quarter. The economy is adjusting to higher interest rates, which are slowing demand.\n\nGrowth estimates for the second quarter are around a 2% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.4% pace in the January-March quarter.\n\nThe survey's new orders measure dropped to 47.3, the lowest since December 2022, from 54.1 in May. Services employment continued to decline. That would suggest softer job growth in the months ahead, though the sentiment surveys have not been reliable predictors of payroll gains.\n\nThe government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 190,000 jobs in June after rising 272,000 in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4%.\n\nServices inflation slowed a bit last month. The ISM's prices paid measure for services inputs slipped to 56.3 from 58.1 in May.

        "title": "Chinese electric car makers hit with new European Union tariffs",
        "body": "EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs\n\n19 hours ago By Jo\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\n\nGetty Images MG owner SAIC is one the car makers hardest hit by the new tariffs\n\nThe European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China\u2019s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by \"unfair subsidisation\", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU\u2019s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: \"I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46.\" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs.\n\nWinners and losers\n\nThey were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. \"The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,\" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: \"I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty.\" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU. That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will \"give the automaker an advantage in the European market\". Lu\u00eds Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because \"other brands would also be affected\".\n\nPortuguese executive Lu\u00eds Filipe Costa chose a BYD Seal over Western brands\n\nGeely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will \"still export to the EU profitably\" but \"its profits will be significantly reduced.\" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs. Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. \"Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,\" Mr Koopmann says. \"If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision.\"\n\nLocalising production\n\nWhile some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit \"will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,\" Rhodium says. \"The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault.\" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. \"It\u2019s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,\" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. \"The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.\"",

        "body": "'Airport parking firms left us out of pocket'\n\n24 hours ago By Clodagh Stenson , BBC South Investigations \u2022 Alex Bish , BBC South East Investigations Share\n\nKim Renyard Kim Renyard said she had not been fully reimbursed by the parking firm she used\n\nHolidaymakers say they have been left hundreds of pounds out of pocket after using two meet-and-greet car parking firms at Gatwick, the UK's second largest airport. One passenger said she had to get a taxi nearly 150 miles home to Norfolk after Drive Park and Fly told her they could not find her car key when she arrived at the West Sussex airport. Meanwhile, a Galaxy Parking Limited customer said he was charged six pounds each time his car entered and exited the Gatwick drop-off zone while he was on holiday. The BBC has contacted both firms - which are not connected to Gatwick Airport - multiple times for a comment, but they are yet to respond.\n\nWest Sussex Trading Standards said it had received 199 complaints about a number of parking operators since 2022/23. Kim Renyard said that when she tried to pick her car up, Drive Park and Fly said her keys \u201chad been lost or misplaced\u201d. She said she spent hundreds of pounds on a taxi to Norfolk, on the understanding her car would be dropped to her home once the company had cut new keys. Although the firm said they had cut a new key, she said her old set was returned with the car. \u201cI actually do not know what they did with my car while it was in their care,\u201d Ms Renyard said. She said she had not received any money and was more than \u00a3300 out of pocket, despite being told by Drive Park and Fly that she would be fully reimbursed.\n\nWhen Richard Bowyer returned from his holiday he said the parking firm initially could not find his car\n\nRichard Bowyer said he returned from a family holiday to be told that Drive Park and Fly had \u201cno recollection\u201d of having his car. He booked into a hotel, but with his car still missing the next morning, he had to take a taxi home to Hampshire, costing him about \u00a3400. A week later he said his car was found in the short stay car park, in the exact spot where he had handed it over to a company representative.\n\nAnother holidaymaker, Leon Palma, from Southampton, booked a meet-and-greet with Galaxy Parking Limited. But he said his holiday was interrupted when he received a series of automatically emailed receipts showing his car had entered and left the Gatwick Drop-Off zone six times during the same morning, when he was abroad, at a cost of six pounds each time. Mr Palma said: \u201cIt stressed my holiday, because I\u2019m thinking if anything happens to my car, I\u2019ll get the blame because I am the owner.\" West Sussex Trading Standards said it had received 13 complaints about Galaxy Parking Limited this year and nine relating to Drive Park and Fly since December.\n\nRichard Sargeant from Trading Standards said passengers need to thoroughly check reviews before booking their airport parking\n\nWest Sussex Trading Standards manager Richard Sargeant said we have had issues with different operators for a number of years. \"We've had instances where cars are driven outside the compounds, cars left at supermarket car parks, and customers cars have had speeding tickets. \"This year we have seen customers vehicles being left at the short stay car park and when they return their car hasn't moved at all and the customer has to pay money to get their car released from the car park itself.\" He said people should always look for a \"buy with confidence approved trader\" who has been vetted by trading standards.\n\nNatasha Ferdinand discovered a fine was clocked up by her car while she was away\n\nNatasha Ferdinand, from Somerset, said she thought her experience with Drive Park and Fly had gone smoothly until she was hit with a fine for parking in a no-stopping zone. \u201cThe issue was that the parking meet-and-greet people parked it there, not us\u201d, Ms Ferdinand said. She said she tried to get Drive Park and Fly to cover the \u00a3100 penalty but its staff \u201ceither put the phone down or ignored my emails\".\n\nOliver Bedford, head of car parking at Gatwick Airport, which is not connected to Drive Park and Fly or Galaxy Parking Limited, said passengers needed to do their research. He told the BBC: \"Although there are lots of legitimate companies off-airport and the official Gatwick parking, there are some firms who are not operating in a right and proper manner.\" He said people should be \"extra careful\" looking on comparison websites\" at providers and check their details. \"Do they have independent reviews? Make sure that what you are booking is fully trustworthy,\" he said.",

        "body": "Noise and steam as first blast furnace closes in Port Talbot\n\n24 hours ago By Huw Thomas , Business Correspondent, BBC Wales News Share\n\nConstruction Photography/Avalon The last molten iron will be tapped from Blast Furnace 5 this week\n\nLoud noises and large plumes of steam will be visible above the Port Talbot steelworks as one of its historic furnaces is closed down by Friday. Blast Furnace 5 (BF5) had been operating since 1959, but will shut as part of Tata Steel UK\u2019s restructure. Port Talbot\u2019s other furnace will end production of liquid iron in September ahead of the construction of a greener electric arc furnace next year. Nearby residents have been warned about the sights and sounds connected to the cooling of BF5.\n\nTata Steel UK The furnace had undergone major rebuilding and renovation works to keep operating\n\nTata Steel UK Blast Furnace 5 in 1958, a year before it began producing liquid iron\n\nEarlier this week, engineers began altering the raw ingredients that are poured into the blast furnace in order to prepare for decommissioning. Plumes of steam and some whooshing sounds were expected to be heard ahead of the final tapping of liquid iron on Thursday evening or Friday morning. When the furnace began life in May 1959, it produced 11,800 tonnes a week, peaking in 2009 when it was producing more than 57,000 tonnes a week. Tragedy struck in November 2001 when an explosion killed three steelworkers and severely injured 12 others. Tonnes of molten iron burst from the furnace as the explosion lifted the top of the massive structure into the air. A report blamed the cause of the disaster on water that had come into contact with hot materials in the furnace.\n\nFamily photos Stephen Galsworthy, Andrew Hutin and Len Radford died in the 2001 explosion\n\nThe explosion claimed the lives of Stephen Galsworthy, who was 25, Andrew Hutin, 20, and Len Radford, 53. A \u00a365m rebuilding of the furnace, and upgrades since, had allowed it to continue producing the liquid iron required for Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks. Its closure comes amid a vast restructure of Tata Steel UK\u2019s operations. While BF5 will close this week, Blast Furnace 4 will shut in September and will end Port Talbot\u2019s ability to produce liquid iron from ore.

        "title": "Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?",
        "body": "Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?\n\n6 hours ago By Michael Dempsey , Technology Reporter Share\n\nAerolane Dubbed the \"flying piano\", Aerolane's test aircraft is surfing air currents\n\nUS start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing. Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the \u201cflying piano\u201d because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.\n\nAerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft\u2019s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls \u201ca combination of gliding and surfing\u201d. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350\u2019s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn.\n\nAirbus Airbus has experimented with flying a jet in the wake of another to conserve fuel\n\nMr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years\u2019 experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon\u2019s drone delivery project, on the basis that \u201cthere has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft\". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.\n\nAerolane Aerolane hopes that a glider something like this might one day carry air freight\n\nMr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged outside advisors to be devil\u2019s advocates,\" he adds. He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots. James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something. \u201cIt stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.\u201d However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely. \u201cIt should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.\u201d\n\nFred Lopez Fred Lopez was initially sceptical about Aerolane's prospects",

        "title": "Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?",
        "body": "Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?\n\n6 hours ago By Tom Singleton , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThree decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of \"fulfilment centres\", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. \"For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',\" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. \"It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,\" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by \"living in a cave\".\n\nGetty Images Amazon has used sport to grow its streaming business\n\nSo the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over \"severe\" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: \"What the heck is left?\" \"Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?\" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to \"keep taking swings\" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a \"whole graveyard of bad ideas\" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention \"in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century\", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. \"Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,\" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziuk\u0117nas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. \"It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images Shein and Temu are two of the brands from China that are competing with Amazon",

        "body": "Japan declares victory in 'war' on floppy disks\n\nFloppy disks fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented\n\nIt's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks.\n\nUp until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use.\n\nBut these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono.\n\nIn 2021, Mr Kono had \"declared war\" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: \"We have won the war on floppy disks!\"\n\nMr Kono has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would \"get rid of the fax machine\".\n\nOnce seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change.\n\nFor instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.\n\nThe announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a \"symbol of an anachronistic administration\".\n\n\"The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,\" read another comment on X.\n\nOthers comments were more nostalgic. \u201cI wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nCreated in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.\n\nA three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information.\n\nSony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.\n\nAs part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.\n\nBut Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.\n\nMany Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.\n\nPeople are moving away from those stamps at a \"glacial pace\", said local newspaper The Japan Times.\n\nAnd it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",

        "body": "Ex-Post Office chair denies hiding key Horizon report\n\n2 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nPost Office Horizon IT Inquiry\n\nFormer Post Office chair Tim Parker has denied deliberately hiding a key report he commissioned into the Horizon IT system from members of the Post Office board. The 2016 report, written by former top Treasury lawyer Jonathan Swift, raised concerns about the accounting software which was later found to be faulty. Incorrect data from Horizon led to the wrongful conviction of 700 sub-postmasters for theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015. On Wednesday, an inquiry into the scandal heard that only four copies of the Swift report were made, none of which were shared with the Post Office board or the government. Mr Parker said he had been acting on advice from Post Office lawyers not to share the document.\n\n\"It's one of my regrets that I got this advice and I took it,\" he said. \"Could we have shared it? I wish we had, in a way. \"I've had this report commissioned, I wanted to get some kind of result from it, but then I get this advice.\"\n\nAll subpostmaster convictions have now been quashed, but many people went to prison or lost their businesses. The Swift report was commissioned by the government following a BBC Panorama programme in 2015 that raised concerns about the strength of evidence against those convicted. Although supportive of the Post Office in parts, it raised key concerns about whether the Post Office had enough evidence to bring charges of theft. It also cast doubt over claims that Horizon data could not be altered remotely by Fujitsu, the company that developed the software. This turned out to be untrue, and may have deprived subpostmasters of an important line of defence at their trials. Mr Parker, who became chair of the Post Office in October 2015, and remained in the role until September 2022, told the inquiry that top Post Office lawyer Jane MacLeod had advised him not to share the Swift report because it was legally privileged. That meant it had the same confidential status as communications between a lawyer and a client. Mr Parker said he was told that breaching this could have resulted in the report being made public, and that it needed to be kept within the \"tightly knit\" Post Office legal team.\n\n'I had no vested interest in protecting the Post Office'\n\nWhen challenged by inquiry lead counsel Jason Beer, Mr Parker conceded that by doing this he had prevented the board from discussing the report's findings. However, he said he believed that the Post Office legal team would \"take forward\" the report's recommendations and denied hiding it for improper motives. \"What possible motive would I have had at the time from hiding this report from my fellow board members, other than receiving advice that I shouldn't share it?\" he said. \"Bear in mind I had no axe to grind on this, I had no vested interest in trying to protect the Post Office.\" He continued: \"With hindsight of course, it would appear there were motives perhaps underpinning some of the advice or direction of this that were not wholly fair or right or in the interests of people who'd be wronged. \"At the time, however, it seemed to me that the people giving me advice... were doing this in good faith and it was the right thing to do.\" In later questioning, lawyer Sam Stein said as chair Mr Parker had been \"part time\" and his decisions had been \"part baked\". Mr Parker initially worked one and a half days per week on his Post Office responsibilities, and later dropped this down to half a day per week. But Mr Parker rejected Mr Stein's characterisation, saying: \"I don\u2019t accept that. I gave sufficient time and attention to the Post Office. I\u2019m sorry.\"",

        "body": "Water firms could be sued over sewage after ruling\n\n2 days ago By Lora Jones , BBC Business Share\n\nGetty\n\nWater companies could face a \"flood\" of legal challenges over sewage discharges, lawyers have said, after a landmark Supreme Court ruling. On Tuesday, seven justices at the UK's highest court ruled that the Manchester Ship Canal Company is able to sue United Utilities over the alleged release of raw sewage into the canal. Speaking to the BBC, one lawyer said owners of adjacent waterways or even members of the public could bring claims against other utility companies as a result. Environmental charities said the ruling was good news. It comes at a time when water companies have been under significant financial pressure and scrutiny for unauthorised discharges of waste. The panel of judges found that the Manchester Ship Canal Company was entitled to bring a nuisance or trespass claim for compensation over the release of \"untreated foul water\". It comes despite previous rulings to the contrary in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal, which led to the private company's appeal.\n\nGetty Images Sewage is discharged from overflow points across England\n\nThere are about 100 United Utilities outfalls along the canal, where treated waste is released from the sewerage network. Raw sewage is also dumped when the system is operating over capacity, something the judges said could be avoided if the firm \"invested in improved infrastructure and treatment\". A lengthy legal battle took place between the canal company, owned by the Peel Group, and United Utilities. The water provider argued that only regulators could take action over the spills, with the original 1991 act that privatised the sector providing it with protection. But Paul Greatholder, partner at law firm Russell Cooke, said that the ruling on Tuesday meant the \"floodgates are open\". \"This could bring a range of potential claims from either the owners of adjacent waterways, or even from members of the public who have been made unwell as a consequence,\" he said. Emily Nicholson, partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya said: \"If millions of copycat claims then spring up, that will be a reflection of the utility companies' failures rather than the failure of the courts or legal system.\" She said that those affected by any failures, such as swimmers, fishermen and environmental organisations, now at least have a route to seek redress. Mr Greatholder also suggested that the Supreme Court had put down a \"marker\" for water utility companies in claiming that issues could have been avoided if more investment had gone into improving the canal's infrastructure. \"No doubt the same could be said of all water companies. Thames Water has spent billions of pounds on a \u2018supersewer\u2019 running through London to try to mitigate just this sort of issue,\" he added. Water firms including Thames Water have come under significant scrutiny over their environmental records in recent months. Recent BBC analysis found that every major English water company had reported data suggesting they've discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry - a practice which is potentially illegal. On Tuesday, United Utilities said it \"understood and shared\" concerns about the need to improve, and pointed to a \u00a33bn investment plan aimed at cutting pollution by improving infrastructure.",

        "title": "Student loans: Almost 1.8 million owe more than \u00a350,000",
        "body": "Almost 1.8m people owe \u00a350,000 or more in student debt\n\n3 days ago By Harrison Jones , BBC News Share\n\nBBC The highest debt known to the Student Loan Company now stands at more than \u00a3250,000\n\nAlmost 1.8 million people are now in at least \u00a350,000 of UK student debt, data obtained by BBC News reveals. More than 61,000 have balances of above \u00a3100,000, figures from the Student Loans Company (SLC) also show, while another 50 people each owe upwards of \u00a3200,000. The statistics were released after a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for the number of loan holders with above average debts who are eligible to start repayments. The SLC previously said the average balance for loan holders in England when they start making repayments was less than \u00a345,000. New government data shows that amount has now risen to \u00a348,470. Balances can be significantly higher for those who study multiple or lengthy courses and often rise rapidly with interest. In 2023/24, some 2.8 million people in England made a student loan repayment, according to government figures released after the FOI response. That means only a small fraction of those repaying their balances are in more than \u00a3100,000 of debt - but the majority do owe more than \u00a350,000. It comes after the BBC revealed earlier this year that the highest UK student debt was more than \u00a3231,000. Around three months later, that figure has now hit \u00a3252,000. Tom Allingham, from website Save The Student, said such balances were \"alarming\" but were \u201cin no way indicative of the norm\u201d. Personal finance expert Martin Lewis told the BBC the debts should be seen more like a \"limited form of graduate tax\".\n\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, he explained: \"Student finance for the vast majority of students is not about what you owe, but what you earn - you repay 9% of everything above a threshold.\" For example, those on \"Plan 2 loans\" would pay 9% of everything earned over \u00a327,295. The National Union of Students (NUS) branded it \u201cridiculous\u201d that none of the main parties are offering \"reform\" of student finance in the election campaign. Debts are written off at the end of loan terms, regardless of how much is owed by that point. The terms are often 30 or 40 years, but depend on your course and start date. Heavily-indebted graduates have also spoken to BBC News about their concerns with the current system.\n\nTiti, a senior electrical engineer from Croydon who asked for his full name not to be used, saw his student debt - which stands at more than \u00a3128,200 - rise by \u00a3788.11 between 6 April and 6 June this year. \u201cNo matter how much I pay it is always increasing,\u201d he said, referencing the near 8% interest rate on accounts like his, which is driven by high inflation. The father-of-one, 43, told the BBC he feels it is impossible to pay back the balance in full following his four-year course at London South Bank University and two years studying for a Higher National Diploma. \u201cIt seems like a money-making avenue when you look at the (interest) rates applied to the loans,\u201d he said. Titi said he fears some people may be discouraged from higher education \u201cwhen they do the calculations\u201d and consider what they could earn without a degree.\n\nTiti Titi saw his student debt rise by \u00a3788.11 between 6 April and 6 June\n\nIt is more than 10 years since tuition fees were tripled in England. From 2017, fees have cost a maximum of \u00a39,250 per year across the UK, though in Scotland, Scottish students are charged a maximum of \u00a31,820 and in Northern Ireland, the current maximum tuition fee for full-time undergraduates is \u00a34,710. Many people who borrowed \"exceptional amounts\" on so-called \"Plan 2\" loans - which were introduced when fees were tripled - are unlikely to pay the full amount back, according to Ben Waltmann, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But Claire Callender, a professor of higher education policy and deputy director of the Centre for Global Higher Education, told the BBC that owing such high amounts is \"likely to have a negative impact on graduates' lives\".\n\nIt is not clear whether the largest debt now known to the SLC - of \u00a3252,000 - is on the same loan as the one revealed to be the highest in March, at \u00a3231,000. Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told the BBC he was \"most shocked\" by the number of people in more than \u00a3200,000 of student debt. He pointed out that the data suggests that fewer than 50 people owe at least \u00a310m between them. \"Clearly, at that level, the student loan system is not working well because these people will not pay it all back\", Mr Hillman said.\n\n'People will not pay it all back'\n\nIn its response to the FOI request, the SLC said people with higher than average balances \"may be in receipt of several student loan products\", including an Advanced Learner Loan for further education courses and funding for undergraduate courses, postgraduate Master\u2019s courses and postgraduate Doctoral courses. It said other factors behind high student debts could also include loan holders studying multiple or lengthier courses or holding more than one loan plan type. The company added that some students receive additional funding due to \"compelling personal reasons\". Despite being in more than \u00a3101,500 of debt, foundation year 2 doctor Abbie Tutt is pleased the system does not impact credit scores. But Dr Tutt - who posted a video on social media \"celebrating\" her balance passing \u00a3100,000 - is unhappy about how long she will be paying it off for. The 27-year-old says the debt is saddening when she compares it to that of older colleagues who paid their loans off when terms were more favourable.\n\nAbbie Tutt Dr Abbie Tutt says comparing her debt with that of older colleagues who have paid it off is saddening\n\nShe characterises her debt as a tax. Dr Tutt told the BBC: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to uni because it\u2019s your passion and you are going to get a good job and be happy then you could justify it. \u201cBut I am not comfortable with people being in that much debt and not getting a job.\u201d\n\n'Ridiculous'",

        "body": "Union calls off Port Talbot steel workers' strike\n\n4 days ago By Simon Jack and Faarea Masud , BBC Business Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Unite union has called off a strike planned for 8 July so that further talks can take place over the future of the UK\u2019s largest steel works at Port Talbot in Wales. Owners Tata had been planning to shut one blast furnace at the site in September and one this Thursday, but then threatened to shut both this week due to safety fears over a staff walkout. Unite\u2019s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closures and hasten job losses. The Community and GMB unions had hoped that waiting until blast furnace four closed in September would give them time for more negotiations to extend its life, with a potentially new government in place.\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said the talks were \"essential\". \"Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste,\" she said, saying the focus should be on fresh investment and the continuation of long-term steel making in the region.\n\nTata has been in talks with unions since January when it unveiled plans to radically transform its south Wales operations to deal with financial losses and to reduce its carbon emissions. With government help, the steel giant plans to build a new electric arc furnace that recycles scrap metal and is less energy intensive - a move it says will secure the future of steel making at the site. However, it would need far fewer staff and require the closure of the two existing furnaces at Port Talbot, resulting in 2,800 job losses. Extending the life of one of them would save 2,000 of those jobs if the remaining blast furnace was left on until the new electric arc furnace has been built on the site, which could take up to three years.\n\n'Dangerous game'\n\nUnite, which had pulled out of the talks, was already taking industrial action such as banning overtime and was due to stage an all-out strike from next Monday. However, last week Tata threatened to close both furnaces within days unless it could \"safely and stably operate\" them during the strike. It then wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the action was called off.\n\nOther unions have welcomed the news but have criticised Unite for giving Tata an excuse to shut the furnaces early. Sources familiar with the situation accused the union of \u201cplaying a very dangerous game of brinkmanship with everyone's jobs\u201d. But Unite officials rejected the claims, saying their action \u201chad helped focus minds\u201d. They are also claiming a victory of sorts over the news that further talks will take place after the election. However, in a letter to unions from Tata - seen by the BBC - it is clear the company had already agreed to further talks after the upcoming election.\n\n'Nothing but chaos'",

        "title": "High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide",
        "body": "High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide\n\n4 days ago By Nick Edser , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nHigh mortgage rates mean affordability is still \"stretched\" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been \"broadly stable\" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now \u00a3266,064, the lender said.\n\nPrices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been \"broadly flat\" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are \"still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic\". \"For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. \"As a result, housing affordability is still stretched.\" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.\n\nDespite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. \"Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. \"Either way, we\u2019re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.\"\n\nLast week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about \u00a3180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to \u00a31.2bn in May, from \u00a32.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.\n\nWays to make your mortgage more affordable",

        "title": "Energy price cap change mean lower bills but relief may be temporary",
        "body": "Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\n\n4 days ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\n\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \u00a31,723 in October, a \u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\n\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\n\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\n\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\n\nLatest changes in detail\n\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\n\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\n\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \u00a31,522\n\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \u00a31,668\n\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\n\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down",

        "body": "Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer\n\n4 days ago By Jo\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\n\nGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they \"strenuously object to this plea deal\"\n\nA lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a \"sweetheart plea deal\". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information \"directly from the Justice Department\", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.\n\n'Families will object to this deal'\n\nLast month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. \"The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\" said Mr Cassell, adding that the \"families will strenuously object to this plea deal\". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (\u00a319.6bn) for \"the deadliest corporate crime in US history\". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to \"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations\".",

        "body": "M&S to launch clothing repairs service\n\n6 days ago By Liv McMahon , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at \u00a35. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.\n\nSojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. \u201cThrough the launch of our repair service, we\u2019re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,\" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.\n\nSojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream\n\nJosephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked \"an incredibly big step\" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.\n\nGrowing trend among retailers\n\nM&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London\u2019s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.\n\n'Regulatory pressures'",

        "title": "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry",
        "body": "What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\n\n6 days ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\n\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\n\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \"individual problems\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \"working well\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \"with hindsight would have done things differently\".\n\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\n\nMr Jenkins was an \u201cexpert witness\u201d in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software \u2013 even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn\u2019t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an \u201ceasy-to-understand way\u201d. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had \u201cno recollection of having been briefed\u201d on his duties and had \u201cclearly forgotten\u201d about having seen the letter.\n\n3. He knew remote access was possible\n\nThe former \"distinguished engineer\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access \u2013 the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \"informal chats\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\n\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\n\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially \u201cvery damaging\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a \u201cwilling actor\u201d in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used \u201cless emotive words\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to \u201ctweak\u201d his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a \u201ctidying up\u201d to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\n\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\n\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \u201cbetter with systems than people\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.",

In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: \"They suspend closure, we suspend action.\"\n\nUnite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata\u2019s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs. The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September. Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could \"safely and stably operate\" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community\u2019s national officer, said the letter \"simply reaffirms\" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action. Mr Davies said it was \"welcome\" Unite were \"reaffirming their commitment to the position they previously agreed\", that unions would agree on a memorandum of understanding before putting it to members to vote on.\n\nGetty Images Tata has previously said it is losing \u00a31m a day in Port Talbot",

        "title": "Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?",
        "body": "Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?\n\n1 day ago By MaryLou Costa , Business reporter Share\n\nHannu Rauma Hannu Rauma says that using AI to help him manage has \"added years to my life\"\n\nWith the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll, Hannu Rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated. \u201cI was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams, and feeling this disappointment,\u201d says Mr Rauma, who is based in Vancouver, Canada. He is a senior manager at a company called Student Marketing Agency, which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses. \u201cWhen I was bringing new clients on board, half of my mind would be saying, \u2018we're going to screw up\u2019, and it would dampen my enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Rauma says that all changed from last November, when the firm began using an autonomous AI manager developed by US-based company Inspira. The AI manager helps the agency\u2019s employees, who work flexible hours remotely, to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance. It checks their timekeeping, sends them deadline reminders and regular check-in messages, and records the time spent on different clients, so the latter can be billed accurately. The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone\u2019s work progress in a central portal. Mr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. \u201cI'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,\u201d he says. Mr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. \u201cBefore, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we\u2019re able to have more light-hearted discussions.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts. Participants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager. The AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas. Yet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success. Despite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.\n\nGetty Images Dell is one firm that has cut jobs in the face of the rise of AI\n\nWhile businesses like UPS, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake. \u201cThe middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,\u201d says the professor of management. \u201cThey're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching\u2026 all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.\u201d AI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines. AI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition. But companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,\u201d says Prof Thurman. \u201cYou want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.\u201d\n\nAI managers can also help people who have become \u201caccidental managers\u201d - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat. \u201cWe did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management. \u201cSome of them said they didn\u2019t like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn\u2019t know what was expected of them or if they were doing a good job,\u201d says Ms Rahman. \u201cYou'd assume that an AI manager would be built to give those correct instructions, to give complete transparency on the requirements, and the outcomes. People are likely to be more productive when they know what's expected of them.\u201d But an over-reliance on AI management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people, Ms Rahman warns. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for a business to tell their employees that they\u2019re introducing this brand new AI system that's going to completely manage them, then say, with the same face, that \u2018we care about your experiences in the workplace,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nJames Bore",

        "title": "How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple",
        "body": "How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple\n\n2 days ago By Zoe Kleinman , Technology editor Share\n\nGetty Images Under Jensen Huang's leadership Nvidia has seen its share price soar\n\nLife comes at you fast. Last month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world\u2019s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple. When this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience. As I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (\u00a32.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft. Two things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight. Microsoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene. Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom \u2013 and so far, it\u2019s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?\n\nThis year\u2019s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech. I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement. \u201cWe thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],\u201d she told me. \u201cBut with AI, we are throwing the dice again\u201d. She believes she\u2019s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in. That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It\u2019s a confidential event, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI. A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. \u201cMost stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,\u201d it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup\u2019s \u201cAI winners basket\u201d had fallen in value in 2024. Life comes at you fast indeed.\n\nGetty Images Anne Boden says that AI has completely shaken up the tech sector\n\n\u201cGiven how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,\u201d warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cJust like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.\u201d In 2023 you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI. My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches. \u201cI spend a lot of time saying \u2018\u2026 but that\u2019s not AI\u2019,\u201d he tells me. It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.\n\nSpeaking to the FT, Citi\u2019s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, \u201cjust saying AI 15 times isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore\u201d. In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that\u2019s just plain weird. And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now \u2013 early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,\u201d says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar. \u201cBusinesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill \u2013 the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.\u201d Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. \u201cThe bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,\u201d he says. But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon. \u201cEveryone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,\u201d he adds. \u201cAll the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.\u201d\n\nGetty Images ChatGPT is the AI app that has really caught the public's attention",

        "title": "The fastest data in the world",
        "body": "The fastest data in the world\n\n3 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nsurf Mission accomplished for Edwin Verheul (left) and Joachim Opdenakker\n\nIn February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest science experiment \u2013 two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button. Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. \u201cThere was high-fiving involved,\u201d recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. \u201cIt was super-cool to see.\u201d He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands. A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) \u2013 or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists\u2019 access to the results of LHC experiments. A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable. \u201cThis transponder that Nokia uses, it\u2019s like a celebrity,\u201d says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. \u201cWe had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.\u201d This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still \u2013 they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.\n\nNokia & Surf After its upgrade the Large Hadron Collider will produce five times as much data\n\nIn labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection. This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster. The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. \u201cDue to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,\u201d explains Mr Opdenakker. Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data \u2013 about one petabyte per second. That\u2019s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs. This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today. \u201cThe upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,\u201d says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.\n\nA time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That\u2019s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work. In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors. He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores \u2013 a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people\u2019s home to the internet.\n\nBut older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That\u2019s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection. \u201cI think it\u2019s a world best, we don\u2019t know of any results that are better than that,\u201d says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line. For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself. Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030. But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. \u201cFor remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles\u2026 you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,\u201d says Mr Creaner. Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues. And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: \u201cHumanity finds a way of consuming it.\u201d\n\nTeleGeography Demand for bandwidth is growing surprisingly fast says Lane Burdette",
