Santiago/Getty Images\n\nLast week, there were an estimated 238,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment benefits, an increase of 4,000 from the week before, according to Department of Labor data released Wednesday. The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023.\n\nAlso, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021.\n\nLuke Tilley, Wilmington Trust\u2019s chief economist, told CNN he is closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment.\n\n\u201cOn a three-month average basis, it\u2019s up about 200,000 people from last year,\u201d Tilley said. \u201cAnd that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion. It was never positive between 2010 and 2019; it was not positive in between the tech crash recession of 2001 and then 2008.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo when you sort of peel back the onion from what looks like very strong job growth in a raw number count and look at it a little closer \u2026 that paints a labor market that has normalized and is at risk of slipping.\u201d\n\nStill, other measures of layoff activity haven\u2019t shown a worrisome spike.\n\nUS-based employers announced fewer job cuts last month than they did in May; however, those layoff reports are trending well above last year\u2019s, according to data released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nThe outplacement and workplace research firm counted 48,786 cuts announced in June.

        "body": "CNN \u2014\n\n2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon.\n\nEarlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It\u2019s due to set sail in February 2025.\n\nWith stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, \u201cThe Big Nude Boat\u201d is billed as a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d with amenities designed to \u201cfit everyone\u2019s style of bare cruising.\u201d\n\nAnd couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area.\n\nThe news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach.\n\n\u201cNudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Nudist explains what you should definitely not do at a nude beach 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.\n\n\u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d\n\nWhile clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era.\n\nDuring the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d\n\nChanneling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.\n\nOne of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world.\n\nAnd their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:\n\nPlaya Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay\n\nLocated about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay\u2019s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.\n\nPhotogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand\u2019s allure.\n\nAfter decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.\n\nSince then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort.\n\nPlaya Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay\n\nNida Nude Beach, Lithuania\n\nThe chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off.\n\nWith its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.\n\nWalk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.\n\nNida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania\n\nAgesta Beach, Sweden\n\nSweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.\n\nBased in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city.\n\nOpen from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available.\n\nAgesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden\n\nLittle Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand\n\nLittle Palm Beach is situated on Waiheke Island in New Zealand. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAlthough it\u2019s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation\u2019s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.\n\nReaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island\u2019s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.\n\nYou can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke\u2019s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.\n\nLittle Palm Beach, Miro Road, Waiheke Island 1081, New Zealand\n\nNugal Beach, Croatia\n\nFlanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Bra\u010d island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.\n\nBe sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair \u2014 like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.\n\nNugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tu\u010depi.\n\nNugal Beach, 21300 Makarska, Croatia\n\nMoshup Beach, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts\n\nMoshup Beach can be found on the west side of Martha's Vineyard. Loop Images/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty Images\n\nPerched at the island\u2019s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).\n\nLocated right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.\n\nMoshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island\u2019s private nude beach.\n\nMoshup Beach, 71 Moshup Trail, Aquinnah, MA 02535\n\nBlack\u2019s Beach, La Jolla, California\n\nSet beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State\u2019s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.\n\nLong, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from La Jolla Farms Road or the Citizens Trail from Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego.\n\nBlack\u2019s Beach, Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, San Diego, CA 92037\n\nLady Bay Beach, Sydney, Australia\n\nLady Bay Beach was first granted legal status in 1976. Evelyn Proimos/Flickr\n\nAlthough it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)\n\nPerched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it\u2019s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.\n\nThe rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.\n\nLady Bay Beach, Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney, Australia\n\nBuhne 16, Sylt, Germany\n\n\u201cGrin and bare it\u201d might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).\n\nTechnically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.\n\nIt\u2019s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.\n\nBuhne 16, Listlandstr 133b, 25980 Kampen (Sylt), German\n\nWreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada\n\nBilled as one of the world\u2019s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.\n\nWith the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.\n\nEvergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.\n\nWreck Beach, Vancouver, British Columbia; Canada\n\nRed Beach, Crete, Greece\n\nThis secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.\n\nNamed after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront.\n\nPioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni\u2019s that\u2019s renowned for its mojitos.\n\nNote: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.\n\nRed Beach, Matala, Crete 702 00, Greece\n\nCallantsoog Beach, Netherlands\n\nCallantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.\n\nSituated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.\n\nIts designated nudist section is marked between two poles.\n\nThose keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe.\n\nCallantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands\n\nAnse de Grande Saline, St. Barts\n\nWhile the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.)\n\nAnse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.\n\nL\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over.\n\nAnse de Grande Saline, St. Barth\u00e9lemy\n\nPlatja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain\n\nSet between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza\u2019s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.\n\nHowever nude sunbathers aren\u2019t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you\u2019ll see pacing in the background aren\u2019t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.\n\nPlatja des Cavallet, 07818, Balearic Islands, Spain\n\nLittle Beach, Maui, Hawaii\n\nLittle Beach -- a clothing-optional beach in Maui's Makena State Park. Shutterstock\n\nFlanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you didn\u2019t take your clothes off. Like many such beaches, going sans swimsuit is not officially sanctioned here and citations are possible.\n\nPart of Makena State Park on the island\u2019s southeast coast, the beach overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.\n\nGnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.\n\nAdditionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets.\n\nLittle Beach, Makena State Park, Makena Rd, Kihei, HI 96753, USA\n\nCap d\u2019Agde beach, France\n\nCap d'Agde -- an iconic nudist resort town in Southern France. Shutterstock\n\nSometimes called the \u201cNaked City,\u201d Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village is the world\u2019s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season.\n\nVisitors are free to be naked wherever they want \u2013 restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).\n\nNon residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.\n\nCap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village, Rond-Point du Bagnas, 34300 Agde, France\n\nIs Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy\n\nSituated along Sardinia\u2019s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment.\n\nThe idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years.\n\nMayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future.\n\n\u201cWe have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,\u201d Tedeschi told CNN. \u201cAnd then we thought, let\u2019s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.\u201d\n\nThe beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby.\n\nIs Benas Beach, Province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy\n\nMpenjati Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nMpenjati Beach was awarded official nudist beach status in 2014. Rajesh Jantilal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s only official nude beach \u2013 and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent \u2013 is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.\n\nIts legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.\n\nLocal clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation.\n\nMpenjati Nature Reserve, Palm Beach, Port Edward, South Africa\n\nPlaya Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico\n\nZipolite Beach in Mexican is tolerant of nude sunbathing. Shutterstock\n\nLive your \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal were shot on location.\n\nPioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn\u2019t legal here.)\n\nWhile the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy.\n\nPlaya Zipolite, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico\n\nMetsoke Dragot, Israel\n\nFloat nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.\n\nPerhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour\u2019s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline.\n\nPrimitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.\n\nMetsoke Dragot, Highway 90, Dead Sea, Israel\n\nPraia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil\n\nNaturist beach Praia Massarandupi\u00f3 in Bahia. Fred Schinke/Flickr\n\nThe string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.\n\nA two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.\n\nPraia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil\n\nSpiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy\n\nSpiaggia de Guvano has been popular with nude bathers since the 1960s. Shutterstock\n\nLocated on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think \u201cSwept Away \u201d \u2013 the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller.)\n\nAdding to the beach\u2019s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via kayak or motorboat or hiking down a steep and somewhat treacherous trail that involves scrambling over rocks.\n\nGuvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit.\n\nThe beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.\n\nSpiaggia di Guvano, 19018 Vernazza, SP, Italy\n\nVecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia\n\nEdged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.\n\nBased close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it\u2019s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section.\n\nThe zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that\u2019s a big hit with local residents.\n\nVecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia\n\nHaulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida\n\nThe most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.\n\nThe clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.\n\nGiven the stellar weather in south Florida, there\u2019s usually someone in the buff on any given day.\n\nBut the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.\n\nHaulover Beach Park, 10800 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33154\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated and republished in May 2024.",

Angie Craig, D-Minn., officially called on Biden to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n\"This is not a decision I've come to lightly, but there is simply too much at stake to risk a second Donald Trump presidency,\" Craig said in a statement on Saturday morning. \"That's why I respectfully call on President Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee for a second term as President and allow for a new generation of leaders to step forward.\"\n\nCraig is now the fifth House Democrat to call on Biden to exit. Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Il., made his own announcement during an MSNBC interview Friday, just before the full ABC News 22-minute interview aired.\n\nThey join a growing choir of Democratic lawmakers, donors and strategists losing faith in Biden's ability to wage a successful campaign against Trump. Reps. Lloyd Doggett, D-Tx. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, D-Ariz. and Seth Moulton, D-Mass. have also publicly called on Biden to step down.\n\n\"The president is rightfully proud of his record,\" said David Axelrod, who served as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama, after the ABC News interview aired. \"But he is dangerously out-of-touch with the concerns people have about his [capacities] moving forward and his standing in this race.\"\n\nEarlier this week, former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., some of Biden's closest allies, publicly validated concerns about Biden's fitness for reelection. Pelosi, for example, said it was \"legitimate\" to ask whether Biden's debate performance was simply a one-off episode or representative of a more long-term condition.\n\nBoth Pelosi and Clyburn noted that they still support the president as he vies for a second term.",

        "title": "Southwest Airlines shareholders puzzled by Elliott's activism can look to past campaigns for insight",
        "body": "In this article LUV\n\nSU\n\nMPC Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nTravelers wait to check in at the Southwest Airlines counter at Oakland International Airport in Oakland, California, Dec. 27, 2022. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAfter Elliott Management revealed a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines in June, an initial rally in the stock quickly fizzled. Rather than sparking typical cheer on Wall Street, Elliott's campaign, spelled out in a 50-page presentation, led to confusion and concern among investors and customers. The hedge fund has taken activist stakes in more than 140 companies over the past three decades, according to data from 13D Monitor, but, like most activist investors, it has never targeted an airline. Southwest, a Dallas-based company that started flying in 1971, has a unique culture that's survived profitably for decades in a bruising industry. While the company is suffering from margin deterioration and has seen its stock drop in each of the past four years, Elliott's demand that Southwest fire CEO Bob Jordan and oust Chairman Gary Kelly has raised questions about whether the activist fully understands Southwest's insular culture and the industry's glacial pace of change. Elliott hasn't publicly specified changes it wants within Southwest's offerings, calling instead for a business review. \"We are not entirely sure what Elliott has in mind,\" analysts at Melius Research wrote in a report on June 10, the day the firm launched its campaign. \"Until we know more, we are sticking with our Sell rating.\" Southwest has taken steps to defend itself. On Wednesday, the airline adopted a so-called poison pill that would activate if any shareholder acquired an interest of more than 12.5%, limiting Elliott's ability to attain more control. Elliott says it currently has an interest of about 11% of the company. Despite the potential wrinkle introduced by Southwest's latest move, history offers some clues as to how this will play out. Several activism experts pointed to two of Elliott's past targets for insight into the hedge fund's strategy for Southwest: Suncor Energy in 2022 and Marathon Petroleum in 2019. Elliott partner John Pike, who is now leading the Southwest campaign, was involved in the firm's actions at both energy companies. While Suncor and Marathon resisted Elliott's proposals, including leadership change and business reviews, Elliott still got much of what it wanted.\n\nwatch now\n\nElliott's activist practice has helped it become one of the most successful hedge funds in the world, surpassing $65 billion in assets. The firm, which moved its headquarters in 2020 from New York to West Palm Beach, Florida, has only had two losing years in five decades. It often pushes companies to make dramatic changes, such as selling off businesses, firing executives or abandoning strategic plans. In recent years, however, Elliott has also shown it can work collaboratively with management. Representatives have joined the boards of companies including Pinterest and Etsy . Texas Instruments CEO Haviv Ilan said in May that his company was open to \"constructive dialogue\" with Elliott, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he had \"thoroughly enjoyed getting to know\" the Elliott team after the firm dropped plans to nominate directors at the software company in 2023. Southwest said in a brief response to Elliott's presentation that it's \"thoughtfully reviewing\" the June 10 letter from the hedge fund and looks forward to \"further conversations with Elliott.\" Southwest also said it's confident in its strategy and its team and is \"focused on restoring our industry-leading financial performance.\" Jordan said he has no plans to resign. Pike and portfolio manager Bobby Xu are leading Elliott's Southwest campaign. Elliott and Southwest representatives met in person in Dallas two weeks ago, according to people familiar with the matter. The discussions remain in the early stages, said the people, who asked not to be named because the conversations were private. The airline has tapped Bank of America and law firm Vinson & Elkins to advise it, another person familiar with the situation said. Southwest shares are down slightly since Elliott announced its involvement, despite a 7% jump on the day of the disclosure. They fell 5.7% on Friday to close at $26.94. Southwest did not provide a comment for this story.\n\nA sprint and Marathon\n\nwatch now\n\nIn April 2022, when Elliott revealed a stake in Suncor, it pointed to a culture that had become overly bureaucratic, leading to an operational slump and a string of worker deaths under CEO Mark Little. \"We have considerable respect for Suncor,\" Elliott's Pike wrote, in calling for management review. Investors were initially wary of Elliott's demands, which included selling off Suncor's Petro-Canada gas stations. Little pushed back initially, but his boardroom support evaporated when another worker was killed weeks after Elliott announced its stake. Little resigned, and the Canadian company soon struck a deal with Elliott, offering three board seats to the hedge fund and conceding to a strategic review \u2014 meaning a potential sale \u2014 of its Petro-Canada gas stations. It was a middle-of-the-road resolution. The company decided after the review not to sell its Petro-Canada business. But it also brought in as CEO an outsider, in longtime Exxon Mobil executive Rich Kruger. At Southwest, Elliott sees a top job that would be similarly appealing to industry executives from other airlines, according to a person familiar with the firm's thinking.\n\nA Suncor Energy facility in Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada, Aug. 21, 2019. Candace Elliott | Reuters\n\nWhile its Suncor effort ended in a relatively quick victory, Elliott's experience with Marathon highlighted the firm's willingness to be patient. Elliott first amassed a stake in the oil producer in 2016 and asked Marathon to \"evaluate\" breaking up the company. Like Suncor, Marathon ran a review and opted to stay intact, keeping its Speedway gas stations as part of the business. But in 2018, a few months after reaching an agreement with Elliott, Marathon announced it was only getting bigger. The company agreed to buy rival Andeavor in a $23 billion deal. Elliott responded to what it viewed as a broken promise by reviving its activist campaign in 2019, picking up a new 2.5% position and proclaiming that it would make sure the \"right leadership\" was in place. \"While the Company assured shareholders that it was pursuing a full review of the Speedway business, it had a different agenda entirely,\" Elliott's Pike wrote in the 2019 letter. Weeks later, Marathon's board said CEO Gary Heminger would retire and that the company would finally spin off Speedway. Elliott reportedly insisted the board find an outsider to replace Heminger. In March 2020, Marathon hired 38-year industry veteran Mike Hennigan as CEO. Speedway was sold to 7-Eleven's parent company for $21 billion in 2020, months after Hennigan took the post, and the company later announced a $7.1 billion buyback program. Years after its victories at Marathon and Suncor, Elliott remains a top five shareholder at both companies.\n\nwatch now\n\nElliott is now one of the top investors in Southwest. One major shareholder, Artisan Partners , has expressed its support for Elliott's campaign. Southwest's bylaws allow big shareholders to call a special meeting to replace its board, something Elliott could consider doing further down the road, though the firm hasn't said if it plans to mount a proxy fight. Whether or not shareholders decide to back Elliott's push, history shows they will benefit. Elliott-targeted companies tend to outperform the market, according to a 13D Monitor analysis. The hedge fund holds on to its positions for two years on average, according to the data. Elliott said its plan can help Southwest's share price jump 77% in 12 months to $49. The poison pill Southwest introduced this week could complicate matters. It's normally adopted by companies fending off a takeover bid. In this case, it limits Elliott's ability to amass more control and also suggests that Southwest's management isn't interested in rolling over. In the press release announcing the plan, Kelly said the airline \"remains open to any ideas for lasting value creation\" but said adopting the poison pill was part of the board's \"fiduciary duties to all shareholders.\" The measure would allow all shareholders, \"other than the person or group triggering\" the plan, to buy stock at a 50% discount to the market price if any person or group acquired 12.5% or more of the company's outstanding stock. Elliott, which has dealt with poison pills in the past, hasn't made clear where it plans to go with its campaign. The firm isn't currently pursuing specific changes that would affect things such as Southwest's baggage policy, according to a person familiar with its plans. Southwest is the only domestic carrier that allows every passenger to check two bags for free, a major customer perk, particularly for those who fly with family members. But a refreshed board and business review could lead to scrutiny of some of Southwest's popular offerings.\n\nUnion challenges\n\nThere are some key differentiating factors for Southwest when compared with Suncor and Marathon. For one, Southwest hasn't made a notable acquisition since 2011 and doesn't have any adjacent businesses to spin out. Another potential hurdle is union influence, which makes it harder for management to implement significant changes, particularly when they involve layoffs and other cost cuts. More than 80% of Southwest's employees belong to a union, and there are separate organizations for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. In all, workers are represented by at least 11 unions, according to the airline's website. Leadership from the 11,000-member Southwest Airlines Pilots Association met with the Elliott team in Dallas in June. The group conducted an \"in-depth analysis\" on Elliott's \"actionable plans and timelines,\" labor leaders said in a message obtained by CNBC. \"In very simple terms, this has the potential to be one of the most significant events in Southwest Airlines' history,\" SWAPA leaders wrote of the activist campaign. Southwest has previously acknowledged some of the problems Elliott highlighted, including system failures that led to thousands of cancellations and left millions of passengers stranded during the 2022 winter holidays. But financial challenges persist. Last week, Southwest cut its second-quarter revenue forecast. The company cited \"complexities in adapting\" its business to \"current booking patterns in this dynamic environment.\" According to Elliott, it's all part of a pattern that justifies activist intervention. \"Southwest is led by a team that has proven unable to adapt to the modern airline industry,\" Pike and Xu said in a statement. \"This is yet another example that fundamental leadership change is urgently needed at Southwest.\" \u2014 CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Demonstrators take part in a rally against the far right following the announcement of the results of the first round of the French parliamentary elections at Place de la Republique in Paris on June 30, 2024. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\n\"We're scared of what might happen,\" Amel, 34, told CNBC ahead of the final round of voting in France's snap election this weekend. The vote is being closely watched by all quarters of French society to see if the nationalist, anti-immigration National Rally (RN) builds on its initial win in the first round of voting, or whether centrist and leftwing parties have been able to thwart the party's chances of entering government. \"It's a very, very tense time. And it's the first time that the far right is winning at the first turn [the first round of the ballot]. So it's a very big deal,\" Amel, a therapist who said she will vote for the leftwing New Popular Front, added. \"We are very anxious and we are trying to get everyone to vote, trying to tell people who don't vote to go and vote, and to try to convince people who vote for the extreme right that they are not a good answer [to France's problems].\" France's far-right RN rejects the \"extremist\" label, saying it stands up for French values, culture and citizens at a time when many are fed up with France's political establishment that's been led by President Emmanuel Macron since 2017. But RN's opponents and critics warn France is on the brink of a political catastrophe if an overtly anti-immigration, nationalist and euroskeptic party wins a majority in this snap election called by Macron after his party lost heavily against the hard-right in European Parliament elections in June. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has said French voters now have a \"moral duty\" to halt the party's advance. For young, left-leaning voters like Amel, RN's surge in voter polls, and the fact it won the most votes in the first round of the election last weekend, are worrying developments that make them fear for France's societal cohesion.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"I am worried about the country's future. I think it's getting worse and worse,\" Amel, who preferred to only give her first name due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said. \"It's going be like a kind of civil war. I hope it will not reach that, but people will just not mix anymore and will be scared of each other. And this is very scary.\" The snap election has thrown the country's political polarization into sharp relief as polls ahead of the final round of voting on Sunday imply a deeply divided nation. The first round of the election resulted in the far-right RN winning 33% of the vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) garnering 28% and the coalition of parties supporting Macron (Ensemble, or Together) winning 20% of the vote.\n\nLeft wing supporters react as the results of the first round of French parliamentary elections are announced in Nantes, western France on June 30, 2024. Sebastien Salom-gomis | Afp | Getty Images\n\nSince the results of the first ballot, parties on the center-right and left have gone all-out to prevent RN's advance in the second ballot, aiming to prevent a parliamentary majority for the party at all costs. Joining forces in a so-called \"Republican Front,\" centrists and leftwing parties have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where one of their candidates was better placed to beat the RN. By offering voters a starker choice and fewer options, the anti far-right front hopes that the electorate will vote for the non-RN candidate. Whether it will work remains to be seen and analysts point out that French voters might not take kindly to being directed how to vote, or who to vote for.\n\nThe elections are a 'mess'\n\nThe final result on Sunday evening \u2014 the outcome of a snap election Macron did not need to call \u2014 will show just how hard it could be to find a consensus in national politics and government going forward. How the nation will react to the result is also uncertain. France is no stranger to civil unrest given the widespread \"Yellow Vest\" anti-government movement of recent years, and street protests since the first round of voting on June 30. France's Interior Ministry appears to be preparing for more trouble after Sunday's poll, reportedly ready to deploy around 30,000 officers across France on Sunday night amid fears of violence after polls close. Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin is reported to have said 5,000 police would be on duty in Paris and its surrounding areas to \"ensure that the radical right and radical left do not take advantage of the situation to cause mayhem.\" France's police force has, at times, been accused of being heavy-handed with demonstrators during previous periods of unrest, firing water cannon and tear gas at \"yellow vest\" demonstrators in 2019.\n\n\n\nTension rises as demonstrators gather in Place de la Republique, to protest against the rising right-wing movement after the Rassemblement National's victory in the first round of early general elections in Paris, France on June 30, 2024. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\n\nA member of the gendarmerie, France's military force in charge of law enforcement and public order, told CNBC that the \"French elections are a mess\" and that the \"public divide has rarely been so flagrant in France.\" \"People's opinions are becoming more and more divided and this is felt in everyday life,\" the gendarme, who asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of his job, told CNBC. The officer \u2014 a father of three who's in his 40s, and a right-leaning voter \u2014 said the polarization in French society was \"very worrying, but unfortunately normal with the 'diversity' of our society.\" \"More and more people with different values and educations are being forced to co-exist, and this clearly doesn't work,\" the officer, who works in Bordeaux in southwestern France, said. \"I am worried about the country's future, because we are too generous to people who aren't willing to integrate and contribute to our society, this can not last.\" The police officer said he expected civil unrest after the vote, whichever party gained the most votes. \"There will be civil unrest whoever is elected, this is France and the people speak their mind.\"\n\nCivil unrest possible\n\nPolitical experts agree that the current febrile atmosphere of French politics, and antagonism between the main bodies of voters, are the ingredients for further civil unrest. \"You've got here all the recipe for a super-polarized political scene and that, of course, translates into civil society as a whole,\" Philippe Marli\u00e8re, professor of French and European politics at University College London, told CNBC. \"If you've got only 33-34% of people voting for the far-right it means the rest is wary of that, or completely opposed to it, so that will translate on every level of politics \u2014 institutional politics, party politics, the National Assembly, but also in society. You will have a very polarized society in which younger people, ethnic minorities, women, and in particular feminists, would be very worried,\" he said. Marli\u00e8re did not discount the possibility of violence on the streets if a far-right party was elected to government. \"We're not there yet. But if there are very unpopular, very antagonizing and very hostile policies to some groups, there will be demonstrations on a scale that you have unrest in the street,\" he said.\n\nUnknown entity\n\nLike other hard-right parties in Europe, the National Rally has tapped into voter insecurities regarding crime, immigration, national identity and economic insecurity. RN's 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella has told voters he will \"restore order,\" curb immigration and tackle delinquency but he and party figurehead Marine Le Pen have rowed back on some of their more strident promises and rhetoric, back-pedaling over taking France out of NATO, for example, and moderating the party's traditionally pro-Russian stance. Bardella said he would still support the sending of arms to Ukraine but not the deployment of ground troops, as Macron suggested was a possibility.\n\nMarine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella at the final rally before the June 9 European Parliament election, held at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nIt's uncertain how many of National Rally's policies would be enacted even if the party made it into government. The \"Republican Front\" also appears confident ahead of the second round of voting that its strategy to hurt the RN's vote share is working. An opinion poll published by Ifop on July 3 suggested voters might tend toward a centrist pro-Macron or leftwing candidate rather than the RN candidate if that is the choice they are presented with on the ballot paper on Sunday. If the choice was between a far-left and far-right candidate, however, the picture was more nuanced, showing a split vote.\n\nwatch now",

        "title": "Nvidia CEO built a $3 trillion company with this leadership philosophy: \u2018No task is beneath me\u2019",
        "body": "A good leader can't be afraid to get their hands dirty, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nLong before he co-founded the computer chip giant, which is currently worth more than $3.1 trillion, Huang was a teenaged busboy working at Denny's. Years later, he would hatch the idea for Nvidia with his co-founders in a booth at the same Denny's where he'd once cleared tables, washed dishes and even cleaned toilets.\n\nDespite boasting a net worth that Forbes estimates at nearly $108 billion, Huang says those humble beginnings still shape the type of business leader he is today.\n\n\"To me, no task is beneath me because, remember, I used to be a dishwasher [and] I used to clean toilets,\" Huang said in a March interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\n\"I mean, I cleaned a lot of toilets,\" he added, telling a room full of students: \"I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined \u2014 and, some of them you just can't unsee.\"\n\nOf course, there's a big difference between being a teen restaurant employee and running a multitrillion-dollar company. But, Huang says he still tries to approach his job today with a similar willingness to take on anything if he believes he can help his employees improve the company, regardless of whether that task could be delegated to someone else.\n\n\"If you send me something and you want my input on it and I can be of service to you \u2014 and, in my review of it, share with you how I reasoned through it \u2014 I've made a contribution to you,\" Huang said.\n\nHuang is a famously hands-on boss, with some employees calling him \"demanding\" and a \"perfectionist.\" He asks employees across the company to email him each week with the five most important things they're working on, and then Huang sometimes even strolls up to employees' desks to ask them how projects are going and weigh in with suggestions, according to a profile in the New Yorker.\n\nWhenever possible, the longtime CEO likes to show his employees his reasoning for a suggestion or solution he offers. Doing so helps the company in the long run, and Huang also finds it personally rewarding and an opportunity to learn new things himself, he told the audience at Stanford.\n\n\"I show people how to reason through things all the time: strategy things, how to forecast something, how to break a problem down,\" he said. \"You're empowering people all over the place.\"\n\nHe tries to wrap up his most complicated work early in the day, so if anyone needs something from him the rest of the day, he can \"always say, 'I have plenty of time.' And I do,\" Huang said in a commencement speech at the California Institute of Technology last month.\n\nAnd, while many CEOs try to limit the number of people who directly report to them to a handful of employees to free up their management schedule, Huang actually prefers to have roughly \"50 direct reports,\" he told CNBC in November. That structure improves Nvidia's performance by allowing information and strategy to flow more directly between Huang and Nvidia's other leaders, according to Huang.\n\n\"The more direct reports a CEO has, the less layers are in the company. It allows us to keep information fluid,\" he said.\n\nIt's all about putting his employees in the best position to succeed and contribute to Nvidia's overall success, Huang said at Stanford. It is the job of any good CEO to \"lead other people to achieve greatness, inspire, empower other people, support other people,\" he added. \"Those are the reasons why the management team exists: in service of all of the other people that work in the company.\"\n\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

Majid Asgaripour | Via Reuters\n\nIran elected Masoud Pezeshkian to its presidency, in an unexpected victory for the country's reformist camp amid deep social discontent, economic hardship, and regional war. Pezeshkian won 16.3 million votes, according to reports which cited the local authorities, with the election seeing a 49.8% turnout. His rival Saeed Jalili, a hard-line right-wing former nuclear negotiator, finished the race with 13.5 million votes. The 69-year-old Pezeshkian managed to defeat several other candidates, all of whom were stanchly conservative, even as many analysts described him as the \"token reformist\" and a \"second-tier candidate\" in the contender pool with little name recognition. The most moderate of the candidates, he formerly served as minister of health under Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, from 1997 to 2005, and Khatami among other reformist politicians endorsed him. Pezeshkian has also been a member of parliament since 2008, and is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of parliament. He wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially restarting nuclear talks with world powers.\n\nVehicles move past a billboard displaying the faces of the six presidential candidates (L-R) Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi Alireza Zakani, Saeed Jalili, Mostafa Pourmohammadi and Masoud Pezeshkianin in the Iranian capital Tehran on June 29, 2024. Iran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili are set to go to runoffs after securing the highest number of votes in Iran's presidential election, the interior ministry said. Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFundamental changes unlikely?\n\nThe new Iranian president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards. \"While the election could lead to shifts in the priorities, tone and tactics of Iran's domestic and foreign policies, a fundamental change in the status quo is unlikely,\" Sina Toossi, a senior non-resident fellow at the Center for International Policy, told CNBC. \"The core principles guiding Iran's strategic decisions, particularly concerning the U.S. and Israel, are firmly rooted in the broader framework set by the Supreme Leader and influential bodies like the Revolutionary Guard,\" he said.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Vanessa Acosta marries Sam Roberts in their backyard in Pasadena, California, on May 25, 2024. Courtesy: Vanessa Acosta\n\nLast year, Vanessa Acosta and Sam Roberts found their dream venue for a black-tie wedding. But a series of family events made the couple reconsider their plans: \"We don't need to do this big thing where we're going to put ourselves out financially,\" said Acosta, 35, of Pasadena, California. Instead of hosting around 150 guests and spending about $75,000, the couple decided to get married in their backyard with just 54 of their closest family and friends. More from Personal Finance:\n\nCouples leverage \u2018something borrowed\u2019 to cut wedding costs\n\nNearly 1 in 5 student loan borrowers keep their balance a secret from partner\n\nWhy couples avoid talking about financial issues Such events with roughly 50 guests, max, are called \"micro weddings.\" A so-called minimony is even smaller, usually attended by no more than 10 people, according to The Knot, an online wedding marketplace. Acosta and Roberts had a new budget of $3,000, and they knew they needed to get creative. \"We DIY'ed and thrifted everything,\" Acosta said. \"We thrifted my husband's shirt, he used his really nice dress shoes he already owned. I made my dress and I thrifted the fabrics; I made my veil.\" Cutting the guest list made the wedding \"much more manageable,\" she said. The couple tied the knot on May 25.\n\nWhy micro weddings are becoming appealing\n\nVanessa Acosta and Sam Roberts pose together on a street in California. Courtesy: Vanessa Acosta\n\nThe average cost of a wedding ceremony and reception in 2023 was $35,000, according to The Knot 2023 Real Weddings Study. The total cost is a $5,000 increase from 2022. Inflation over the past few years was a key driver to higher costs, according to the Knot. The report polled 9,318 US married couples between January 1 and December 2023. \"Put simply, weddings are expensive,\" said Allison Cullman, wedding expert and the vice president of brand marketing and strategy at Zola, another online wedding marketplace.\n\n'The number one way' to save on wedding costs\n\nAs the cost of typical weddings in the U.S. has swelled in the past few years, experts say cutting down the guest list is the best way to save on costs, even if you don't trim it to micro-wedding levels. In 2023, weddings with 25 to 50 guests took up about 15% of the market; weddings with less than 25 guests made up roughly 2% of the market, according to data from The Wedding Report, a wedding research company, provided to CNBC. The average guest count at weddings has been declining since 2006, when the average was about 184 people, according to data from The Wedding Report.\n\nWe don't need to do this big thing where we're going to put ourselves out financially. Vanessa Acosta\n\nThe lowest count was in 2020, when the average headcount declined to 107, primarily due to restrictions from the Covid-19 pandemic, said Shane McMurray, CEO and co-founder of The Wedding Report. The size of weddings rebounded in 2021 to 124 because people wanted to socialize after the lockdowns, he said. \"But because of how expensive it is to get married now,\" he said, the size of weddings is \"probably going to start to come back down.\" \"The number one way to save money on your wedding is to cut the guest count,\" said McMurray, as many wedding costs, like meals, invitations and favors, are based on your headcount. Indeed, \"having a minimony or a micro wedding allows you to still have an incredibly special celebration without having to pay for 150 meals,\" said Cullman.\n\nA sign that reads, \"Welcome to the wedding of Vanessa and Sam.\" Courtesy: Vanessa acosta\n\n\"It literally was not stressful to deal with the food situation for like a 50-ish person wedding,\" said Acosta, who booked a taco stand for $640 instead of roughly paying $90 per plate for about 150 guests. \"Ninety times 150 people. It was a drastic change to go from that to a taco stand that was able to feed every single one and there was still food left over,\" said Acosta.\n\nSet a 'clear and realistic' budget\n\nEngaged couples should come up with a \"clear and realistic\" budget from the beginning, as well as make a list of what their priorities are, said Cullman. Doing so will help you when you have to make \"difficult decisions to stay within your budget,\" she said. \"Couples should discuss what is the most important to them, and what they want to allocate towards items that will make their wedding feel unique, authentic, and most of all, fun,\" said Cullman. Confirming such priorities will help you \"determine where to focus your budget and where you can save,\" said Lauren Kay, executive editor of The Knot. You might need to make trade-offs along the way.",

        "body": "In April 2021, Paul Lee took a vacation to Thailand. Five months later, he decided to leave the United States behind and make a permanent move to the Asian country. Lee, originally from Georgia, had been living in New York City and grossing around $1 million a year thanks to his e-commerce business. Despite doing well enough to pay for his parent's retirement, the 28-year-old tells CNBC Make It he found himself without purpose, feeling depressed, and needing to make a change. \"When I first arrived to Thailand, I just felt rejuvenated. Everything was completely new to me, and I felt like it was a fresh new start,\" Lee says. \"The more and more I live here, the more and more I fall in love with the city.\"\n\nLee moved to Bangkok, Thailand in 2021. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make It\n\nSince moving to Bangkok, Lee has been making around US $150,000 a year as a content creator and real estate agent, according to documents reviewed. Working in real estate helped Lee find several living arrangements in Bangkok, including luxury condos. The apartment he's in now is a one-bedroom in the Thonglor neighborhood which Lee says is \"the Soho of Bangkok.\" It's a 650-square-feet unit that costs 20,000 baht \u2014 around USD $544 \u2014 in monthly rent. Lee also pays $20 for Wi-Fi, $80 for electricity, and $3 for water each month. The apartment came furnished, and Lee has access to amenities, including a pool and a gym.\n\nLee pays around $544 a month for his 1-bedroom apartment in Bangkok. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make It\n\nTo move in, Lee had to pay a security deposit of two months' rent or about $1,088. Despite lower grocery costs in Bangkok, Lee eats out for every meal and spends $500 a month on food. \"I'm not gonna lie, the food in New York City was very good as well, but I think in Thailand, it's just a lot more homey, a lot more local, and a lot spicier,\" Lee says. His other expenses include a $93 monthly gym membership which is a bit of a splurge considering Lee has free access to a gym in his building. But the cost is worth it for Lee, because he can take advantage of the co-working space, coffee, and numerous networking opportunities in the space. Also his current gym's price is nothing compared to luxury gyms in New York, like Equinox, where memberships can start at $240 a month.\n\nLee tells CNBC Make It he chose to leave America because he found himself materialistic and living in an \"environment that was just very individualistic, very doggish, and very hyper-aggressive.\" Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make It\n\nLee has only returned to the U.S. one time since his big move to Thailand \u2014 for his sister's wedding. He tells CNBC Make It he chose to leave New York City because he found himself being too materialistic and living in an \"environment that was just very individualistic, very doggish, and very hyper-aggressive.\" \"Bangkok stood out to me because it seemed very metropolis. It seemed very fun. It seemed very affordable and it just had a very good culture and didn't really have any major compromises to me,\" Lee says. Lee has made a new life for himself in Thailand, he says, and returning to the U.S. doesn't feel likely. \"I had to go through this journey of being poor and becoming quite wealthy to realize all this wealth that I had accumulated didn't really give me what I wanted and didn't give me the satisfaction I was looking for,\" Lee says.\n\nSince relocating to Thailand, Lee's parents have moved to South Korea and visit him several times throughout the year.

        "body": "Gomez, who was a computer science student at the University of Toronto at the time of his internship, left Google in 2021 to co-found Cohere, an AI startup that's backed by Nvidia and has reportedly raised money at a $5 billion valuation. Cohere makes generative AI models that can be used by companies, in contrast to consumer-facing products like OpenAI 's ChatGPT.\n\n\"There's no one in the field who was around back then working who could have foreseen where we are in terms of technological capability,\" Gomez told CNBC in a recent interview. \"The models are doing stuff that I personally thought maybe I'd see at the end of my career, maybe in like 40 years.\"\n\nAidan Gomez was an intern at Google Brain in 2017, when he helped co-author the \" Attention Is All You Need \" paper that conceptualized the transformer and eventually kicked off the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"We're having research come out of MIT and Harvard showing the productivity gains,\" Gomez said. \"You can just quantitatively measure it. You sit a knowledge worker down next to one of these models. You train them on how to use it, how to make it useful for them. They have to learn how to use the technology, but once they do, you see productivity lifts that are like 40%.\"\n\nIn June 2023, Cohere raised $270 million at a $2.2 billion valuation, from investors including Salesforce and Oracle. Cohere executives have even attended AI forums at the White House.\n\nGomez said that until recently, \"Everything to date has been done with like five people.\" Cohere now has about 400 people and is rapidly growing its sales team.\n\nWhen asked about specific use cases where generative AI can benefit a company's bottom line, Gomez cited a model Cohere built to help an insurer. The technology allows the company to submit faster quotes to beat out the competition when there's a request for proposal from a mining or pipeline firm.\n\nGomez called it a race.\n\n\"The first insurance provider that puts a reasonable bid in front of them wins that contract,\" he said. \"We augmented their actuaries, the folks who are doing the research on the project, assessing the risk, coming up with a quote.\"\n\nBy speeding up the actuaries, Gomez said the business was able to win more contracts.\n\n\"I never thought that an insurance company for natural resource projects would be adopting large language models,\" he said. \"But they are.\"\n\nWatch the video to hear the full conversation between CNBC's Steve Kovach and Aidan Gomez.",

        "body": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThomas Trutschel | Photothek | Getty Images\n\nThe trustee for Mt. Gox, the Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago, on Friday said the company has begun to make payments in bitcoin and in bitcoin cash to some of its creditors. The announcement added that repayments to other users of the hacked exchange would be \"promptly made\" if they meet certain conditions, including undergoing account verification, as well as subscribing to one of the designated digital asset exchanges through which the bankruptcy estate is facilitating disbursements in digital tokens. \"We ask eligible rehabilitation creditors to wait for a while,\" continues the statement. The price of bitcoin has plunged nearly 6% in the past 24 hours. Customers of the Tokyo-based exchange have been waiting 10 years to get their money back.\n\nWhat is Mt. Gox?\n\nOnce the world's largest crypto trading venues, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after a series of heists that saw up to 950,000 bitcoin \u2014 worth upward of $58 billion at today's prices \u2014 vanish. Mt. Gox blamed the bitcoin disappearance on a bug in the cryptocurrency's framework. While users were receiving incomplete transaction messages when accessing the exchange, coins may have actually been illicitly moved by hackers out of their accounts, Mt. Gox said. After declaring bankruptcy, 140,000 of the missing bitcoin were recovered, which means roughly $9 billion worth of bitcoin will be returned to owners, in today's prices. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $600 at the time of the bankruptcy. Today, it is worth more than $54,000 \u2014 an almost 9,000% increase. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, on Thursday and Friday, Mt. Gox moved billions of dollars in bitcoin from its crypto wallets ahead of the repayment memo. More than 47,000 bitcoins worth $2.7 billion were moved out of an offline cryptocurrency wallet associated with Mt. Gox, Arkham Intelligence said Friday. A portion of the funds, worth $84.9 million, was sent to Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, which is listed among the platforms supporting repayments to Mt. Gox users, according to Arkham Intelligence. A further $63.6 million of bitcoin was sent to an unknown counterparty, which Arkham Intelligence said was \"likely a listed repayments exchange.\" Mt. Gox wallets continue to hold 138,985 bitcoins, worth around $7.5 billion at current prices, according to Arkham Intelligence, meaning billions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency are yet to be paid out.\n\nHow will this affect bitcoin?",

        "title": "Here are 3 major reports that could drive the stock market in the week ahead",
        "body": "Wall Street finished higher for the holiday-shortened trading week, with tech stocks leading the way. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained under 1% for the week. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq , which both closed at record highs Friday \u2014 rising nearly 2% and 3.5%, respectively, for the week. The first week of July continued the strength seen in June, the second quarter, and the first half of 2024. The S & P 500 technology sector was the big winner this past week, with Apple and Broadcom as our top Club stocks. Consumer discretionary and communication services, featuring Club name Meta Platforms and Alphabet , were also strong. Energy led to the downside this week, followed by health care and industrials. Looking back on the week, short as it was given the early close on Wednesday and Thursday off, we got some notable updates on the economy and heard from Club holding Constellation Brands . The Corona and Modelo brewer's quarterly results Wednesday were decent , and the stock initially popped on the news. We told members that we were taking some profits in Constellation shortly before the open . However, the troubled wine and spirits business remained a problem that management must address in the coming quarters. Shares finished Wednesday down more than 3%, though they recovered much of that on Friday for a relatively flat week. Helping Friday's largely higher session was drop in bond yields \u2013 precipitated by an uptick in June's unemployment rate to 4.1% and only modestly higher than expected nonfarm payrolls additions of 206,000. Wage inflation was right in line with expectations. Taken as a whole, the government's monthly jobs report card supported the case of the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its September meeting. While market odds favor a second cut in December, the Fed projected after its June meeting just one rate cut this year. This past week also brought updates on the manufacturing sector. On Monday, June's ISM Manufacturing purchasing managers index came in weaker than expected and pointed to a faster-than-expected contraction, and on Wednesday, May's factory order numbers showed a monthly decline versus expectations for a small increase. The ISM's services PMI for June, out Wednesday, also disappointed, as it showed a contraction in the services sectors. Economists had been expecting to see an expansion. These readings were also green lights for the Fed to start cutting rates. We hope everyone had a good July 4 th and has a restful weekend. You'll want to take advantage of the lull because believe it or not, earnings season is back. Three of the four big money center banks report this coming Friday, including Club name Wells Fargo . The government also delivers key data on consumer and wholesale inflation. Economic data : The June consumer price index (CPI) is out on Thursday morning, and the June producer price index (PPI) is out on Friday morning. Of the two, CPI carries more weight given that it more closely represents what consumers are paying for a basket of goods from one year, or month, to the next, which is the Fed's main concern. However, PPI is important to track because it tells us what is happening at the cost input level for corporations. That speaks to margin dynamics \u2013 and therefore, it can inform us on both profitability and potential price actions companies may need to take in the future to protect profitability. Within the CPI data, be sure to watch the shelter component, which has been a huge thorn in the Fed's side. Shelter, a barometer of what people pay for housing, has proven a very sticky source of inflation \u2013 a problem because, for most Americans, it represents a large and unavoidable cost. For headline CPI, economists are looking for a 3.1% annual increase, according to FactSet as of Friday. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to increase 3.5% year over year. If realized, that would represent a slight deceleration at the headline level but a slight acceleration at the core level. As for PPI, economists are looking for a 2.3% annual increase at the headline level and a 2.5% year-over-year rise at the core level. Those numbers would be slightly higher than what we saw in May. Earnings season : Within the portfolio, net interest income (NII) guidance is going to be a key watch item when Wells Fargo reports its quarter this coming Friday. At an industry conference Tuesday, CFO Michael Santomassimo reiterated guidance for NII to be down 7% to 9% year over year. We still think this outlook could be conservative since the Fed's higher-for-longer policy is generally a tailwind to net interest income. However, other factors like muted loan demand have prevented Wells Fargo from raising its outlook this year. Recognizing strong recent runs in shares of Wells Fargo and our other Club bank Morgan Stanley , we took some profits this past Friday. Morgan Stanley is set to deliver its earnings on Tuesday, July 16. We're also interested to hear management's thoughts on the intended pace of share repurchases in the second half of the year, now that the results of the stress test are in. Wells Fargo \u2013 and our other bank name Morgan Stanely \u2013 both passed, indicating they have strong capital positions with excess money to return to shareholders. Other higher-level watch items in the Wells Fargo report include commentary on the state of consumer savings, an indication of further buying power, and the real estate market, which has been something we've been monitoring as the world finds a new normal post-Covid.

        "title": "The unique exercise this neuroscientist does for optimal brain health: 'Physical activity is so powerful for our brain'",
        "body": "To keep your brain health in good shape, you should engage in physical activity as often as you can.\n\n\"Physical activity is so powerful for our brain,\" Dr. Wendy Suzuki, neuroscientist and dean of NYU College of Arts and Science, said in an episode of a recent MasterClass series that features neuroscientists and psychiatrists sharing advice for optimal brain health.\n\nSuzuki mentioned how walking 10 minutes a day can do wonders for your mood and that strategic sports like soccer and basketball engage your prefrontal cortex more than other exercises.

It was created by Patricia Moreno in 2002.\n\n\"This workout pairs high-energy cardio moves with high-emotion mantras that will leave you uplifted, connected, and strong,\" according to the official website for intenSati.\n\nSpeaking positive affirmations out loud can strongly impact your outlook on life and your overall mood, Suzuki said.\n\n\"If you shout out that you believe you will succeed, you are inspired, you are strong, for a whole hour with a whole bunch of other sweaty, affirmations-shouting people, you come out of that class feeling amazing.\"\n\nA recent study done at the University of California Berkeley encouraged 135 undergraduate students to say compassionate things to themselves for 20 seconds a day, coupled with compassionate touch like placing a hand on their heart. After one month of consistently doing this practice, students reported feeling less stress and seeing improvements in their mental health.\n\n\"But whatever the form of workout that you do, any time of day you can work out is the best time of day to workout because our lives are so busy,\" Suzuki said.\n\nA 2022 study that examined the health information of more than 500,000 people found that those who regularly engaged in vigorous physical activity like exercise and sports decreased their risk of developing dementia by 35%.\n\nBut even doing household chores regularly lowered an individual's risk by 21%.\n\n\"Every single drop of sweat counts for your brain,\" she said, \"And that's good news.\"\n\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

        "body": "watch now\n\nThe U.S. economy again added slightly more jobs than expected in June though the unemployment rate increased, the Labor Department reported Friday. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 206,000 for the month, better than the 200,000 Dow Jones forecast though less than the downwardly revised gain of 218,000 in May, which was cut sharply from the initial estimate of 272,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed to 4.1%, tied for the highest level since October 2021 and providing a conflicting sign for Federal Reserve officials weighing their next move on monetary policy. The forecast had been for the jobless rate to hold steady at 4%. \"It's a soft landing kind of report,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"This does support the idea that [the Fed] will cut relatively soon, and we continue to think September is the most likely.\" The increase in the unemployment rate came as the labor force participation rate, which indicates the level of working-age people who are employed or actively searching for a job, rose to 62.6%, up 0.1 percentage point. The so-called prime age rate, which focuses on those between ages 25 and 54, rose to 83.7%, its highest in more than 22 years. A broader unemployment rate which counts discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons held steady at 7.4%. Household employment, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, rose by 116,000. The household survey also showed a decrease of 28,000, in full-time workers and an increase of 50,000 in part-time workers.\n\nThough June job creation topped expectations, it was due in large part to a 70,000 surge in government jobs. Also, health care, a consistent leader by sector, added 49,000 while social assistance contributed 34,000 and construction was up 27,000. Several sectors saw declines, including professional and business services (-17.000) and retail (-9,000). On wages, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 3.9% from a year ago, both in line with estimates. The average work week was steady at 34.3 hours. Stock market futures nudged higher following the report while Treasury yields were negative. Traders also increased their bets that the Fed would implement its initial interest rate cut in September.",

        "body": "In this article GFS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nThe semiconductor industry is recruiting workers in a tight labor market as the competition for talent ramps up and funding from the CHIPS and Science Act designed to spur domestic production continues to be dispersed. It is also staring down a projected shortfall of as much as one million workers in the broader U.S. economy by 2030 as generative artificial intelligence adds fuel to the in-demand sector. The U.S. chips industry is expected face a shortage of 67,000 technicians, computer scientists and engineers by 2030, while the broader U.S. economy is set to have a gap of 1.4 million such workers, according to a 2023 study from the Semiconductor Industry Association. A separate study from Deloitte found the talent crunch in the semiconductor space could get even worse due to the global economic environment and ongoing supply chain issues.\n\nA wafer sorter inside the GlobalFoundries semiconductor manufacturing facility in Malta, New York, on June 18, 2024. Cindy Schultz | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nGlobalFoundries , the third-largest chipmaker globally, is casting a wide net to recruit talent. The company has sought out veteran candidates, along with candidates from its own workforce reentry program and an initiative for women in construction. The company creates chips for everyday products from electronics and phones to autos, in addition to components for space and defense. Major clients include General Motors and Lockheed Martin . In 2021, the company launched the sector's first registered apprenticeship program, which is full time and paid with benefits, with training at no cost to the apprentice. It is completed in two years or less, and requires only a high school diploma or equivalent and interest in the mechanical field. Some 50 apprentices have gone through the program so far, the company said. It has recruited graduates with technical associate degrees from regional community colleges and veterans transitioning out of the military for the program. GlobalFoundries is working to fill hundreds of roles at a time worldwide, and hires thousands annually, a pace it expects to continue, Chief People Officer Pradheepa Raman told CNBC in an interview. Raman said keeping the same size workforce is \"not an option\" for the industry as demand soars. The needs range from technicians to product managers and corporate roles. \"It's why we are very, very aggressive when it comes to our workforce development efforts,\" Raman said. \"And if you're not getting traditional talent, [the solution is] cross-training talent, identifying alternate talent pools, people who are doing things in different fields, showing them that this is a very welcoming set of opportunities that exists within the semiconductor industry, is our approach.\"\n\nThe GlobalFoundries semiconductor manufacturing facility in Malta, New York, on June 18, 2024. Cindy Schultz | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nWorkers also have room for advancement, and training and retaining existing workers is key in this competitive environment. Morgan Woods, 28, started out in Malta, New York, at GlobalFoundries' fab facility as a technician in 2021. Woods has now moved into a training and development analyst role with the company, overseeing training for technicians, engineers and management, plus ensuring compliance. Woods said compliance is crucial as the company expands into the automotive space, working with GM. \"As the demand for the microchips increases, we definitely need more manpower to help support the constant rollout of microchips and meeting our daily targets,\" Woods said. Woods has taken advantage of a benefit from GlobalFoundries launched in May, allowing eligible U.S.-based employees and new hires to receive a tax-free lifetime total of $28,500 toward student debt. It includes qualified loans for all degree types and credit-based certificate programs offered by U.S. universities and colleges. So far, the number of applicants has topped 200, exceeding expectations, the company said. \"By participating in this program, I will be in a much better financial position to purchase a home within the next few years, as well as look at expanding my family and having children,\" Woods said. Beyond helping to create roles in engineering and computer science, funding from the CHIPS and Science Act will also bolster growth for GlobalFoundries' manufacturing fabs in New York and Vermont. In February, the company announced $1.5 billion in planned CHIPS funding to expand manufacturing capacity. It projects that funding, along with local and state money, will help create some 1,500 manufacturing jobs and 9,000 construction jobs over the lifetime of planned projects. Manufacturing and construction have faced worker shortages of their own recently, and aim to lure new and younger hires to the field. \"We believe the challenges that we face in recruiting can be solved through an ecosystem approach of workforce development and making our organization one of the best places to work through the benefits offerings that we have been providing,\" Raman said.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Amy Dickinson, 64, has shared life advice in her widely syndicated news column, \"Ask Amy,\" for two decades. Over the years, she wrote many times about emotional intelligence \u2014 how to be more self-aware, manage your own feelings, and better show up for other people. In her final column, she concentrates her best advice into a few key phrases. \"I sometimes supply 'scripts' for people who have asked me for the right words to say,\" she wrote, \"and so I thought I would boil these down to some of the most important statements I believe anyone can make.\" Those seven phrases, according to Dickinson, are: I need help I'm sorry I forgive you I love you, just as you are I'm on your side You're safe You are not alone\n\nWhy it's so hard to say 'I need help'\n\nDickinson's first statement is arguably the most difficult for people to incorporate into their lives, experts say, because having to ask for help can make you feel vulnerable, unintelligent or like you're not in control. \"Many of us overestimate the likelihood that the people we're asking for help will say 'no.' For those who associate rejection with an attack on their self-worth, that's a big obstacle,\" Dutch psychoanalyst Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries wrote for the Harvard Business Review. \"Consequently, they would rather carry the burden of their problems alone.\" Asking for assistance actually shows self-awareness and can make the person you're approaching feel good, according to de Vries. \"When you place trust in others, you show that you value them, which deepens the relationship,\" he wrote. \"In turn, they'll trust you enough to ask for help when they're in need themselves.\"\n\n'Emotionally intelligent people understand' the power of empathy and gratitude\n\nShowing empathy, patience and gratitude for others by using phrases that build connection, like \"I'm on your side\" and \"you are not alone,\" is a surefire sign of emotional intelligence, says Juliette Han, a Harvard-trained neuroscientist and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. These characteristics can take you far both in the workplace and beyond it. \"Gratitude shouldn't be conditional, and emotionally intelligent people understand this well,\" Han recently told CNBC Make It. Telling colleagues you appreciate their efforts is a sign of high EQ, he adds. Emotionally intelligent people \"recognize and congratulate someone on a job well done, even if the work was behind the scenes, or they didn't personally gain from it, because they are compassionate and empathetic.\"\n\nA more fulfilled life with fewer regrets",

Identity theft victims have waited more than 22 months for resolution, plus several weeks for refunds.\n\nTax identity theft happens when criminals use stolen personal information to file a fraudulent tax return to claim a refund.

Courtesy: Magnolia Pictures\n\nScammers exploit 'fear and urgency'\n\nScams like the one Thelma fell victim to are increasingly common, experts say. Imposter fraud was the most common type of fraud reported to the FTC in 2023, and the agency saw an increase in reports of business and government impersonators. Social media is fertile ground for harvesting content for these scams. With advancements in generative AI, a scammer can run just a few seconds of audio from a TikTok video to make the harvested voice say whatever they want, according to computer security company McAfee. \"Everybody should know that deep fakes are becoming more and more popular and common and easier to do, and there are whole industries built around scamming people,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and physician who founded Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. Typically, AI voice scams mimic distress calls. It could be someone stuck on the side of the road after their car broke down or someone calling from jail in a foreign country claiming they need bail money. The common denominator is that it's coming from someone you care about who needs money \"fast.\" A 2023 survey from McAfee found that 25% of adults have experienced a similar AI voice scam \u2014 and the company says 77% of victims have lost money as a result. The company polled 7,054 adults in seven countries, including 1,009 in the United States. Thelma's age in the movie was a factor in her vulnerability. \"They target the elderly, because as we get older, we lose cognitive flexibility, meaning that we can't make decisions as quickly, and so it takes us longer to think through things,\" said McClanahan, who is a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. \"And so these scamsters use techniques like fear and urgency to try to get you to act immediately.\"\n\nBut older adults aren't the only ones at risk; younger people who spend more time online are increasingly vulnerable, CFP Andrew Sivertsen said. \"You think about Gen Z and young millennials, I mean, just the number of impressions that they have online with technology is just exponentially more than seniors and so they're falling victim to a higher number of scams,\" said Sivertsen, a senior planner at The Planning Center in Moline, Illinois.\n\nProtecting loved ones and yourself from scams\n\nSpeaking with an older loved one about the risk of being scammed can be difficult, and much of the movie showed Thelma grappling with her own autonomy in the situation. After falling for the scam, she had to come to terms with the fact that she needed help with technology and taking care of herself, but she wasn't ready to give up her freedom. \"You have to find a way to kind of process the feelings of watching somebody go through something like this, but also to do so in a thoughtful way, so that when you do talk to them about it, you don't kind of add to the shame and embarrassment that I believe is probably already there,\" Margolin said.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Patchareeporn Sakoolchai | Moment | Getty Images\n\nSummer is the season of road trips. A record 70.9 million Americans are expected to travel by car during the July Fourth holiday week alone, according to AAA. For some car owners, it might be more financially savvy to rent a vehicle for a road trip than use their own, experts said. \"It's going to be pretty dependent on a variety of factors,\" said Greg Brannon, AAA's director of automotive engineering research. Those factors include your current vehicle's gas mileage, the distance you'll be driving, how long you'll be gone, whether you lease or own and how big your vehicle is, among other things, according to Toyota. Here are some key considerations.\n\nThe car's specs\n\nVehicle capacity is a \"no-brainer\" when it comes to choosing whether to rent or not, said Brian Moody, executive editor of Autotrader, a car shopping site. It's easiest to say, \"I have a five-passenger car and I have eight going on the trip,\" Moody said. Drivers may also need to compare specifications, such as the necessity of a two-wheel-drive versus a four-wheel-drive car, as well as storage space for luggage and gear.\n\nOperating costs\n\nThis is where the math gets a bit trickier. There are many financial costs, some obvious and others less so. Drivers would need to compare total rental costs \u2014 the daily rental rate and potential add-ons like insurance \u2014 versus those of operating their own car. \"Most people will be shocked at what it actually costs to own and operate their car,\" Brannon said.\n\nwatch now\n\nFueling costs, such as gasoline or electric charging, are a financial consideration for both renters and car owners. It may be possible to rent a more fuel-efficient vehicle and save money. For instance, renting a car that gets 40 miles per gallon versus a currently owned one that gets 20 mpg would, all else equal, cut fuel costs in half. \"If you have an old car that's fuel inefficient, it might make sense to rent something,\" Moody said.\n\nRental costs\n\nThe average rental cost $42 a day in the second quarter of 2024, with most travelers looking for four-day rentals, according to travel site Hopper. The daily rate can be higher or lower based on factors like rental company, car type, and pickup and drop-off location. The cost of rental car insurance might add $30 to $61 to the daily rate, depending on insurance type, according to Allianz Travel, citing MarketWatch data. More from Personal Finance:\n\nIs inflation Biden's or Trump's fault?\n\nRomance scams cost consumers $1.14 billion in 2023\n\nFAFSA issues force hard choices for students Renters who want car insurance may not need to buy additional coverage through the rental company. Car owners may already get full coverage on a rental via their own car insurance policies, or may have some coverage through credit-card benefits, Brannon said. \"Call your insurance agent and double-check your coverage,\" he said. \"You can save yourself a bunch of money by not double-insuring the vehicle if you don't need to.\"\n\nDepreciation and mileage caps on leases\n\nAlistair Berg | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nAdditionally, car owners who lease a vehicle should weigh factors like mileage caps before taking a long road trip. For example, the typical lease imposes financial penalties on drivers who put more than 12,000 miles a year on their vehicle, according to Kelley Blue Book. The cost for exceeding that cap is usually about 20 to 30 cents per mile, KBB said. (At 30 cents, a driver would pay $300 for every 1,000 miles over the mileage limit.) There are also depreciation costs to consider. Depreciation causes a car to lose value over time. Cars famously lose about 10% to 15% of their value once they drive it off the lot, Brannon said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDepreciation is \"the biggest expense of owning a vehicle,\" Brannon said. And that's why it matters for road trips, he says. \"The more miles you put on a vehicle the more it depreciates,\" Brannon said. Every mile puts wear and tear on the engine, tires and other moving parts, according to Allianz. Depreciation affects all cars differently. The average car depreciates at about 20 cents a mile, according to Toyota. For shorter road trips \u2014 say, 1,000 to 1,500 miles in a given year \u2014 depreciation might not be a big deal relative to rental prices, said Autotrader's Moody. Depreciation generally only matters for people who plan to sell or trade in their vehicle in the future.\n\nState of the vehicle\n\nUnforeseen repairs can be costly: The average repair order on the road is \"well in excess of $500,\" excluding towing costs, Brannon said, citing AAA data. The odds of a breakdown are lower with rental cars, which are generally newer models, Moody said. The average used car on the road is about 12 years old, he explained.",

Setting a landmark precedent, NATO last month agreed to allow Budapest's nonparticipation in the coalition's deepening support of Ukraine \u2014 in exchange for Hungary not blocking such initiatives.\n\nHungary will soon become the only country in Europe able to carry out dialogue with both Russia and Ukraine, Orban told Putin during the Friday visit, according to comments reported by Reuters and Russian state news agency Tass.\n\nThe trip to Moscow is the second stop on Orban's self-described \"peace mission,\" after the Hungarian leader carried out his first wartime visit to Ukraine on Tuesday to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAfter the engagement, Zelenskyy said that the pair had held talks over \"the most fundamental issues of our neighborly relations \u2013 trade, cross-border cooperation, infrastructure, and energy,\" and noted that the dialogue could set the foundation for \"a new bilateral document\" between the two nations.\n\nOrban also stressed Budapest's intentions to improve ties with Ukraine, while calling on Zelenskyy to consider a cease-fire in the hostilities with Russia in a bid to accelerate peace talks, Reuters reported.\n\n\"You cannot make peace from a comfortable armchair in Brussels,\" Orban said Friday in a social media post. \"Even if the rotating EU-Presidency has no mandate to negotiate on behalf of the EU, we cannot sit back and wait for the war to miraculously end. We will serve as an important tool in making the first steps towards #peace. This is what our peace mission is about.\"\n\nSeveral peace initiatives have been floated \u2014 including Zelenskyy's 10-point plan, a Chinese proposal and Putin's own conditions to entertain negotiations \u2014 without gaining traction.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Kyiv was not advised of Orban's trip to Moscow, which was made \"without agreement or coordination with Ukraine,\" according to a Google-translated statement.\n\n\"We remind you that for our country the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all countries to strictly adhere to it,\" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said, adding that the \"only realistic way to restore a just peace\" remains Zelenskyy's peace formula.\n\nOrban's trip to Moscow has also drawn the wrath of European officials, who questioned his authority to represent the bloc.",

Shares in the Danish pharmaceutical company's shares were little changed on Thursday, dipping in early morning trade before rising 0.1% as of 11:17 a.m. London time.\n\nThe Harvard report found that patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity, who are prescribed semaglutide, have an increased risk of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) \u2014 a condition which can lead to loss of vision in one eye.

Cameron Smith | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Britain elected its first Labour prime minister in 14 years, with a landslide victory for the opposition party during the July 4 elections. Keir Starmer takes the country's top job from Rishi Sunak with projections suggesting his left-of-center party could have a majority of around 170 seats. Starmer has had a rapid political ascent after entering the U.K. Parliament less than a decade ago. But many Britons still know little about the man who has positioned himself as the country's change candidate. CNBC takes a look at the U.K.'s new prime minister and his platform.\n\nHuman rights lawyer-turned-politician\n\nStarmer was born in 1962 in London to a father who worked as a toolmaker and a mother who was a nurse. The 61-year-old has often referenced his modest beginnings as a point of connection with British voters and says his mother's lifelong battle with a severe illness gave him a deep gratitude for the National Health Service (NHS). Starmer was the first in his family to go to university, studying law at the University of Leeds. After postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford, Starmer began working as a barrister \u2014 or British trial attorney \u2014 in 1987, taking on high-profile cases, including against Shell, McDonald's and former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's mine closures.\n\nwatch now\n\nStarmer also served as a human rights advisor during former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's landmark Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement. In 2008, a year after marrying his wife, Victoria, Starmer became director of public prosecutions, putting him at the head of the U.K.'s Crown Prosecution Service. Starmer was knighted in 2014 for his services to criminal justice and was elected to Parliament the following year, serving as immigration minister and Brexit minister for the opposition. In 2020, he was appointed Labour leader and instigated a major overhaul of the party after the resignation of Jeremy Corbyn, who led the faction to a record loss in the 2019 election.\n\nIn his 2024 election campaign, Starmer touted a \"decade of national renewal\" for the country following what Labour has described as years of spending cuts and falling living standards under the Tories. In the party's election manifesto, published last month, Starmer outlined spending measures to create a new publicly owned energy company, reduce NHS waiting times, build new homes and renationalize rail services.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer gives a speech as he visits the Vale Inn on June 27, 2024 in Macclesfield, United Kingdom. Cameron Smith | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBut he also positioned himself as staunchly pro-business, continuing his yearslong charm offensive on traditionally right-leaning voters with plans for \"wealth creation\" and a National Wealth Fund. \"Economic growth and social justice must go hand in hand,\" Starmer said at the launch event of the manifesto. Labour has outlined five long-term missions if it comes to power: drive economic growth, invest in green energy, overhaul the NHS, create safer streets and deliver \"opportunity\" through a new skills agenda. To aid these goals, Starmer is planning a radical shake-up of government ministries, Labour officials told the Financial Times. Starmer, who voted for the Remain campaign not to depart the European Union in the U.K.'s 2016 EU referendum, has also pledged to improve the \"botched\" U.K.-EU deal, including in areas such as trade, research and security. However, he has insisted there is no case for Britain to rejoin the bloc.\n\nPublic image problem?\n\nDespite his change agenda, Starmer is seen by many as an establishment figure, lacking the charisma of other politicians. A YouGov poll from earlier this year ranked him behind Reform's Nigel Farage in terms of public popularity \u2014 and his rating fell further among younger voters.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "General view of Bishopsgate in the City of London, the capital's financial district. The UK economy has reportedly seen faster growth than initially estimated in early 2024. Vuk Valcic | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe U.K.'s Labour Party won big in Thursday's election and is now set to take over from the Conservatives after 14 years, at a time when economic uncertainty is still rife in the country. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index climbed 0.4% as investors reacted to the election results on Friday, while the British pound made only light gains. The FTSE 350 household goods and home construction index was up about 1%. Looking at individual stocks within the sector, Persimmon shares rose 2.9%, while Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Bellway were all up roughly 2%. Interest rates remain elevated in the U.K. as the central bank has battled high inflation following the Covid-19 slowdown. The two main political parties ran on different economic and financial manifestos during the election campaign that would likely have different consequences for the investing environment. The Labour party's pledge, for example, to increase taxes on the compensation that private equity fund managers received raised a few eyebrows, and led to questions on what this could mean more broadly. Speaking to CNBC, a selection of experts weighed in on the potential impact the change of government could have on U.K. investment.\n\nwatch now\n\nStock markets\n\nThe arrival of a new Labour government hasn't moved markets all that much yet but analysts expect U.K. assets to become more attractive from here on out. In a note Friday, analysts at Jefferies said, despite concerns raised by a strong showing for the right-wing Reform UK Party, the Labour Party's U.K. election win would help make the U.K. appear \"relatively stable.\" This, in combination with regulatory reform, \"could raise the attractiveness of UK assets,\" Jefferies' analysts wrote in a research note. James McManus, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, meanwhile told CNBC that the vast majority of the time, \"markets don't really care\" about elections. \"Historical data shows us that elections and their results rarely move markets when the expected outcome is delivered.\" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, broadly echoed McManus' comments in a note published this week, but added that there could be some impact on the economy. \"A widely predicted Labour win in the UK could usher in an era of greater stability for the UK \u2026 which should help bolster investor sentiment towards the UK,\" she said. In recent years the U.K.'s political landscape has been characterized by frequent leadership changes, which at times have led to market turmoil \u2014 especially during former PM Liz Truss' brief premiership.\n\nwatch now\n\nSome sectors \u2014 and therefore specific stocks \u2014 could also be affected, Streeter pointed out. Pressure could be added to the utilities sector as Labour plans to increase fines for water companies which are already being weighed down by high costs. Meanwhile, the party's pledge to boost the country's defense budget could see U.K. airspace stocks benefit from additional spending on new technology and equipment.\n\nProperty markets and housing\n\nPlans from all parties to build more houses could impact the property and housing sector, Richard Donnell, executive director for research at Zoopla, told CNBC. \"Investors would welcome this focus on home building,\" he said. \"What investors want is more focus on housing and delivering the homes the nation needs and leveraging in as much private investment as possible to create an attractive investment for more capital and to support the ambitions of the new Government.\" Some housebuilding stocks may also see a boost due to Labour's plans to build new, affordable homes, Hargreaves Lansdown noted.\n\nwatch now\n\nWider economic developments will however also be a factor, according to Nutmeg's McManus. As interest rates are set to fall, so will mortgage rates, which could lead to more people buying or selling homes, he said, adding that this could also have knock-on effects for other businesses like furniture and DIY shops. Aynsley Lammin, an equity analyst at Investec, said Labour's plan to restore mandatory housebuilding targets would be a \"quick win\" for the sector that should boost planning and supply. RBC's head of European capital goods research told CNBC's Silvia Amaro Friday agreed that the house building sector stands to be a major beneficiary of the Labour Party's landslide victory.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"It's front and center great for house builders, great for the wider building supply sector, bricks,\" Mark Fielding said, pointing to two driving factors. \"Two big factors: firstly a return to mandated targets for house building supporting 1.5 million new homes over the next five years, which would be a big positive, and secondly hopes on planning reforms, targeting to get that done.\" That will in turn allow for faster planning processes and potentially for additional central government intervention to press ahead with more house approvals, according to Fielding, who noted that investor focus will otherwise now narrow on the Labour Party's ability to deliver on broader economic growth. \"U.K. bank stocks in the end are one of the biggest proxies for U.K. economic growth,\" he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe British pound\n\nStrategists and economists predict the British pound will not be impacted strongly by the election. If results are as expected, attention will shift away from the U.K. election quickly, Shreyas Gopal, strategist, and Sanjay Raja, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note published Wednesday. \"For EUR/GBP, this then means turning attention to the election across the channel [in France], and then the forthcoming UK data in mid-July that will determine whether the BoE are able to pull the trigger on a first rate cut in early August,\" they said.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn the longer-term, there are also not \"huge risks\" for the pound under a Labour government, Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, told CNBC. Potential renegotiations of Brexit deals would, if anything, be more pro-growth under Labour, and risks of excessive government spending are also low, he explained. But the pound could still be on course for a difficult time, Pesole suggested. \"We see the pound depreciating against the euro in the next 24 months primarily on the back of our view for larger Bank of England cuts compared to the ECB,\" he said. Higher taxes in the U.K. could also weaken its currency \u2014 but those would likely come regardless of the election outcome, according to Pesole.\n\nBond markets",

        "body": "watch now\n\nTwo winters ago, we vacationed to a hot-spot resort in the Caribbean with our family. Around the perimeter of its casino concourse, a variety of attractions buzzed for our consumption. We found an art installation to climb on, faux floral arches to position ourselves around and giant milkshakes topped with full desserts in sugar-rimmed glasses to sip from \u2014 well, not before the photos. Photos came first. To be honest, it felt less like a vacation and more like a visit to one of those immersive exhibits where everything's a photo-op and everyone you know has taken the same exact photos there. This is because they have taken the same exact photos there, and doubtless, geotagged their location.\n\nSocial media has transformed the reason we take photos on vacation. According to a survey conducted by Forbes Advisor, 82% of Gen Zers and 57% of millennials visit certain destinations because they saw them on social media. Many people post their travels in real time, engaging in a perpetual game of capture and share. According to the same survey, 74% of respondents feel some kind of pressure to imitate the travel content they consume online. Without question, we fell into that camp on our vacation. It was performative, exhausting, and above all, absurdly expensive. Don't get us wrong \u2014 we love social media for connecting with friends, drawing inspiration from others, and yes, even drooling a bit over beautiful destinations. But its hazard lies in clouding your better judgment when making financial decisions that might not be worth it in real life. This summer, a little more than half of Americans are planning to take a vacation, according to a Bankrate survey. Out of those travelers, 36% are prepared to take on debt to pay for it. Costs continue to rise across the board for flights, accommodations, even dining, and consumer buying is keeping pace. In the process, many travelers are losing sight of their long-term goals to capture something that feels important in a moment but isn't at all.\n\n'Pics or it didn't happen' comes at a cost\n\nMorsa Images | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nYou lose the plot \u2014 and your money \u2014 when what's supposed to be for you becomes about showcasing it for everyone else. It's a classic case of \"pics or it didn't happen.\" You can end up spending more time focused on the wrong elements of your vacation, like positioning yourself for the perfect sunset photo-op but then not watching the actual sunset, or filming half of a concert with the camera flipped around on you. We've all done this; it's no one person's fault. But is snapping those pics worth paying inflated prices? Going into credit card debt? Stretching your annual vacation budget to accommodate the resort everyone claims to love so much? Without core memories affixed to those photos, they are not nearly as valuable. The casino resort was crowded, the restaurants priced like Las Vegas, the waits long for almost anything. We had a lovely time together as a family, but almost nothing we snapped a photo of contributed to that time.\n\nDial into vacation elements that are important to you\n\nWhen you're trying to budget and plan for your summer vacation, come up with your cost ceiling first. See how much your proposed travel and accommodation costs eat into that number. If they almost reach your limit, maybe that version of the trip is too expensive. You want to leave room to experience the vacation, and those experiences will come at a cost. In terms of what you choose to do, put yourselves at the center of those decisions. What will cause you to depart for home from your vacation saying, that felt really good? Dial into the things that are important to you and your family \u2014 not what's trending online. If you're into food, focus on the food. If you're into adventure, invest in that. When you set your itinerary with intention, you find the perspective you need to scale back on the superfluous things that cause you to overspend.",

As the tech giant's first-ever Chief Innovation Evangelist, Pferdt sought to create a more cohesive structure for nurturing creativity across divisions. Pferdt created the company's Innovation Lab and co-founded the Google Garage, where he encouraged thousands of employees to collaborate and experiment on fresh ideas. Before deciding to leave Google in 2022, he learned several important lessons, including from co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, he tells CNBC Make It. The philosophies and daily routines he picked up during that time helped him and others \"build a culture of innovation\" at the company, Pferdt says. He describes them more in depth in his recent book, \"What's Next Is Now: How to Live Future Ready.\" But his top three lessons aren't just useful for tech workers: They can help anyone \"live a more meaningful life,\" he says.\n\n1. Embrace a 'Yes, and' mentality\n\nToo often, Pferdt says, people opt for a more negative outlook, \"finding arguments why something wouldn't work.\" \"Most of our time we spend time saying 'No, but,' right?\" he says. \"If you turn that around and have a little bit more of a 'Yes, and' mentality \u2014 and, that is inspired by improv theater, obviously \u2014 it really changes the dynamic of your conversations [and] of the teams you're working on.\" In his book, Pferdt writes about how that \"Yes, and\" philosophy, which depends on curiosity and a willingness to constantly experiment, was key to the development of technological advancements at Google, like the company's Street View technology. \"Larry Page had been thinking about whether it was possible to photographically map the whole planet ('yes, and \u2026') [so] he mounted the camera on his car to capture video as he tooled around the streets of San Francisco,\" Pferdt writes in his book, noting that Page's initial idea, and the Google-funded work of Stanford researchers, soon led to others getting involved and adding new features, like spatial recognition and data collection.\n\n2.

Deliveries fell 4.8% from a year earlier, but the decline wasn't as steep as the 8.5% year-over-year drop in the first quarter.\n\nWhile the deliveries report suggested demand for Tesla vehicles remains stronger than feared, it offered a limited view into company performance.\n\nWith its autos business mired in a sales decline due to an aging lineup, and stronger competition than ever, Tesla has for months been incentivizing EV purchases with discounts, low- or no-interest financing options and other perks.\n\nIn the second quarter, for example, Tesla slashed prices in Germany and Norway and offered zero-interest loan promos in China, even for its entry-level Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUVs. In the U.S., Tesla offered a three-year, 2% APR financing deal for buyers of its rear-wheel drive Model 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's newest model, the angular steel Cybertruck, has gotten off to a slow start, with quality problems necessitating four voluntary recalls in the U.S. in less than a year.",

Toby Melville | Reuters\n\nLONDON \u2014 The U.K.'s Labour Party won a huge parliamentary majority in the country's general election, but a quirk of the British electoral system means it did so with just 34% of the total votes cast. Results show that the opposition Labour Party has won 412 parliamentary seats of the total 650, with just two seats yet to be declared. This translates as roughly 63% of the total seats, but Labour has won just 34% of the total \"popular\" vote, while the Conservative Party has secured nearly 24% of that number. Meanwhile, smaller parties including the centrist Liberal Democrats, right-wing Reform U.K. and the Greens took nearly 43% of the popular vote but gained just less than 18% of the seats available.\n\nwatch now\n\nThis was aided by the U.K.'s \"first past the post\" system, where voters choose only one single candidate from their local list in each of the country's 650 constituencies. The person with the most votes in each constituency is elected as a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons, the U.K.'s lower house. The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons usually forms the new government and its leader becomes prime minister. Unlike in other voting systems, there are no second rounds or ranking of first- and second-choice candidates, meaning it can be difficult for smaller parties to translate an increased share of the popular vote into parliamentary seats. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, said in a note released Friday that this election \"marks a warning sign for the political system, [as] a large majority has been delivered on a little more than a third of the popular vote.\" She pointed out that voter turnout was just 60% for this election. That represents the second-lowest turnout rate since 1918, after 2001, when turnout fell to 59.4%. This 7.6% fall in turnout from 2019 indicated a \"broader political disconnect,\" said Dickens. \"The scale of Labour's majority is as much an outcome of the peculiarities of our voting system and an interplay of split votes and the [collapse of the] Scottish National Party (SNP), rather than of a resurgence in Labour's popularity,\" she said.\n\nwatch now",

        "title": "Can Israel's Iron Dome be overrun? System's capabilities in focus amid rising risk of war with Hezbollah",
        "body": "Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets launched from the Gaza Strip, as seen from Ashkelon, in southern Israel, October 20, 2023. Amir Cohen | Reuters\n\nOn Thursday morning, Hezbollah said it launched 200 rockets into Israel \u2014 one of its largest attacks yet \u2014 following the Israeli assassination of one of the group's senior commanders, further ramping up fears over a potential full-blown war between the two heavily armed adversaries. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K., said it fired at 10 Israeli military sites using a \"squadron of drones.\" Israel's military said that \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets\" breached its territory, many of which were intercepted, and that there were no casualties. Hezbollah has launched thousands of rockets into Israel in the nearly nine months since the latter began its war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza on Oct. 7. The rockets fired from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians, Israel says, while Israeli shelling has killed some 300 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and around 80 civilians, according to a Reuters tally. The relatively low number of Israeli casualties is thanks to the country's Iron Dome, a mobile all-weather defense system designed to protect Israeli territory by launching guided missiles to intercept incoming rockets and other short-range threats in midair. It has a success rate of around 90%, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The system, which became fully operational in March 2011 and has been upgraded several times since, has \"successfully prevented countless rockets from hitting Israeli communities,\" Israel's Defense Ministry says. Originally produced in Israel, the Iron Dome was developed by state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing \u2014 and Washington continues to provide funding for it today.\n\nAn Iron Dome launcher fires an interceptor missile as rockets are fired from Gaza, in Ashkelon, Israel May 10, 2023. Amir Cohen | Reuters\n\nThe Iron Dome also intercepts around 90% of the near-daily rocket attacks from Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, the IDF claims. Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 people in the besieged strip, according to Palestinian health authorities, in a bloody offensive triggered by Hamas' terror attack on Oct. 7 that killed roughly 1,200 people in Israel and took an additional 253 hostage, 116 of whom have been freed. But as Israel faces the prospect of a two-front war \u2014 with Hamas to its south and Hezbollah to its north \u2014 and with the reality that Hezbollah has an enormous arsenal of missiles and is estimated to have 10 times the military capability of Hamas, the question is: can the Iron Dome be overrun?\n\n'Payloads that Hamas could not dream of'\n\nAn all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah would be devastating for both sides. Already, at least 150,000 residents of southern Lebanon and northern Israel have been evacuated from their homes and are internally displaced because of the regular cross-border fire. Retired Israel Defense Forces Col. Miri Eisin, who directs the International Institute for Counterterrorism in Israel, said the Iron Dome would not be overrun in the sense of failing to work altogether; rather, its interception success rate will likely fall amid large-scale missile attacks, meaning more damage to Israeli infrastructure and more casualties. \"Our capabilities to intercept are very high. But the percentage will go down and that means that they will be able to hit and do damage in the heart of Israel,\" Eisin said, adding that could include vital infrastructure like power plants and the country's Tel Aviv international airport. Hezbollah \"has payloads that Hamas could not dream of,\" she said. \"I would say that there's an expectation of hundreds of killed, of thousands of casualties, and of a very challenging time period at the local level.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Lebanese Shiite organization, which was born in 1982 during Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon with funding from Iran, is now considered one of the most heavily armed nonstate groups in the world. \"Most estimates credibly put Hizbullah's missile and rocket stockpile at 150,000,\" Victor Tricaud, a senior analyst at consulting firm Control Risks, told CNBC. Hamas' rockets and missiles, by comparison, are estimated to number in the tens of thousands. More significantly, Tricaud said, Hezbollah has far more advanced weapons systems than Hamas, including Iranian-supplied guided Fateh missiles as well as drones. \"Such munitions would stand significantly greater chances to evade Israel's air defense systems \u2026 and would be likely to inflict significant damage to critical economic infrastructure across Israel,\" he said. A full-blown war would also be highly destructive for Lebanon, which is in the midst of an economic and political crisis and whose infrastructure is wholly unprepared for a new war. A major Israeli incursion and the damage it would bring, particularly to the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Lebanon, could threaten the group's standing and support there.\n\n'A hell of a lot more damage'\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah went to war in 2006, in a 34-day conflict that was claimed as a victory by Hezbollah and seen as a strategic failure in Israel. A report by Israel's Reichman University titled \"Fire and blood: The chilling reality facing Israel in a war with Hezbollah\" outlined a scenario in which Hezbollah would fire 2,500 to 3,000 missiles and rockets a day for several weeks targeting Israeli military and civilian sites. For reference, Hezbollah fired an estimated 4,000 rockets at Israel over the course of the entire 2006 war.\n\nPro-Iranian Hezbollah militants chant slogans as they walk in the beginning of the funeral procession of the party top commander Wissam tawil in the southern Lebanese village of Khirbit Selem. Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nAccording to Phillip Smyth, an expert on Iranian proxies and former senior fellow at the Washington Institute, Hezbollah's rates of fire and number of rockets launched are already \"far outpacing\" what was seen during the 2006 war.",

        "body": "US President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign event in Madison, Wisconsin, on July 5, 2024. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden insisted Friday that his damaging debate performance against former President Donald Trump was just a \"bad night,\" and not an indication of a more serious health condition. \"I was exhausted,\" Biden told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, in his first face-to-face TV interview since his raspy and disconnected debate last week. \"I didn't listen to my instincts, in terms of preparing, and [had] a bad night,\" said Biden, who also referred to his performance as a \"bad episode.\" When Stephanopoulos noted that Biden had returned from an overseas foreign policy trip in Europe about 11 days before the debate and spent six days at Camp David beforehand, Biden replied, \"I was sick, I was feeling terrible.\" Asked if he watched the debate later, Biden briefly paused and then said, \"I don't think I did, no.\" He said repeatedly that his performance was \"nobody's fault [but] mine.\" Biden also refused to entertain the idea of taking a cognitive or neurological test. \"I get a full neurological test every day,\" Biden said, referring to the rigors of the presidency. When Stephanopoulos pressed him on why he hadn't taken had any cognitive assessments, the president replied, \"No, no one said I had to.\"\n\nThe interview came on the same day that Biden defiantly rejected a growing chorus of Democrats, including top donors and allies, who are urging the 81-year-old incumbent to withdraw from the race. Biden, under aggressive questioning from Stephanopoulos about whether he is capable of either beating Trump in November or serving another four years in the White House, maintained that he believes he is up to both tasks. \"I'm running again because I think I understand best what has to be done,\" Biden said in the 23-minute interview. He appeared to foreclose any possibility of changing his mind, even in a scenario where party leaders and his close allies ask him to step aside. \"I mean, if the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race,\" he said. \"The Lord Almighty's not coming down.\" Biden said he has spoken since the debate with Democratic leaders who did not tell him to withdraw. But many Democratic lawmakers are still considering their next steps. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is holding a virtual meeting Sunday with the top Democrats on House committees, three sources told NBC News. The group is expected to focus on Biden, one of those sources told NBC. Less than a half-dozen House Democrats so far have called on Biden to drop out of the race so far, but that number could grow over the weekend. The president's remarks to Stephanopoulos echoed his earlier comments on the campaign trail that day. \"I am running and going to win again,\" Biden told a crowd of supporters during a speech in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n\"They're trying to push me out of the race,\" Biden told the crowd. \"Well let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race.\" Biden told reporters on an airport tarmac after the campaign event that he had spoken to \"at least 20\" members of Congress who are \"telling me to stay in the race.\" Biden's decision could set the campaign on a path of increasing tension with some of its top allies and donors who, spurred by concerns about Biden's health and abilities, have called for a new nominee to lead the Democratic Party into the November elections. While Biden sounded consistently louder and clearer in Friday's remarks and interview than he did in last week's debate, he still occasionally slurred or fumbled over certain words and phrases.\n\nFrustration mounts among Dems\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a longtime Biden ally, has launched a new effort to convene Democratic senators next week to discuss what Biden's path forward might be, NBC News reported. Asked on the tarmac about Warner's effort, the president dismissed it. Warner, he said, \"is the only one considering that. No one else has called me to do that.\" On Thursday, Disney heiress and longtime Democratic donor Abigail Disney told CNBC that she will withhold donations until Biden withdraws. On Wednesday, a group of business leaders corralled by the pro-Democracy Leadership Now Project urged Biden to step aside. Editorial boards of multiple newspapers, including The New York Times, have issued the same call. Questions are now swirling about how an alternative candidate, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, might take Biden's place as the new nominee. The Trump campaign and Republican Party, in turn, have started ramping up attacks on Harris. Harris told CBS News on Tuesday, \"Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once, and we're going to beat him again.

        "title": "Over $170 billion wiped off cryptocurrencies as market tanks on Mt. Gox bitcoin payout fears",
        "body": "watch now\n\nCryptocurrencies plunged Friday as investors focused on the payout of nearly $9 billion to users of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Bitcoin's price was last lower by nearly 3% to $56,571.00, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day, the world's biggest cryptocurrency had slumped as low as $53,513.55, marking its first time trading below the $55,000 level since Feb. 27. Rival token ether, meanwhile, sank around 5% to $2,971.68. At one point in time, the entire cryptocurrency market had shed more than $170 billion in combined market capitalization in a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko data. On Friday, the trustee for the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, Nobuaki Kobayashi, said in a statement that it had begun making repayments in bitcoin and bitcoin cash to some of the creditors through a number of designated crypto exchanges. Mt. Gox's trustee didn't specify how much money had been transferred to these exchanges.\n\nHe noted that the remaining funds would be returned to creditors once a series of conditions is met, including confirming the validity of registered accounts and completing discussions between the trustee and the designated crypto exchanges. The trustee is still working to ensure repayments \"can be made safely and securely,\" Kobayashi wrote, urging \"eligible rehabilitation creditors to wait for a while.\" It comes after a small amount of bitcoin was moved out of wallets associated with Mt. Gox, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, with the largest movement being a $24 transfer to the Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank. Bitbank is among the recipients listed to support repayments. Recently, the world's largest cryptocurrency has been pressured by news of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox preparing the distribution of around $9 billion worth of coins to users. This dumping of coins onto the market is expected to lead to some significant selling action. The slump in crypto prices led to hefty liquidations in the derivatives markets, according to crypto data firm Coinglass, which suggests that 229,755 traders had their positions worth a combined $639.58 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. Of this sum, $540.46 million represented long trades \u2014 financial positions taken when an investor expects the price of an asset to appreciate over the long term. Also pressuring crypto markets, the German government on Thursday sold roughly 3,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth approximately $175 million as of today's prices \u2014 from a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movie2k, according to Arkham Intelligence. Arkham, which is tracking Germany's bitcoin wallet, noted the government still holds more than 40,000 bitcoins worth over $2 billion.\n\nwatch now\n\nIndustry insiders still expect bitcoin prices to climb again toward the end of the year, once the expected near-term selling pressure from the Mt. Gox repayments lifts. Analysts at crypto data and research firm CCData said in a report Tuesday that bitcoin hadn't yet reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to hit a fresh all-time high. Historical market \"cycles\" have shown that bitcoin's so-called halving event \u2014 which cuts the supply of new bitcoins to the market \u2014 has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last between 12 and 18 months \"before producing a cycle top,\" CCData said in its report. The last bitcoin halving took place on April 19 this year, so those historical time frames have yet to pass. \"Moreover, we have observed a decline in trading activity on centralised exchanges for nearly two months following the halving event in previous cycles, which seems to have mirrored this cycle. This suggests that the current cycle could expand further into 2025,\" CCData said.\n\nwatch now\n\nTom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday that he still sees bitcoin hitting $150,000 despite the \"overhang\" from Mt. Gox's upcoming disbursement of tokens to creditors. \"If I was invested in crypto, knowing that one of the biggest overhangs is going to disappear in July, I'd think it's a reason to actually expect a pretty sharp rebound in the second half,\" Lee said. Investors are still awaiting the launch of an ether exchange-traded fund in the U.S., which would follow the approval of the first U.S. spot bitcoin ETF in January. In May, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule change that would pave the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether . VanEck, BlackRock, Bitwise and Galaxy Digital are among the companies looking to launch their own ether ETFs.",

Leon Neal | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nLONDON - Outgoing UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday said he will step down as the leader of the Conservative Party after the opposition Labour Party secured a landslide victory in Thursday's nationwide election. Sunak announced he will step down as the leader of the Conservative Party as soon as the formal arrangements for selecting his successor are in place. He then had an audience with King Charles III where he tendered his resignation as prime minister. \"This is a difficult day, at the end of a number of difficult days,\" Sunak said during a final address outside of Downing Street. \"But I leave this job honored to have been your prime minister.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nSpeaking to crowds on 10 Downing Street, Sunak said: \"I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters.\" The Conservative Party suffered its lowest result, in terms of seats, in its post-war history. The former leader and chancellor of the exchequer conceded defeat early Friday morning after Labour passed the threshold needed to govern alone.

Sunak held on to his seat in Richmond and Northallerton after winning 47.5% of the votes - a 15% drop from the previous election. But other high-profile members of parliament in the election such as Grant Shapps, the party's defense minister, and Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, failed to secure another term.\n\nwatch now",

Therefore, we will fulfil NATO's 2% goal every year,\" he said, with reference to the pledge of NATO allies to commit at least 2% of their GDP to defense spending.\n\nHe added that significantly more money would be allocated to housebuilding and affordable homes, noting that the sum would be in the \"high billions.\"\n\nAn economic growth initiative has been planned alongside the budget, Scholz said. Among other items, it aims to boost the incentive for investment, reduce bureaucracy, and ensure affordable energy, he explained.\n\nThe budget bill still faces a few months of scrutiny. Scholz on Friday confirmed that his cabinet will sign off on the plans when it next meets on July 17. But the budget must then be discussed by the German parliament after its summer break, before being finalized later in the year.\n\nNegotiations have been ongoing for weeks after spending plans shared by individual ministries exceeded constraints by billions. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner previously said some ministries had been excessive with their request.\n\n\"There are individual departments that have submitted exorbitant wish lists \u2014 Christmas, Easter and birthdays combined, so to speak,\" Lindner said in May, according to Reuters. \"That is not acceptable.\"\n\nTensions were stoked after a late-2023 constitutional court decision blew a 60-billion-euro ($64.8 billion) funding gap in the government's budgetary plans for the years ahead.\n\nThe government had been planning to re-allocate unused debt that was originally taken on as emergency funding during the Covid-19 pandemic to its ongoing spending plans.\n\nThe court ruling stopped this and threw the government into a budget crisis that prompted discussions about the country's debt brake, which restricts how much debt the federal government can take on and caps the maximum size of its structural deficit.\n\nDiscussions around the merit of the debt brake, which has been a cornerstone of German fiscal policy since 2009, have also re-emerged as part of the discussions about the budget.",

Francois Lo Presti | Afp | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 A somewhat strange and ironic political shift has gripped Europe over the last few years. In the formerly Brexiting, euroskeptic U.K., the pendulum has just swung back to the center-left Labour Party, which comes to power after a mammoth election win, ending 14 years of Conservative Party rule. A different picture is playing out in much of Western Europe \u2014 and in countries that disdained Brexit and the U.K.'s populist trend in recent years over the last decade or so. These states are now seeing their own electorates shift to the right, with nationalist, populist and euroskeptic parties riding high in voter polls and entering the corridors of power. While the U.K. and mainland Europe are heading in different directions politically, analysts say that the driving force behind changing patterns at the polls is fundamentally the same: voters are desperate for change. \"There's an anti-incumbency mood again in Europe,\" Dan Stevens, professor of politics at Exeter University, told CNBC. No matter who the incumbent is, Stevens said, \"there's just a general dissatisfaction and want for change.\" Tapping into the zeitgeist among British voters, the U.K.'s Labour Party used \"change\" as its rallying cry for voters ahead of Thursday's general election, which it won with a landslide.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe shift to the left comes after a tumultuous period in British politics during the last series of Conservative governments, with immigration concerns and euroskepticism culminating in the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. More challenges followed throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and a cost-of-living crisis. By the time the British election was called, Brits were just fed up, analysts said.\n\nShared concerns\n\nThe U.K. is not alone in looking for a political change of scenery. A similar shift has been observed in much of Western and Eastern Europe in recent years, with hard-right populist and nationalist parties upsetting and unseating the old political establishment. Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and France have all seen far-right parties \u2014 such as Fratelli d'Italia, the Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany or National Rally \u2014 rise up in opinion polls or win elections.\n\nwatch now\n\nSuch parties often emerged as protest factions, standing on an anti-immigration or euroskeptic platform, but they've since taken a more mainstream approach to attract a wider section of the electorate, who are concerned over broader universal issues such as jobs, education, health care, national identity and the economy. The latter issue is a particular driver of voting change, with rising food and energy costs and declining disposable household incomes having the most direct and decisive impact on voters. \"If you have very poor economic performance, then you would expect the political pendulum to swing, and when it swings it, it goes to the other side from where it is at present. ... It is swinging because people are hard up and aggravated. It's as simple as that,\" Christopher Granville, managing director of EMEA and global politics at TS Lombard, told CNBC, signaling that the turn of tide has not favored incumbent leaderships. \"Of course, there's a huge debate about the extent to which the respective governments are responsible for this poor economic performance. ... You can argue that they've been disastrously incompetent or you can argue that they've been innocent victims of external shocks, such as the energy crisis provoked by the war in Ukraine, the cost of living crisis etc,\" Granville added. \"Wherever you stand on that debate, the reality is the same, that the voters wants to swing the pendulum.\"\n\nProtest vote\n\nMany political experts pin the rise of the hard right in Europe on voters wanting to protest against the political status quo and its often long-standing establishment figures and parties. \"Right wing and hard-right parties are not only winning because of immigration, yes, that's their signature topic but they have been able to win because they attract a coalition of voters voting for them for different reasons,\" Sofia Vasilopoulou, professor of European politics at King's College London, told CNBC. \"They have a number of groups who are what I call 'peripheral' voters who tend to vote with them because of a lack of trust in politics, lack of trust in institutions, fatigue with the status quo,\" she said. \"It's a kind of a protest against politics in general, and there's quite a lot of voters that they get because of that.\" Political analysts point out that, although far-right political parties in France, Germany and Italy made gains in the recent European Parliament elections, they also did not perform quite as well as expected.\n\nwatch now",

Brooks | Afp | Getty Images\n\nJapanese stocks have been on a stellar run in 2024. In February, the country's benchmark Nikkei 225 smashed through its 1989 high. This week, the Nikkei and the broad-based Topix surpassed previous records to hit fresh all-time closing highs on Thursday. The Topix notably breached a 34-year record set in December 1989. How did the markets reach these level, especially for the Nikkei, which has scaled new peaks for the second time this year? Earnings are the single driver to the current market rally, Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services company Monex Group, told CNBC.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon\n\n\"Corporate Japan is now benefitting from decades of operational restructuring,\" Koll said, adding that \"breakeven points are at world record lows, so even minimal increases in top-line revenues feed explosive profit growth.\" He predicted earnings growth of 35% over the next two financial years \u2014 from April 2024 to March 2026 \u2014 as well as topline growth of 4% per year. His forecasts stem from a prediction that Japanese companies will see domestic and global sales growth, and he explained that his prediction of a 4% sales growth is due to the wage hikes announced by Japan's largest union on Thursday.\n\nwatch now\n\nJapan's largest union, commonly referred to as Rengo, announced that Japanese companies have delivered the largest wage hikes in 33 this year. Monthly pay for union-backed workers will climb 5.1% on average this fiscal year ending March 2025. Rengo also said big firms with 300 or more union-backed employees raised wages by 5.19%, while smaller firms increased pay by 4.45%. \"You do not have a shunto [wage hike] of 5% and nominal sales rising less than 4%, for example,\" he points out. More importantly, Koll said, Japan is a \"bastion of stability.\" He pointed out that its monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies are stable and pro-growth, and this acts as an important support for financial markets. When the Nikkei crossed the 40,000 mark in March, Koll told CNBC at that time that it was \"perfectly reasonable\" for the index to cross 55,000 points by the end of 2025. Koll told CNBC this week: \"I stand by my forecast \u2014 the Nikkei 225 is poised to climb to 55,000 before the end of next year.\" If his prediction comes true, it would be a 37% upside from the 40,000 mark. Previously, Koll had predicted that the Nikkei would cross 40,000 in the twelve months from July 2023. He was later proven right when the index reached that level within eight months.\n\nHow sustainable is the rally?\n\nHowever, the million dollar question will be: how long can this rally last? A note by Nomura, published Thursday, said the gains on the Nikkei and Topix do not look appear sustainable. The analysts identified that these have caused by a short covering in futures. There's a caveat though. They said \"these hasty gains could turn out to be sustained if it starts to look likely that April\u2013June corporate earnings will surprise to the upside or that the Japanese equity market will see more inflows of longer-term money.\"\n\nwatch now",

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\n\nUK Labour wins landslide victory\n\nThe center-left Labour Party has won a landslide victory, ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Early projections show that Keir Starmer's Labour will gain its second-largest majority, following former Prime Minister Tony Blair's 179-seat majority in 1997. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has conceded defeat. Brexiteer Nigel Farage has won his first seat in the British Parliament and his Reform Party is projected to pick up 13 seats.\n\nNikkei 225 hits record, Samsung up\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 hit a record high, crossing the 41,000 mark for the first time, before losing steam as household spending unexpectedly fell, jeopardizing plans by the central bank to raise interest rates. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.24% as Samsung Electronics stated second-quarter operating profit will surge almost 15-fold, mainly due to rebounding semiconductor prices driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Samsung shares climbed 2.84%, hitting their highest level since January 2021. Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 1% and mainland China's CSI 300 fell 0.48%.\n\nShort losses\n\nTesla's strong delivery report has caused significant losses for short sellers, with the stock rallying 17% in two days and short sellers losing $3.5 billion, according to S3 Partners. Tesla shares have surged 73% since April, nearing recovery with the stock $2 shy of wiping out losses for the year. Short interest is at 3.5% of the float, or 97 million shares, valued at $22.4 billion.\n\nFriday's 'slowing payroll'\n\nThe June nonfarm payrolls report takes on added significance amid signs of a slowing labor market. Payroll gains in 2024 have slowed compared to last year, with economists predicting growth of 200,000 jobs for June, down from May's 272,000. While job gains remain historically solid, rising unemployment levels and broader economic uncertainty have raised concerns about future economic weakness.\n\nSaks deal\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue parent HBC will acquire Neiman Marcus Group in a $2.65 billion deal, creating a new luxury retail giant. The combined entity will include Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks OFF 5TH, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. The move comes amid a challenging period for traditional brick-and-mortar retail, with department stores struggling to attract younger shoppers and facing a pullback in discretionary spending.\n\n[PRO] Evercore's 'best ideas'\n\nAfter a strong first-half performance for equities, fueled by the AI boom, Evercore ISI maintains its top stock picks for the second half of 2024.

        "body": "Getty Images\n\nThe European Union on Thursday confirmed its decision to hike tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China \u2014 with one automaker issuing fresh warnings that it may have to raise prices as a result. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, announced plans for such levies in June after concluding in an investigation that producers of battery EVs in China benefit from \"unfair\" subsidization. On Thursday, European regulators confirmed that these duties, which have been lightly tweaked to range from 17.4% to 37.6%, will come into effect on Friday. The levies will affect automakers from Chinese giant BYD to, potentially, European brands that make cars in China, and even U.S. giant Tesla , which has a factory in Shanghai.\n\nThe EU's decision comes at a time when Chinese automakers have been aggressively expanding into Europe with competitively priced offerings, posing a threat to the region's top automakers, many of which have lagged behind in EVs. The European Commission says these carmakers have benefitted from \"unfair subsidisation.\" Automakers have already hit back at the tariffs. On Thursday, Chinese EV maker Nio said it is currently maintaining prices for its cars sold into Europe, but added that it \"cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed.\" A spokesperson for another Chinese EV upstart, Xpeng said on Thursday that customers who are awaiting deliveries of cars, or those who place new orders before the tariffs take effect, will be \"protected from any price increases.\" It did not comment on whether it would end up raising prices as a result of the levies. Geely declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. When the EU first announced the tariffs last month, Tesla said it will likely increase the Europe prices of its Model 3 vehicle. The EU has yet to say what specific level of tariffs Tesla will face, but noted last month that the U.S. automaker \"may receive an individually calculated duty rate.\"\n\nChina-EU negotiations\n\nThe tariffs that take effect Friday are provisional and last for four months. In that time, EU member states must vote on so-called \"definitive duties,\" which would last five years.\n\nwatch now\n\nChinese and EU officials have held several rounds of meetings to discuss the tariffs, with Beijing in June criticizing the EU's imposition of tariffs as a \"protectionist act.\" Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong said on Thursday that he hopes the two sides will \"meet each other halfway, show sincerity, speed up the consultation process, and, on the basis of rules and reality, reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible.\"\n\nChinese EV maker committed to Europe",

        "body": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year. STR | Nurphoto via Getty Images\n\nBitcoin's price slumped to around $57,000 apiece Thursday, hitting a two-month low after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes from its June meeting indicating the central bank isn't yet ready to cut interest rates. At around 2:30 p.m. London time, the digital currency fell around 5% in 24 hours to $56,837, falling below the $57,000 mark for the first time since May 1, according to data from crypto ranking site CoinGecko. Since then, bitcoin has pared losses somewhat and was trading at $57,932.57, down 3.4% as of 5:05 p.m. London time. Rival token ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, was down 5% at $3,120.\n\nIt comes after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday released minutes from its June meeting which showed officials are reluctant to lower interest rates until additional data shows inflation moving sustainably toward the central bank's 2% target. Higher interest rates are typically less favorable for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it dampens investor risk appetite. Bitcoin stormed to an all-time high of above $73,700 in March this year after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF.\n\nETFs allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Crypto proponents say this has helped legitimize the asset class and make it easier for larger institutional investors to get involved. Since then, however, bitcoin has been trading within a range between roughly $59,000 and $72,000. Recently, the world's largest cryptocurrency has been pressured by news of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox readying the distribution of around $9 billion worth of coins to users, which is expected to lead to some significant selling action.\n\nwatch now\n\nOn Thursday, a small amount of bitcoin was moved from three wallets previously associated with Mt. Gox, according to Arkham Intelligence. The largest movement was for $24 worth of the cryptocurrency. It was not immediately clear if this transaction was made in connection with the Mt. Gox repayment plan. Elsewhere, the German government on Thursday sold roughly 3,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth approximately $175 million as of today's prices \u2014 from a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movie2k, according to blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence . Arkham, which is tracking the German government's bitcoin wallet, said that the assets were moved to crypto exchanges Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase, as well as an separate, unidentified wallet. \"These funds are likely moving to a deposit for an institutional service or OTC,\" Arkham said in a post on X.\n\nCan bitcoin still gain from here?\n\nHowever, analysts at crypto data and research firm CCData said in a research report Tuesday that bitcoin hasn't yet reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to hit a fresh all-time high. According to the report, historical market \"cycles\" have shown that bitcoin's so-called \"halving\" event \u2014 which cuts the supply of new bitcoins to the market \u2014 has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last between 12 to 18 months \u201cbefore producing a cycle top.\u201d\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing celebrates the 24th anniversary of its listing on June 21, 2024. China News Service | China News Service | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 The market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years, starting in the second half of this year, George Chan, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday. \"I think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak [in 2021] but the trend is there,\" Chan said. \"I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\" High U.S. interest rates, regulatory scrutiny, slower economic growth and U.S.-China tensions have constrained Greater China IPOs in the last three years. EY said in a report that while the volume of IPOs and proceeds in the U.S. increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, mainland China and Hong Kong saw a sharp decline in listings. Many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around, which can support more IPOs in Hong Kong, said Chan, who is based in Shanghai. \"We are seeing a reversing trend,\" he told CNBC. \"We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong. The main reason is that Hong Kong has already factored in these uncertainties.\" The Hang Seng Index is up more than 5% year-to-date after four straight years of decline \u2014 which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index, according to Wind Information.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon\n\n\"Our HK cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for H2. We expect to see many HKSE listings,\" Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster in Hong Kong, said in an email Wednesday. Many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland China's A share market have decided to switch to one in Hong Kong, she said. \"Previously [China Securities Regulatory Commission] approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten CSRC approvals pretty quickly.\" In June, China issued new measures to promote venture capital, and authorities spoke publicly about supporting IPOs, especially in Hong Kong. Investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of IPO approvals for signs of a significant change. Chan said another supportive factor for Hong Kong IPOs is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland China, where economic growth is \"quite satisfactory.\" He expects consumer companies could be among the near-term IPO beneficiaries. \"As the economy slowly recovers, a lot of people in China are willing to spend,\" he said, noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country. Official national-level data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in China \u2014 up by just 3.7% in May from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10% or more in prior years. Also significant for global asset allocation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes. High rates have made Treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of IPOs. \"I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,\" Chan said. Hong Kong IPOs raised $1.5 billion during the first half of the year, a 34% drop from a year ago, EY said in a report released late last month. Back in 2021 and 2020, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saw nearly 100 or more IPOs a year raising tens of billions of dollars, according to the report. In comparison, mainland China IPOs raised $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 \u2014 a drop of 85% from the year-ago period, according to EY.\n\nwatch now\n\nBonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said during a conference last week that so far this year, the Hong Kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications \u2014 a 50% increase compared to the second half of last year. She is not related to EY's George Chan. \"The pipeline is building up nicely,\" she said, noting about 110 IPOs in total are in line for a Hong Kong listing. \"All we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely,\" she added.\n\nImproving post-IPO performance\n\n\"What we need is a strong pipeline,\" EY's Chan said. \"We need an interested investor with the money to invest, and we need a good aftermarket performance.\" Hong Kong IPO returns are improving. The average first-day return of new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24%, far more than the average of 1% in the same period last year, according to EY. \"The aftermarket performance of Hong Kong IPOs has been doing quite good compared to the past five years,\" Chan said. \"These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.\" Chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024.\n\nwatch now\n\nHe said those will likely be medium-sized \u2014 between 2 billion Hong Kong dollars to 5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($260 million to $640 million) \u2014 but added he expects better market momentum in 2025. Slowing economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty have also weighed on early-stage investment into Chinese startups. Total venture funding from foreign investors into Greater China deals plunged to $19 billion in 2023, down from $67 billion in 2021, according to Preqin, an alternative assets research firm. U.S. investors have not participated in the largest deals in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, the firm said in a report last month.\n\nU.S. IPO outlook",
        "summary": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing celebrates the 24th anniversary of its listing on June 21, 2024.\n\"We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong.\n\"I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,\" Chan said.\nHong Kong IPO returns are improving.\n\"These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.\"",

Officials at the meeting said data has improved lately, though they are want more evidence that it will continue.\n\nMeeting participants \"emphasized that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate until additional information had emerged to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee's 2 percent objective.\"\n\nAt the meeting, policymakers also provided an update on economic projections and monetary policy over the next several years.\n\nThe FOMC \"dot plot\" showed one quarter percentage point cut by the end of 2024, down from the three indicated following the last update in March. Even though the dot plot indicated one cut this year, futures markets continue to price in two, starting in September.\n\nAlso, the committee largely left its economic projections intact, though they lowered their inflation expectations for this year.\n\nIn discussions over how they would approach monetary policy, the minutes reflected some disagreements. Some members noted the need to tighten the reins should inflation persist, while others made the case that they should be ready to respond should the economy falter or the labor market weaken.\n\n\"Several participants observed that, were inflation to persist at an elevated level or to increase further, the target range for the federal funds rate might need to be raised,\" the minutes stated. \"A number of participants remarked that monetary policy should stand ready to respond to unexpected economic weakness.\"\n\nThe minutes do not identify individual members nor do they provide exact amounts for the number of officials expressing particular viewpoints. However, in the Fed parlance, \"a number\" is considered more than \"several.\"\n\nThe summary also noted a \"vast majority\" saw economic growth \"gradually cooling\" and that the current policy is \"restrictive,\" a key term as the officials contemplate how restrictive policy needs to be while bringing down inflation and not causing undue economic harm.\n\nSince the meeting, officials have largely stuck to a cautious script stressing data dependency rather than forecasts. However, there have been indications from multiple officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, that continued encouraging readings on inflation would provide confidence that rates can be lowered.\n\nIn an appearance Tuesday in Portugal, Powell said the risks of cutting too soon and risking a resurgence in inflation against cutting too late and endangering economic growth have come more into balance. Previously, officials had stressed the importance of not backing off the inflation fight too soon.",

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump, left, and President Joe Biden face off in the first debate of the 2024 presidential campaign, in Atlanta, June 27, 2024. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nThe recent U.S. presidential debate saw both candidates trade barbs related to the economy. High pandemic-era inflation was among the grievances. \"He caused the inflation,\" Trump said of Biden during the June 27 debate. \"I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation,\" he added. Biden countered by saying inflation was low during Trump's term because the economy \"was flat on its back.\" \"He decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy,\" Biden said.\n\nwatch now\n\nBut the cause of inflation isn't so black-and-white, economists say. In fact, Biden and Trump are not responsible for much of the inflation consumers have experienced in recent years, they said.\n\n'Neither Trump nor Biden is to blame'\n\nGlobal events beyond Trump's or Biden's control wreaked havoc on supply-and-demand dynamics in the U.S. economy, fueling higher prices, economists said. There were other factors, too. The Federal Reserve, which acts independently from the Oval Office, was slow to act to contain hot inflation, for example. Some Biden and Trump policies such as pandemic relief packages also likely played a role, as might have so-called \"greedflation.\" \"I don't think it's a simple yes/no kind of answer,\" said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank. \"In general, presidents get more credit and blame for the economy than they deserve,\" he said. More from Personal Finance:\n\nTrump may roll back student loan forgiveness programs if elected\n\nWhat a Supreme Court ruling could mean for Biden's 'billionaire tax'\n\nBiden, Trump accuse each other of ruining Social Security, Medicare That Biden is seen as stoking high inflation is due somewhat to optics: He took office in early 2021, around the time inflation spiked notably, economists said. Likewise, the Covid-19 pandemic plunged the U.S. into a severe recession during Trump's tenure, pulling the consumer price index to near zero in spring 2020 as unemployment ballooned and consumers cut spending. \"In my view, neither Trump nor Biden is to blame for the high inflation,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The blame goes to the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe big reasons inflation spiked\n\nInflation has many tentacles. At a high level, hot inflation is largely an issue of mismatched supply and demand. The pandemic upended the typical dynamics. For one, it disrupted global supply chains. There were labor shortages: Illness sidelined workers. Child-care centers closed, making it hard for parents to work. Others were worried about getting sick on the job. A decline in immigration also reduced worker supply, economists said. China shut down factories and cargo ships couldn't be unloaded at ports, for example, reducing the supply of goods. Meanwhile, consumers changed their buying patterns. They bought more physical stuff such as living room furniture and desks for their home offices as they spent more time indoors \u2014 a departure from pre-pandemic norms, when Americans tended to spend more money on services such as dining out, travel, and going to movies and concerts.\n\nCargo containers sit stacked on ships at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s busiest container port, in San Pedro, California, on Oct. 15, 2021. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nHigh demand, which boomed when the U.S. economy reopened broadly, coupled with goods shortages fueled higher prices. There were other related factors, too. For example, automakers didn't have enough semiconductor chips necessary to build cars, while rental car companies sold off their fleets because they didn't think the recession would be short-lived, making it pricier to rent when the economy rebounded quickly, Wessel said. As Covid cases were hitting record highs heading into 2022, further disrupting supply chains, Russia's war in Ukraine \"supercharged\" inflation by stoking higher prices for commodities such as oil and food around the world, Zandi said. As a result, global inflation hit a level \"higher than seen in several decades,\" the International Monetary Fund wrote in October 2022. \"We only have to look at the still high inflation rates in most other advanced economies to see that most of this inflation period was really about global trends ... rather than about the specific policy actions of any given government (though they did of course play some role),\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist for Capital Economics, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nBig spending bills' impact 'only clear in hindsight'\n\nHowever, Biden and Trump aren't entirely without fault: They greenlit additional government spending in the pandemic era that contributed to inflation, for example, economists said. For example, the American Rescue Plan \u2014 the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Biden signed in March 2021\u2014 offered $1,400 stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and a larger child tax credit to households, in addition to other relief. The policy led to \"some good things,\" such as a strong job market and low unemployment, said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. But its magnitude was greater than the U.S. economy needed at the time, serving to raise prices by putting more money in consumers' pockets, which fueled demand, he said. \"I do think President Biden bears some responsibility for the inflation that we've been living through for the past few years,\" Strain said.\n\nHe estimated the American Rescue Plan added about 2 percentage points to underlying inflation. The consumer price index peaked around 9% in June 2022, the highest since 1981. It's since declined to 3.3% as of May 2024. The Federal Reserve \u2014 the U.S. central bank \u2014 aims for a long-term inflation rate near 2%. \"I think if it weren't for the American Rescue Plan, the U.S. still would have had inflation,\" Strain added. \"So I think it's important not to overstate the situation.\" However, Zandi viewed the ARP's inflationary impact as \"good\" and \"desirable,\" bringing the economy back to the Fed's long-term target inflation rate after a prolonged period of below-average inflation. Trump had also authorized two stimulus packages, in March and December 2020, worth about $3 trillion. These so-called \"fiscal policy\" responses were insurance against a lousy economic recovery, perhaps overshooting after the U.S.' lackluster response to the Great Recession that mired the nation in high unemployment for years, Wessel said. That the U.S. issued perhaps too much stimulus was the presidents' fault but \"only clear in hindsight,\" he said. Biden and Trump also enacted other policies that may contribute to higher prices, economists said. For example, Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and several goods from China, which Biden largely kept intact. Biden also set new import taxes on Chinese goods such as electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\nThe Fed and 'greedflation'",

        "body": "Pictured here is a stone with tungsten ore inside a mine in Germany run by Saxony Minerals and Exploration. Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China dominates the supply chain for many of the world's critical minerals, but so far it's held off on sweeping restrictions on at least one: tungsten. The metal is nearly as hard as diamond and has a high energy density. That's made tungsten an important material in weapons, autos, electric car batteries, semiconductors and industrial cutting machines. Chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia both use the metal. \"I don't expect any saber-rattling over tungsten,\" said Lewis Black, CEO of Canada-based Almonty Industries, which is spending at least $75 million to reopen a tungsten mine in South Korea later this year. \"If you get too belligerent about diversification, [it becomes a situation that's] biting the hand that feeds you,\" he said, adding that \"tungsten has always been a diplomatic metal.\" While the Biden administration raised tariffs on imports of tungsten in May, China this past weekend did not include the metal in new regulations for boosting its oversight of domestic rare earths production.\n\nBut China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs... They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise. Lewis Black CEO of Almonty\n\n\"The tariffs were more of a warning shot, as Biden only put tariffs on three of the 25 strategic metals China exports,\" Black said. \"But China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs, unlike in the past when they restricted some exports of rare earths. They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise.\" Asked last month if China would retaliate to the latest U.S. tariffs on tungsten, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong didn't announce countermeasures. Instead, he called on the U.S. to remove the additional duties. Commodity price reporting and analytics company Fastmarkets pointed out earlier this year that China has reduced national production quotas for its tungsten mines due to environmental restrictions.\n\nDiversifying away from China\n\nStill, Black expects his company to benefit from growing efforts to diversify away from China. Almonty claims the forthcoming mine in South Korea has the potential to produce 50% of the world's ex-China tungsten supply. Demand for non-Chinese tungsten is already on the rise. \"We see in the U.S., in Europe, they ask their suppliers for a China-free supply chain,\" said Michael Dornhofer, founder of metals consulting firm Independent Supply Business Partner.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe U.S. REEShore Act \u2014 or Restoring Essential Energy and Security Holdings Onshore for Rare Earths Act of 2022 \u2014 prohibits the use of Chinese tungsten in military equipment starting in 2026, while the European Commission last year extended tariffs on imported Chinese tungsten carbide for another five years, Almonty Industries pointed out in a report. The House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party last month announced a new working group on the U.S. critical minerals policy.\n\nSoaring tungsten prices\n\nExpectations for higher demand and limited supplies of tungsten have pushed prices to multi-year highs, although they have tapered off in the last several weeks. Dornhofer said in an interview in late May that he was also seeing Chinese buyers increasing their tungsten purchases. \"Since the beginning of this year, they are not only asking for Western concentrate, but they are buying significant volumes, paying even more than Western companies are willing to pay,\" he said. \"Definitely [going to be] a game changer.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBack in January, U.S.-based research firm Macro Ops said: \"We're approaching an inflection point in tungsten supply. The US will quickly run out of stockpiled tungsten and flip from net seller to buyer over the next 12-18 months.\" The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on this story. Brandon Beylo, head of investment research at Macro Ops, told CNBC in an email there are only six companies in the U.S. with capacity to produce tungsten. He added that the U.S. hasn't produced tungsten domestically since 2015, meaning future U.S. supply must come from overseas. He said the firm doesn't own tungsten-related stocks, but that he's personally looking for ways to access the physical commodity. There are no futures for trading tungsten.\n\nOther tungsten players going to South Korea\n\nChina dominates over 80% of the tungsten supply chain, although local production costs are rising as the mines age, according to Argus, noting Chinese imports of the metal from North Korea, central Africa and Myanmar. \"This presents an opportunity for projects outside China,\" Mark Seddon, principal, consulting and analytics at Argus, said in a June 28 webinar. Other non-Chinese companies in the tungsten supply chain are going to South Korea. In February, IMC Endmill, an affiliate of Warren Buffett-owned IMC Group, signed an agreement with the Daegu city government for a 130 billion Korean won ($93.6 million) investment in a tungsten powder manufacturing facility, according to a local news report. IMC Group did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "watch now\n\nWhen Natasha Craft first got a Yotta banking account in 2021, she loved using it so much she told her friends to sign up. The app made saving money fun and easy, and Craft, a now 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana, was busy getting her financial life in order and planning a wedding. Craft had her wages deposited directly into a Yotta account and used the startup's debit card to pay for all her expenses. The app \u2014 which gamifies personal finance with weekly sweepstakes and other flashy features \u2014 even occasionally covered some of her transactions. \"There were times I would go buy something and get that purchase for free,\" Craft told CNBC. Today, her entire life savings \u2014 $7,006 \u2014 is locked up in a complicated dispute playing out in bankruptcy court, online forums like Reddit and regulatory channels. And Yotta, an array of other startups and their banks have been caught in a moment of reckoning for the fintech industry. For customers, fintech promised the best of both worlds: The innovation, ease of use and fun of the newest apps combined with the safety of government-backed accounts held at real banks. The startups prominently displayed protections afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., lending credibility to their novel offerings. After all, since its 1934 inception, no depositor \"has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits,\" according to the agency's website. But the widening fallout over the collapse of a fintech middleman called Synapse has revealed that promise of safety as a mirage. Starting May 11, more than 100,000 Americans with $265 million in deposits were locked out of their accounts. Roughly 85,000 of those customers were at Yotta alone, according to the startup's co-founder, Adam Moelis. CNBC reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the Synapse debacle. They come from all walks and stages of life, from Craft, the Indiana FedEx driver; to the owner of a chain of preschools in Oakland, California; a talent analyst for Disney living in New York City; and a computer engineer in Santa Barbara, California. A high school teacher in Maryland. A parent in Bristol, Connecticut, who opened an account for his daughter. A social worker in Seattle saving up for dental work after Adderall abuse ruined her teeth.\n\n'A reckoning underway'\n\nSince Yotta, like most popular fintech apps, wasn't itself a bank, it relied on partner institutions including Tennessee-based Evolve Bank & Trust to offer checking accounts and debit cards. In between Yotta and Evolve was a crucial middleman, Synapse, keeping track of balances and monitoring fraud. Founded in 2014 by a first-time entrepreneur named Sankaet Pathak, Synapse was a player in the \"banking-as-a-service\" segment alongside companies like Unit and Synctera. Synapse helped customer-facing startups like Yotta quickly access the rails of the regulated banking industry. It had contracts with 100 fintech companies and 10 million end users, according to an April court filing. Until recently, the BaaS model was a growth engine that seemed to benefit everybody. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks, startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer. The small banks that catered to them got a source of deposits in a time dominated by giants like JPMorgan Chase . But in May, Synapse, in the throes of bankruptcy, turned off a critical system that Yotta's bank used to process transactions. In doing so, it threw thousands of Americans into financial limbo, and a growing segment of the fintech industry into turmoil. \"There is a reckoning underway that involves questions about the banking-as-a-service model,\" said Michele Alt, a former lawyer for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a current partner at consulting firm Klaros Group. She believes the Synapse failure will prove to be an \"aberration,\" she added. The most popular finance apps in the country, including Block's Cash App, PayPal and Chime, partner with banks instead of owning them. They account for 60% of all new fintech account openings, according to data provider Curinos. Block and PayPal are publicly traded; Chime is expected to launch an IPO next year. Block, PayPal and Chime didn't provide comment for this article.\n\n'Deal directly with a bank'\n\nWhile industry experts say those firms have far more robust ledgering and daily reconciliation abilities than Synapse, they may still be riskier than direct bank relationships, especially for those relying on them as a primary account. \"If it's your spending money, you need to be dealing directly with a bank,\" Scott Sanborn, CEO of LendingClub , told CNBC. \"Otherwise, how do you, as a consumer, know if the conditions are met to get FDIC coverage?\" Sanborn knows both sides of the fintech divide: LendingClub started as a fintech lender that partnered with banks until it bought Boston-based Radius in early 2020 for $185 million, eventually becoming a fully regulated bank.\n\nScott Sanborn, LendingClub CEO Getty Images\n\nSanborn said acquiring Radius Bank opened his eyes to the risks of the \"banking-as-a-service\" space. Regulators focus not on Synapse and other middlemen, but on the banks they partner with, expecting them to monitor risks and prevent fraud and money laundering, he said. But many of the tiny banks running BaaS businesses like Radius simply don't have the personnel or resources to do the job properly, Sanborn said. He shuttered most of the lender's fintech business as soon as he could, he says. \"We are one of those people who said, 'Something bad is going to happen,'\" Sanborn said. A spokeswoman for the Financial Technology Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing large players including Block, PayPal and Chime, said in a statement that it is \"inaccurate to claim that banks are the only trusted actors in financial services.\" \"Consumers and small businesses trust fintech companies to better meet their needs and provide more accessible, affordable, and secure services than incumbent providers,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Established fintech companies are well-regulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds,\" she said. Furthermore, regulators ought to take a \"risk-based approach\" to supervising fintech-bank partnerships, she added. The implications of the Synapse disaster may be far-reaching. Regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs, and that will undoubtedly continue. Evolve itself was reprimanded by the Federal Reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships.\n\nIn a post-Synapse update, the FDIC made it clear that the failure of nonbanks won't trigger FDIC insurance, and that even when fintechs partner with banks, customers may not have their deposits covered. The FDIC's exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage: \"The short answer is: it depends.\"\n\nFDIC safety net\n\nWhile their circumstances all differed vastly, each of the customers CNBC spoke to for this story had one thing in common: They thought the FDIC backing of Evolve meant that their funds were safe. \"For us, it just felt like they were a bank,\" the Oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider, a tuition processor called Curacubby. \"You'd tell them what to bill, they bill it. They'd communicate with parents, and we get the money.\" The 62-year-old business owner, who asked CNBC to withhold her name because she didn't want to alarm employees and parents of her schools, said she's taken out loans and tapped credit lines after $236,287 in tuition was frozen in May. Now, the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out. \"I'm assuming I probably won't see that money,\" she said, \"And if I do, how long is it going to take?\" When Rick Davies, a 46-year-old lead engineer for a men's clothing company that owns online brands including Taylor Stitch, signed up for an account with crypto app Juno, he says he \"distinctly remembers\" being comforted by seeing the FDIC logo of Evolve. \"It was front and center on their website,\" Davies said. \"They made it clear that it was Evolve doing the banking, which I knew as a fintech provider. The whole package seemed legit to me.\" He's now had roughly $10,000 frozen for weeks, and says he's become enraged that the FDIC hasn't helped customers yet. For Davies, the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize Silicon Valley Bank last year, protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process. His employer banked with SVB, which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse, so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress. \"The dichotomy between the FDIC stepping in extremely quickly for San Francisco-based tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar, more consumer-oriented situation is infuriating,\" Davies said. The key difference with SVB is that none of the banks linked with Synapse have failed, and because of that, the regulator hasn't moved to help impacted users. Consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of FDIC protection, said Alt, the former OCC lawyer. \"What consumers understood was, 'This is as safe as money in the bank,'\" Alt said. \"But the FDIC insurance isn't a pot of money to generally make people whole, it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole.\"\n\nWaiting for their money\n\nFor the customers involved in the Synapse mess, the worst-case scenario is playing out. While some customers have had funds released in recent weeks, most are still waiting. Those later in line may never see a full payout: There is a shortfall of up to $96 million in funds that are owed to customers, according to the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. That's because of Synapse's shoddy ledgers and its system of pooling users' money across a network of banks in ways that make it difficult to reconstruct who is owed what, according to court filings. The situation is so tangled that Jelena McWilliams, a former FDIC chairman now acting as trustee over the Synapse bankruptcy, has said that finding all the customer money may be impossible. Despite weeks of work, there appears to be little progress toward fixing the hardest part of the Synapse mess: Users whose funds were pooled in \"for benefit of,\" or FBO, accounts. The technique has been used by brokerages for decades to give wealth management customers FDIC coverage on their cash, but its use in fintech is more novel. \"If it's in an FBO account, you don't even know who the end customer is, you just have this giant account,\" said LendingClub's Sanborn. \"You're trusting the fintech to do the work.\" While McWilliams has floated a partial payment to end users weeks ago, an idea that has support from Yotta co-founder Moelis and others, that hasn't happened yet. Getting consensus from the banks has proven difficult, and the bankruptcy judge has openly mused about which regulator or body of government can force them to act. The case is \"uncharted territory,\" Judge Martin Barash said, and because depositors' funds aren't the property of the Synapse estate, Barash said it wasn't clear what his court could do. Evolve has said in filings that it has \"great pause\" about making any payments until a full reconciliation happens. It has further said that Synapse ledgers show that nearly all of the deposits held for Yotta were missing, while Synapse has said that Evolve holds the funds. \"I don't know who's right or who's wrong,\" Moelis told CNBC. \"We know how much money came into the system, and we are certain that that's the correct number. The money doesn't just disappear; it has to be somewhere.\" In the meantime, the former Synapse CEO and Evolve have had an eventful few weeks. Pathak, who dialed into early bankruptcy hearings while in Santorini, Greece, has since been attempting to raise funds for a new robotics startup, using marketing materials with misleading claims about its ties with automaker General Motors. And only days after being censured by the Federal Reserve about its management of technology partners, Evolve was attacked by Russian hackers who posted user data from an array of fintech firms, including Social Security numbers, to a dark web forum for criminals.\n\nNatasha Craft, a 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana.

        "body": "Taylor Swift performs on stage during The Eras Tour on June 28, 2024 in Dublin, Ireland. Charles Mcquillan/tas24 | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nTaylor Swift's European tour was top of mind for Nikita Rao when planning where to go for her family's annual summer vacation. Rao, her husband and two kids, who live in Bethesda, Maryland, headed overseas this past weekend: They have tickets to the pop star's concert in Amsterdam on Thursday. The family built a weeklong itinerary around The Eras Tour event, spending a few days in London before making their way to the Netherlands for the show. They would have likely visited the two cities at some point in the future, but the Swift concert accelerated their timeline, said Rao, 43, who also saw a performance in Cincinnati last year with her daughter. \"My view on it was, we should do this \u2014 London and Amsterdam \u2014 because she'll be there,\" Rao said. \"If I can get tickets, that'll just make the whole vacation amazing,\" she said of her thought process.\n\nWhy Taylor Swift is unique to 'passion tourism'\n\nTaylor Swift fans gather outside Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium for a concert in Madrid, Spain, on May 29, 2024. David Benito | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nIt's not just the Rao family. Americans are flocking overseas to see Taylor Swift, perhaps the most prominent recent example of so-called \"passion tourism,\" according to travel experts. Passion tourism revolves (unsurprisingly) around people's passions. While place is also generally important, these trips are generally guided by personal interest, hobby or a cultural event, experts said. This isn't a new concept. In fact, there are many recent and upcoming examples: February's annual Carnival festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; April's total solar eclipse in North America; the 2024 Paris Olympics that start this month; and the ongoing UEFA European Football Championship (known as the Euro Cup) in Germany. \"Memorable events are driving travel trends, whether it is for concerts or sporting events,\" Mastercard wrote recently in its annual travel trends report. More from Personal Finance:\n\nFlying is cheaper in 2024. But not for some destinations\n\nVacationers expect to carry summer travel debt\n\n5 ways to maximize your vacation days However, what distinguishes Taylor Swift concerts in the realm of passion tourism is the broad interest and enthusiasm among Americans who want to travel abroad, according to travel agents. \"I've never seen this excitement to travel to go see an artist,\" said Jessica Griscavage, a travel advisor and founder of Runway Travel. The most recent example that might come close is a Spice Girls concert in the 1990s, she said. Griscavage, who put together the Rao family's itinerary, also assembled a separate Swift-centered trip to Paris for a daughter, mother and grandmother. More than half of Americans, 53%, identify as fans of Taylor Swift, according to a poll by Morning Consult. About 16% consider themselves \"avid\" fans.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it,'\" said Sofia Markovich, a travel advisor and founder of Sofia's Travel. She assembled trips for two U.S. clients who had tickets for Taylor Swift shows in England and Switzerland, respectively. \"Just as Grateful Dead fans were known to follow the band from city to city to be part of a unique community, Swifties \u2014 often with friends and family in tow \u2014 have made traveling to her concerts part of the experience,\" Joshua Friedlander, vice president of research at the U.S. Travel Association, wrote recently about the so-called \"Swift Lift.\"\n\n'Inevitable' that Swifties will travel to new places\n\nAbout 15.9 million Americans traveled internationally in the first quarter of 2024, an all-time high, according to Mastercard's travel report. Consumers are also spending for travel at record levels globally, it said. Passion tourism generally provides an economic boost to host nations, experts said. For example, spending by tourists at restaurants, bars and grocery stores during the 2024 Carnival in Rio was 156% above normal, Mastercard found. During the solar eclipse, hotel sales within the U.S. path of totality rose 71%, it said.\n\nSpectators looking up at the solar eclipse at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 8, 2024. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nAbout 1.2 million fans will see a Taylor Swift concert this summer across four cities in the United Kingdom (Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London), according to a recent Barclays analysis. Each fan will spend an average 848 British pounds (about $1,073) on tickets, travel, accommodation, outfits and other expenses, amounting to a total 997 million British pounds (about $1.3 billion), Barclays estimated. Accommodation accounts for the largest outlay after tickets, followed by travel, according to the Barclays analysis. Searches for Airbnb stays in European cities during Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour dates are up about 70% relative to the same period in 2023, according to a recent analysis.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it.' Sofia Markovich travel advisor\n\nRome and Paris are traditionally among Americans' top destinations to visit abroad. However, it's \"inevitable\" that Swift fans will end up in a city they may have previously overlooked, like Edinburgh, said Christopher Nulty, global head of corporate communications and public affairs at Airbnb. When tickets went on sale last year for Edinburgh concert dates, searches for lodging in the city by Americans jumped 500%, Nulty said. A concert \"combines the opportunity to travel somewhere incredible with the opportunity to see an artist they love,\" he said.",

Regulators are \"still working on it,\" he added, but so far haven't raised any outstanding concerns with the fintech.\n\nStoronsky noted that Revolut's huge size has meant that it's taken longer for the company to get its banking license approved than would have been the case for smaller companies. Several small financial institutions have been able to win approval for a banking license with few customers, he added.\n\n\"U.K. banking licenses are being approved for smaller companies,\" Storonsky said. \"They usually approve someone twice every year,\" and they typically tend to be smaller institutions. \"Of course, we are very large, so it takes extra time.\"\n\nRevolut is a licensed electronic money institution, or EMI, in the U.K. But it can't yet offer lending products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. A bank license would enable it to offer loans in the U.K. The firm has faced lengthy delays to its application, which it filed in 2021.\n\nOne key issue the company faced was with its share structure being inconsistent with the rulebook of the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body for the financial services industry that sits under the Bank of England.\n\nRevolut has multiple classes of shares and some of those share classes previously had preferential rights attached. One conditions set by the Bank of England for granting Revolut its U.K. banking license, was to collapse its six classes of shares into ordinary shares.\n\nRevolut has since resolved this, with the company striking a deal with Japanese tech investor SoftBank to transfer its shares in the firm to a unified class, relinquishing preferential rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the resolution with SoftBank was first reported by the Financial Times.",

        "body": "Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.\n\n\"We are at what is widely viewed as a real inflection point in the evolution of technology, with the rise of large language models. Some are convinced that within three years almost everything we do as humans will be done in one form or another by LLMs and other AI tools,\" Griffin said Friday during an event for Citadel's new class of interns in New York. \"For a number of reasons, I am not convinced that these models will achieve that type of breakthrough in the near future.\"\n\nThe rapid rise of AI has had the world pondering its far-reaching impact on society, including technology-induced job cuts. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is among many who have repeatedly warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity. He has called AI \"more dangerous\" than nuclear weapons, saying there will come a point where \"no job is needed.\"\n\nGriffin, whose hedge fund and electronic market maker have been at the forefront of automation, said machine-learning tools do have their limits when it comes to adapting to changes.\n\n\"Machine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift. Self-driving cars don't work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do,\" Griffin said. \"Machine learning models do much better when there's consistency.\"\n\nStill, the billionaire investor thinks the power of advanced technology can't be dismissed in the long term, and he even sees cancer being eradicated one day because of it.\n\n\"The rise of computing power is allowing us to solve all kinds of problems that were just simply not solvable five, 10, 15 years ago,\" Griffin said. \"This is going to radically transform healthcare. We will end cancer as you know it in your lifetime.\"\n\nCitadel has long placed a great emphasis on hiring, not hesitant about putting responsibility into the hands of young employees and even interns, the CEO said.\n\nThe firm's internship program has become one of the most competitive in the country. More than 85,000 students applied for about 300 positions this year, reflecting an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%, which is lower than that of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"The people we hire today are going to be the leaders of Citadel not in 30 or 40 years, but in just a few years,\" Griffin said.",

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that \"concentrated\" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 make up about 31% of the index, it said.\n\n'A bit riskier than people realize'\n\nSome experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration \"is a bit riskier than people realize,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. \"Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,\" he said. \"You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.\"\n\nWhy stock concentration may not be a concern\n\nThe S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 \u2014 more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:\n\nAmericans struggle to shake off a 'vibecession'\n\nRetirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances\n\nHouseholds have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's \"rare\" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.\n\nThere's precedent for this market concentration\n\nAdditionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.\n\nThe stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when \"stocks did just fine,\" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. \"We've been here before,\" he said. \"And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news.\" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 \u2014 better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n'Sometimes you can be surprised'\n\nBig U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders \"generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity\" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven \"are not pie-in-the-sky\" companies: They're generating \"tremendous\" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \"How much more gain can be made is the question,\" he added.\n\nYou're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.

        "body": "The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares \u2014 amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.\n\nThe rally in Chewy shares lost steam Monday as traders reacted to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that showed meme stock trader \"Roaring Kitty\" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.\n\nThe SEC filing also included a section that read: \"Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat.\" There was an \"x\" next to a response that read: \"I am not a cat.\" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.\n\nThe stock rallied more than 9% on Monday, but it quickly fell into negative territory in morning trading. Shares ended the day down 6.6%.\n\nChewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. The shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.\n\nCNBC emailed Chewy's public relations team seeking comment on the new shareholder.\n\nGill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.\n\nGameStop shares fell more than 5% following the news.\n\n\n\nThere's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was founder and the first CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nIn a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's also been leading a pivot to e-commerce.\n\nThe investor was hit by a new class-action lawsuit filed Friday, alleging he engaged in securities fraud by manipulating GameStop's stock price through his online influence in May and June. The case was voluntarily dismissed on Monday.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.",

        "body": "In this article RACE-IT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIn the world of luxury, Herm\u00e8s is arguably the gold standard. Its sales are growing double digits even as other luxury companies post declines or dramatically slower growth. Wealthy customers lucky enough to be anointed as Birkin-bag worthy can purchase a Birkin 25 for about $11,000 and flip it the same day for more than $23,000. Analysts predict Herm\u00e8s could surpass Louis Vuitton in revenue within the next three years as the world's largest luxury brand. Herm\u00e8s stock is up 13% this year, while LVMH shares are flat and Kering is down 18%. There is one luxury company, however, that has raced past Herm\u00e8s when it comes to growth and brand cache \u2013 Ferrari. This year, Ferrari for the first time surpassed Herm\u00e8s as the most valuable luxury company in the world as measured by stock multiple, which gauges growth and profit prospects. Ferrari's stock now trades at 50 times earnings, compared with 48 for Herm\u00e8s and 23 for LVMH.\n\nThe storied automaker, founded in 1947 by Enzo Ferrari as way to fund his race team, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at $60 a share in 2015. It now trades at $410 a share. The company is valued at more than $75 billion \u2014 roughly 1\u00bd times the market cap of Ford or General Motors, which make millions of cars each year. Ferrari produced only 13,663 cars last year. Ferrari is not a traditional luxury company, of course. It makes cars and has a race team, a merchandise company, a car-restoration company and many businesses that bear little resemblance to a maker of $1,300 scarves and $800 sandals. Yet in a recent research report, Bernstein luxury analyst Luca Solca posits that Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s are similar, since both \"occupy the pinnacle of the pricing pyramid\" in their categories and are \"perfectly positioned\" to benefit from the surge in the global wealthy. To better understand what makes Ferrari a luxury brand, CNBC traveled to Ferrari headquarters in Maranello, Italy, to interview the company's CEO, Benedetto Vigna.\n\nGet Inside Wealth directly to your inbox The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today.\n\nVigna is an unlikely luxury king. He spent most of his career at Geneva-based semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics, where he ran its micro-electromechanical systems and sensors group. He helped create the screen sensor technology used in iPhones, for example. His appointment to the top job at Ferrari in 2021 was a sign that technology would be core to the supercar maker's growth, and in a sense, the future of luxury. In an interview at the company's $200 million E-Building, Vigna talked about the upcoming electric Ferrari, its commitment to sustainability and current global demand for Ferraris. The main topic of conversation, however, was on what makes Ferrari a leader in luxury, and what lessons other companies and executives serving wealthy clients could heed from its rise. Here are five main takeaways:\n\n1. Play hard to get\n\nFerrari Purasangue SUV Adam Jeffery | CNBC\n\nAs Solca points out in his research note, Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s both \"sell less than the market would take.\" A lot less. Based on orders, analysts estimate Ferrari could easily sell two or three times its current production. Ferrari's allure was built on scarcity and exclusivity. Even if you can afford a Ferrari, with an average price of $380,000, securing an order is nearly impossible. The wait time for a Purosangue, Ferrari's pseudo-SUV, and other hot models is now up to three years, the longest in its history. Ask any Ferrari dealer about their biggest problem, and they'll say: \"Not enough cars, too many frustrated clients.\" But CEO Vigna said the scarcity is part of Ferrari's brand promise. \"We have to stay true to our founders strategy, which is to always sell one car less than the market demands.\" His strategy is to grow profit by making more on each car, rather than making more cars. \"We always want to push the quality of revenues over quantity,\" he said. Indeed, Ferrari's production increases over the years have lagged far behind the growth of wealthy potential buyers. In 2010, it produced 6,573 cars, which means over the past 14 years, production has doubled. Over the same period, the global population of billionaires has more than tripled (and so has the population of those worth $30 million+ and $100 million+). Vigna said seeing a Ferrari on the road should be like seeing a rare and exotic animal. The imbalance also gives Ferrari a unique position in the auto world: The cars usually appreciate in value over time. Vigna said that if clients have to wait for one, all the better. \"Waiting is part of the experience,\" he said. During CNBC's visit to the factory, a Ferrari customer took delivery of a new maroon 812 Superfast. He looked to be in his 70s or 80s. When he saw the car, and posed with it under the storied Ferrari entrance gates, his face lit up and he transformed into a 10-year-old on Christmas morning. Ferraris are special, because they are still special.\n\n2. Make emotion the driver\n\nThe Ferrari SP38 seen at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2022 on June 23rd in Chichester, England. Martyn Lucy | Getty Images\n\nAsk any Ferrari fan or owner what makes a Ferrari a Ferrari, and they might say the design, the engine sound, the handling, the power, the braking, or the 100 years of racing history behind that bright yellow badge. Vigna says a true luxury product is defined by one chief characteristic: emotion. \"Ferrari is a luxury company because it's a company that is delivering a unique product. It's connecting with the most inner part of people, the emotional side,\" he said. \"A luxury company is a company that is using technology, innovation, storytelling, heritage, everything, with the ultimate goal to feed that emotional side that we all have.\" Vigna said Ferrari will never produce vehicles that people simply need for transportation. \"When I get invitations to talk to conferences, I won't attend if I hear two words \u2014 utility or mobility. We don't make a useful product. We make an emotional product,\" he told CNBC. It's similar to what LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault refers to as \"desirability.\" It's not enough to make a high-quality product, or an expensive product or one with more features or functions. It has to tug at the heart.\n\n3. The art of pricing\n\nAn in-progress Ferrari at the supercar maker's E-Building in Maranello, Italy. Crystal Lau | CNBC\n\nBased on Ferrari's soaring prices, you'd think pricing is based on profit demands and Wall Street's obsession with margin growth. Yet Vigna said the base price for each model is actually set about a month before its launch \u2013 in an unusual process. \"The way we define price in our company is very simple,\" he said. \"One month before the car is ready for the unveil, we go on the track \u2014 me and several people \u2014 and we drive it for a day or a day and a half. And then with fresh emotion in our body, we define the price. It's me, the CMO and the CFO defining the price. We share the emotion.\" Clearly, those emotions are rising. The cheapest Ferrari in 2012 was the California, with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $195,000. Today's entry-level Ferrari, the Roma, starts at $273,000, or 40% more. Ferrari is launching more limited-edition and special-edition cars that command far higher prices: The SF90 XX Stradale starts at around $900,000, and all 799 coupes and open-top Spiders were sold out when it was unveiled. The SP3 Daytona, with only 599 units, starts at $2.3 million. Perhaps the biggest boost to profits is personalization. Today's Ferrari buyers increasingly want custom paint colors, leather, fabrics, stitching, exposed carbon-fiber and other personal details that make it their own. Those personal touches can add anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 to the sale price. Vigna said his \"value over volume\" strategy means Ferrari can grow profits in the double digits with only modest increases in cars made.\n\n4. The road to VIP status\n\nFerrari would never admit it, but dealers will tell you that customers have to work their way up a costly commercial ladder to get access to new Ferraris and especially limited editions. It's similar to the path Rolex buyers have to follow to eventually get a new Daytona, or Herm\u00e8s customers have to take to eventually get a Birkin. In short, you start by buying a basic (and sometimes less popular) model. Then you can buy a slightly more desirable model, or two or three. If you attend Ferrari events, show support for the brand, even join a Ferrari racing program, you can eventually become eligible for more expensive and even limited-edition models. Nearly three-quarters of all Ferraris are sold to existing customers. Which means starting at the bottom of the ladder is difficult. \"Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s reserve their most desirable products for their most loyal customers,\" Solca said. \"This in effect 'bundles' access and amps up desirability.\"\n\n5. Happy employees means happier customers\n\nWorkers at the new Ferrari NV E-building factory in Maranello, Italy, on Friday, June 21, 2024. The site in Maranello, built over the past couple of years in near-total secrecy, will make Ferrari's first EV from late 2025 alongside hybrid models and cars powered by combustion engines.

        "body": "The drive-thru menu at a McDonald's restaurant showing various meal options and promotions, in Buttonwillow in Kern County, California, on 23, 2024.\n\nSearching for ways to lower labor costs, restaurants are hoping that artificial intelligence can take down drive-thru orders \u2014 but it will likely be years before the technology becomes widely available.\n\nThis year, 16% of restaurant operators plan to invest in artificial intelligence, including voice recognition, according to a survey from the National Restaurant Association. Most of the big spending comes from large chains, which have the capital and scale to make the technology work for their businesses.\n\nEven before the pandemic, labor costs had been rising for restaurants, leading operators to look to technology to boost their profit margins. Then Covid came, which not only accelerated labor costs but also led to a shift away from dining rooms and toward drive-thru lanes. California's decision earlier this year to hike wages for fast-food workers to $20 an hour has only made operators more inclined to embrace technology to cut their labor costs, which has so far helped mostly in the automation of back-of-the-house tasks.\n\nAt the same time, ChatGPT and other AI tools have fueled new excitement for generative AI in restaurants, though the industry is typically slow to embrace technological advances.\n\nOne stumbling block for the burgeoning tech came in June, when McDonald's told its franchisees that it would end its trial of Automated Order Taker, AI technology meant for its drive-thru lanes through a partnership with IBM. Once an early mover in the voice-ordering race, the fast-food giant now plans to turn to other vendors.\n\nThen there's Presto Automation , the AI drive-thru technology company which disclosed last year in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it uses \"human agents\" in places like the Philippines and India to complete orders. Presto interim CEO Gee Lefevre maintains that using humans is common in the AI industry and helps train the technology without straining the restaurant's workforce. The company unveiled a fully autonomous version in May. Still, the initial lack of transparency may scare off some operators.\n\nWhile some restaurants may be skeptical of using AI for drive-thrus now, adoption may increase in the coming months and years.\n\nThe tipping point for voice ordering is likely in 12 to 18 months, according to T.D. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles. That's when he thinks at least two of the nation's top 25 restaurant chains will go all in, expanding their small trial runs of the technology across their footprints.\n\n\"It's like third-party delivery a few years ago: Everyone was testing it, then when McDonald's went with Uber, everyone else followed with their own partnerships,\" Charles said.\n\nThis time, McDonald's likely won't be the first mover.",

        "body": "watch now\n\nIn the wake of 9/11 on an American military base in South Korea, then-Army Staff Sergeant Dave Yeager sat down at a slot machine operated by the Defense Department and made what he now calls the biggest mistake a budding problem gambler can make: He won. \"All that stress, all that tension, all the things that I was carrying with me in that moment went away,\" Yeager told CNBC. What was supposed to be entertainment, a way for servicemembers to relax, instead for Yeager grew into a disorder that would cost him his career, his financial security and his family. \"It went from, I was have fun doing this, to, I have to do this. It became an obsession for me,\" he said. In his book, \"Fall In: A Veteran with a Gambling Addiction,\" Yeager wrote about how he borrowed from subordinates, stole from petty cash and left his family in a lurch financially. Such vulnerability in a servicemember affects individual readiness and potentially even national security, if enemies were to exploit it, he pointed out.\n\nDave Yeager got hooked on slot machines when he was deployed to South Korea. Today, he counsels others about gambling disorder. CNBC\n\nYet, when Yeager said he confessed of that vulnerability to his commanders and his counselors, no one pointed the finger at his gambling, or helped him to help himself. \"The chaplain told me to go to bingo night on Sunday. That would give me something to do,\" Yeager said. \"And I'm like, 'I think you're missing the point here.'\" As of 2017, the Department of Defense operated more than 3,100 slot machines on U.S. military installations in a dozen foreign countries, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. The machines produce more than $100 million annually in revenue and is seen as a morale booster for the welfare and recreation for servicemembers akin to activities like golf, libraries and other entertainment. Overseas, servicemembers as young as 18 may be permitted to gamble. Domestically, slot machines are prohibited on military bases, though casinos are frequently located nearby. There are seven local casinos located within 20 minutes from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, one of the country's largest military installations. In 2018, when a Supreme Court decision paved the way for states to legalize sports betting, the opportunities for wagering exploded. Now, more broadly, all but four states permit gambling in some form. \"All of a sudden, we started to see a lot of people with gambling problems calling and asking for some help, usually within a year or two from the time that it expanded,\" said Heather Chapman, a clinical psychologist and director of the national gambling treatment program for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Diagnoses of pathological gambling disorders among servicemembers and veterans is soaring, with more patients receiving a diagnosis in the first half of 2024 as in all of 2022, according to VA research. Twenty percent of those referrals are women. \"It's not terribly surprising, because with accessibility and availability increases, we tend to see a rise in unhealthy engagement,\" said Dominick DePhilippis, deputy national mental health director for substance abuse disorders for the VA.\n\nServicemembers are more vulnerable than civilians to gambling disorders and may be hesitant to self-report, fearing they could lose their security clearance or to avoid the stigma attached to gambling problems, the VA research found. Studies have found the prevalence of problem gambling and gambling disorder among veterans to be as high as 10.7% in some parts of the U.S., the department said, though those studies have been smaller and typically regional, which leads to a wide variance among results. To address the growing concern, the VA operates two residential treatment facilities for gambling addiction and has a myriad partnerships with civilian facilities throughout the country, Chapman said. \"We are sort of the mecca of gambling treatment,\" she said. The VA began treating gambling disorders in the late 1960s, about nine years after Congress banned slot machines from domestic bases. The Department of Defense declined CNBC's request for an interview, but said in a statement there hasn't been any systemwide increases in resources to address problem gambling. It said a Health Related Behavior survey from 2018 \u2014 before the boom in sports betting \u2014 indicated that rates of problem gambling among servicemembers of 1.6% to 1.7% was in line with the incidence in the civilian population. \"DoD researchers are aware of changes in gambling availability due to new mobile and sports gambling options and will consider these variables in future military gambling research,\" a department spokesperson said in an email. The military is conducting a new survey, with results expected in the fall, the spokesperson added\n\nThe Department of Defense operates slot machines on military bases abroad.

        "title": "Peloton staved off the cash crunch that threatened its business. Where does it go now?",
        "body": "In this article PTON Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Peloton Bike inside a showroom in New York, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2023. Peloton Interactive Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on November 2. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nPeloton no longer faces an imminent liquidity crunch after a massive debt refinancing, but the company still has a long road ahead to fix its business and get back to profitability. In late May, the connected fitness company secured a new $1 billion term loan, raised $350 million in convertible senior notes and received a new $100 million line of credit from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. All of those are due in 2029. The refinance reduced Peloton's debt from about $1.75 billion to around $1.55 billion and pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldn't have had the cash to pay back. Before the refinancing, Peloton would have needed to pay around $800 million toward its debt by November 2025. If it managed to pay that, about another $200 million still would have been due around three months later. The term loan would have been due in May 2027. For Peloton, which hasn't turned a net profit since December 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters, the debt pile posed an existential threat and fueled investor concerns about a possible bankruptcy. Now that it has refinanced, Peloton has eased investor concerns about liquidity and has the breathing room it needs to try to turn around its business. The fact that it was able to secure these loans signals investors believe in its ability to rightsize its business and eventually pay them back, restructuring experts told CNBC. \"This refinancing is now putting us in a much better position for sustainable, profitable growth and just a much stronger financial footing than where we were before, and our investors saw that,\" finance chief Liz Coddington told CNBC in an interview. \"I think they believe in the story. They believe in what we're trying to do, as do we, and in the transformation of the business. And so it was just a great vote of confidence for Peloton's future.\"\n\nPeloton faces risks ahead\n\nWhile the refinance may have bought Peloton some time, it's far from a panacea. Under the terms, Peloton will now be spending about $133 million annually in interest, up from around $89 million previously. It will make Peloton's efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult. Coddington acknowledged to CNBC that the higher interest expense is going to \"impact\" free cash flow, but said that's partly why the company started to cut costs in early May. The plan is expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million. Even with the higher interest payments, Coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business \"materially grow in the near term.\" \"The cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that,\" said Coddington. While Peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy, some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails. Two of Peloton's largest debt holders, Soros Fund Management and Silver Point Capital, are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies. Since the Peloton loans they invested in are secured, they are near the top of the capital structure. If Peloton can't turn its business around and ends up in a position where it's considering or filing for bankruptcy, its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company. \"I would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic,\" said Evan DuFaux, a special situations analyst at CreditSights and an expert in distressed debt. \"I think that's just sort of a smart, opportunistic and kind of tricky move.\" Silver Point declined to comment. Soros didn't return a request for comment.\n\nMore cost cuts to come?\n\nPeloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago, but the company still needs to address the demand issues that have plagued it since the Covid-19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future. \"It really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time, but it doesn't actually fix any of the underlying problems at Peloton,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"Those are very different issues to the refinancing.\" Following former CEO Barry McCarthy's departure and with two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, now in charge, Peloton needs to decide: is it a content company, like the Netflix for fitness, or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment? So far, straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful. \"They're going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable, which parts are not, or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have, especially with the loyal following that they have,\" said Scott Stuart, the CEO of the Turnaround Management Association and an expert in corporate restructurings. \"Money doesn't fix everything, and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance ... the more problematic it becomes,\" he added. Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said Peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on \"bear hugging\" its millions of brand loyalists. He pointed out that the company makes about $1.6 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and sees more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business. \"The problem is, they lose money. How do you lose money if you're generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars?\" said Siegel. \"Well, you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth.\" He said Peloton could generate around $500 million in EBITDA if it cuts research and development, marketing and other corporate expenses. For example, Peloton's marketing budget is around 25% of annual sales, and if the company reduces it to even 10%, it would still be in the \"upper echelon of most brands,\" said Siegel. \"Their debt is scary on a company that's burning cash, their debt's not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of EBITDA,\" he said. \"They have a business that's generating a tremendous amount of cash. They need to stop spending it.\" In May, Peloton announced it would cut 15% of its corporate workforce, but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy. Peloton founder John Foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members, and McCarthy adopted the target when he took over. As of the end of March, Peloton had about 6.6 million members \u2014 woefully behind that long-term target. Since the company announced its cost cutting plan, McCarthy's departure and another disastrous earnings report in early May, Peloton has been largely mum on its strategy. It said that it's searching for a new permanent CEO, and the person it hires will offer clues about the company's direction. If it hires another \"hyper growth tech CEO\" like McCarthy \u2013 who had done stints at Netflix and Spotify \u2013 then Peloton will likely face the same issues, Siegel said. But if it taps someone different, it could signal a strategy shift.\n\nContent magic",

        "body": "Vehicles are offered for sale at a GM dealership in Lincolnwood, Illinois, on June 20, 2024.\n\nDETROIT \u2014 General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.\n\nThe Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIts EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.\n\nSales of GM's full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.\n\nGM's total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.\n\nGM's second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.\n\nAn unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.\n\n\"The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.\n\nGM, in a statement, said its \"dealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.\"\n\nDealers, including the industry's largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.\n\nAll six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six \u2014 Asbury Automotive Group , AutoNation Inc. , Group 1 Automotive Inc. , Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. \u2014 use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.\n\n\"The good news is \u2014 unlike other black swan events that the industry has contended with in the past \u2014 sales shouldn't be lost or severely deferred, but rather pushed into the third quarter,\" Caldwell said.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Toyota reported its second-quarter sales. The company's U.S. sales totaled 621,549 vehicles during the period, up 9.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nThe Hyundai brand sold 214,719 vehicles during the second quarter, up 2.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nKia, which reports sales on a monthly basis, reported a 6.5% decrease in its June sales. Its sales for the first half of the year were down about 2% to 386,460 vehicles sold.",

        "body": "Football fans watch the NFL Super Bowl XLVIII game between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks on at a sports bar in New Jersey on February 2, 2014.\n\nA satellite dish is no longer the only way bars and restaurants can air the National Football League's package of \"Sunday Ticket\" games.\n\nEverPass Media, the joint venture between the league and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners that owns the commercial rights to \"Sunday Ticket,\" acquired UPshow, a platform with the tech capabilities to allow commercial establishments to stream live sports. Terms of the deal were undisclosed.\n\nWith this acquisition, bars, restaurants, casinos and other businesses will be able to stream \"Sunday Ticket\" games. Until recently, they could only do so through a subscription to satellite TV provider DirecTV.\n\nDirecTV will remain as a distributor to bars and restaurants, however. EverPass signed a nonexclusive deal with DirecTV last year to continue to distribute \"Sunday Ticket\" games, giving it the ability to reach deals with other distribution platforms.\n\n\"More content is moving to streaming. Regardless of the streaming economics, it's become pretty clear that live sports is an important piece of that,\" said EverPass CEO Alex Kaplan. \"We're going to think about how to deliver a product and service to our customers that's becoming increasingly more challenging for them to sort of aggregate in a meaningful way. We're still in the early days ... but this is a big step for us.\"\n\nThe new distribution option will be available this coming NFL season.\n\nThe acquisition for EverPass comes as more live sports games are being offered exclusively on streaming services \u2014 a new frontier for business establishments that have long subscribed to traditional pay TV packages to offer live sports.\n\n\"Sunday Ticket\" is an integral sports package for bars and restaurants since it provides all out-of-market NFL games.\n\nIn late 2022, Google' s YouTube TV acquired the residential rights to \"Sunday Ticket\" for roughly $2 billion a year, a deal which runs over seven years. DirecTV had been the owner and exclusive residential and commercial distributor of the games since the package's inception in 1994.\n\nThis followed a deal for Amazon' s Prime Video to become the exclusive home of \"Thursday Night Football\" \u2014 part of the 11-year NFL media rights agreement worth more than $100 billion.\n\nSince then, the media rights owners of NFL games have begun to offer games simultaneously on their streaming services \u2014 and in some cases exclusively. Earlier this year Comcast 's NBCUniversal aired an NFL wild-card game on Peacock, the first time a postseason game was exclusively offered via streaming. Netflix also recently won the rights to air two NFL games on Christmas this year, and at least one on the holiday in the following two years.",

The median price fell 2% to $1.2 million, and prices for luxury apartments fell for the first time in more than a year, according to the report.\n\nThe price declines are a result of rising inventory of apartments for sale, which are also taking longer to sell. There are now more than 8,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan, which is higher than the 10-year average of about 7,000, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, the appraisal and research firm.\n\nManhattan now has a 9.8 month supply of apartments for sale, which means it would take 9.8 months to sell all of the apartments on the market without any new listings, according to Brown Harris Stevens. \"Any number over 6 months tells us there is too much supply and we are in a buyer's market,\" according to the Brown Harris Stevens report.\n\nThe falling prices and rising number of unsold apartments in Manhattan stand in contrast to the national real estate landscape, where continued tight supply continues to keep prices high. Brokers and real estate analysts say the strong prices in Manhattan post-Covid became unsustainable, and both buyers and sellers are finally capitulating to a higher interest rate environment.",

        "body": "Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.\n\nParamount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\n\nOne of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.\n\nParamount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.\n\n\"What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,\" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.\n\nA merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.\n\nWhile a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.\n\nMax has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,\" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. \"Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.",

        "title": "Inside Starbucks' plans to improve stores for customers and baristas",
        "body": "watch now\n\nStarbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' \"Siren Craft System,\" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. \"It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,\" she told CNBC in an interview.\n\nStarbucks Coffee shop in Krakow, Poland on February 29, 2024. Beata Zawrzel | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, \"My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient.\" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.\n\nThe Siren system\n\nStarbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a \"play caller\" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. \"One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,\" Young said. \"We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping.\" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. \"We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,\" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.\n\nStarbucks app expands",

        "body": "In this article SPR\n\nBA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBoeing Co. 737 fuselage sections sit on the assembly floor at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBoeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control. It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \"fully align\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.\n\nMounting pressure",

Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.\n\nThe DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes. The so-called deferred prosecution agreement was set to expire days before the door panel blew out.\n\nBoeing admitted in 2021 that two of its pilots defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration by concealing its addition of a new flight-control system to the planes before they were flown commercially. That system was later implicated in the two crashes.\n\nThe plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers.

A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.\n\nAs a result, before \"Inside Out 2,\" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.\n\nWhile this audience came out in droves for Universal's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's \"The Garfield Movie\" and Paramount's \"IF.\"\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.\n\nAs the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.\n\nNext up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's \"Despicable Me 4,\" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.",

        "body": "Parade participants are seen marching during the 2024 Kentuckiana Pride Parade on June 15, 2024 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen J. Cohen | Getty Images\n\nPride month is winding down \u2014 and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. \"There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'\" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken \"a wait-and-see\" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. \"June this year has not been like the last five or six,\" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. \"The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,\" Ellis said. \"I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing.\" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.\n\nPride Month merchandise is displayed at a Target store on May 31, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe Bud Light and Target effect\n\nConsumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as \"tuck-friendly\" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is \"significantly lower\" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is \"committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round\" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.\n\nA sign disparaging Bud Light beer is seen along a country road on April 21, 2023 in Arco, Idaho. Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Bud Light has faced backlash after the company sponsored two Instagram posts from a transgender woman. Natalie Behring | Getty Images\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. \"You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,\" Reid said.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f.

        "body": "At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.\n\nFor 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.\n\nMost recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver \"The Blind,\" \"The Chosen,\" \"Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist\" and \"Waitress: the Musical\" to audiences. Still to come is \"Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.\"\n\nIn 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.\n\nFathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach \u2014 as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains \u2014 has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.\n\n\"Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.\"\n\nIn post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.\n\nSeason 4 of \"The Chosen,\" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.\n\n\"'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,\" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. \"It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.\"\n\nFathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.\n\n\"We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,\" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. \"These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.\"\n\nThis year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\" as well as the 35th anniversary of \"Steel Magnolias.\" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of \"Blazing Saddles,\" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" the 40th anniversary of \"Neverending Story\" and the 20th anniversary of \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nIt also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" the 35th anniversary of \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and the 30th anniversary of \"Pom Poko.\"\n\nAnd these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.\n\nFathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.\n\n\"Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,\" Bagby said. \"We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.\"\n\n4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.\n\nAudiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"Coraline,\" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.\n\nFathom re-released \"Coraline\" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.\n\nThat $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for \"Coraline\" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.\n\nWhat's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.\n\n\"New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,\" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.\n\nFathom reports presales for this year's screenings of \"Coraline\" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.\n\nBecause Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.\n\n\"[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,\" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. \"They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.\"",

        "title": "Constellation delivers beer profits, but weakness in wine prompts a downgrade",
        "body": "Constellation Brands reported an earnings beat on Wednesday that was driven by strength in its beer business. However, shares fell 4% after an initial move up, as investors \u2014 including us \u2014 remain troubled by continued weakness in the wines and spirits business. Comparable net sales for the three months ended May 31 increased 6% year over year to $2.662 billion, missing Wall Street's expectations of $2.671 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) increased 17% compared with the same period last year, to $3.57, a beat versus the $3.46 per share predicted by analysts. Constellation Brands Why we own it : We like Constellation Brands for its beer franchise, which includes popular Mexican brands Modelo, Corona and Pacifico. We would like Constellation to concentrate on beer and divest its wine and spirits business. Competitors : Anheuser-Busch Inbev and Molson Coors Weight in Club portfolio : 2.5% Most recent buy : April 16, 2024 Initiated: May 5, 2022 Bottom line This quarter reaffirmed our belief that Constellation has a great beer business that is weighed down by its wine-and-spirits unit. While overall sales came up short, CEO Bill Newlands said it still beat the overall consumer packaged goods growth by 4.5 percentage points. That outperformance was largely driven by the growth of its beer business, which attained the second largest share gain in the entire beverage industry and the top share gain in alcoholic beverages. We were again pleased to see that the increase in beer sales was driven by strong growth in shipment volume. Remember, the ability to grow sales via increased volume is crucial given the inflationary dynamics we've had to deal with coming out of Covid. That's because consumers are starting to push back on high prices. The ability to grow sales via increased volumes alleviates some pressure on management to take action on prices, a key factor that should help the company continue gaining market share. Operating cash flow came in light, but free cash flow was largely in line with expectations. As members know, cash flow is the key to shareholder returns and indeed, management paid out $185 million in dividends during the quarter, while repurchasing $200 million worth of shares and repurchased another $40 million worth of shares in June. The team continues to target a net leverage ratio of 3 times by the end of the fiscal year. Management said it is working to right the wine-and-spirits business and expects to see improvements in the back half of the year as \"operational and commercial execution initiatives\" identified in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year and started in the first quarter of this year take hold. Guidance is in line with the expectation that weakness in the business is bottoming out. We maintain the view that a rebound or divestiture of the wine-and-spirits segment remains key to the stock reaching new highs. While we are sticking with the name given the strength in beer, we opted to trim our position and downgrade the stock to a 2 rating. We want to see actual progress before getting more positive on the trajectory of the stock from here. We are keeping our price target of $300. Quarterly results Constellation's wine-and-spirits division remains a drag, with net sales falling 7% to $389 million, slightly below Street estimates, while operating income dropped 25% to around $60 million. Operating margin for the segment was down 370 basis points to 15.3%, worse than expectations. The weakness is attributable to lower volumes and higher costs of goods sold, which more than offset the benefits of lower operating expenses elsewhere. Shipment volumes declined 5.1% due to \"challenging\" market conditions, primarily in the U.S. wholesale channel. Depletions, a key metric that represents how much was product was sold to retailers by a distributor, were down 12.7% from a year ago. \"The tactical investments in the 11 brands that represent 75% of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our wine and spirits business in fiscal '24 are now underway, and we expect to see improvements in this select group of our most scaled offerings over the remainder of the year,\" the company said during its post-earnings call with investors. Beer segment results, on the other hand, remain largely positive. Though sales did come in a bit light versus estimates, the result still amounts to 8% year-over-year growth. Moreover, strong profitability led to a beat on operating income despite the topline miss. Operating margin expansion resulted from greater operating leverage (fixed costs were more spread out), along with benefits from ongoing cost-saving initiatives, and timing and efficiencies in marketing investments. Shipments increased 7.6% year over year. Depletions were up 6.4% versus the year-ago period, led by growth in Modelo Especial (11%), Pacifico (21%), and Modelo Chelada (over 5%). Citing Circana channel data, the company said its beer business was the top dollar sales share gainer for the 11 th consecutive quarter and the top volume share gainer in the total beer category in the U.S. Moreover, Constellations beer portfolio has 4 of the top 15 dollar share-gaining brands in the quarter. Guidance Management reaffirmed the guidance it gave in the previous quarter. Net sales are expected to increase 6% to 7%, driven by 7% to 9% growth in beer. Sales of wine and spirits are pegged at down 0.5% to up 0.5%. Enterprise operating income is expected to increase 10% to 12% on a comparable basis, with beer up 10% to 12% and wine and spirits down 9% to 11%. Management expects comparable earnings to be $13.50 to $13.80 per share. Operating cash flow is forecasted to land between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, with free cash flow of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, after accounting for $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion on capital expenditures, with $1.2 billion of that targeted to support capacity additions to its Mexican beer operations.

        "body": "With signs building that the labor market is at least slowing if not something worse, the June nonfarm payrolls report takes on added significance.\n\nPayroll gains so far in 2024 have totaled 1.24 million, down about 50,000 a month below the same period a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report, to be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, to show growth of 200,000, down from the 272,000 reported for May.\n\nIn historical terms, the pace of job gains is still solid. But there are signs bubbling underneath that conditions could be getting softer and possibly pointing at broader economic weakness down the road.\n\n\"This is a report that's coming at a point where there's a little more uncertainty about the economic landscape than there has been in a few months,\" said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \"Specifically, I'm thinking more about the unemployment rate, which has been slowly trending up.\"\n\nThe jobless level in May did nudge higher to 4%, the first time it hit that threshold since January 2022, up from 3.7% a year ago. The forecast is for the rate to hold there.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a 4% unemployment rate would be cause for celebration, not concern. However, what is catching the eye of some economists is where the rate is now compared with where it's been over the past year.\n\nThe May rate was 0.5 percentage point above its 12-month low of 3.5% in July 2023, potentially triggering a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule. The rule has shown consistently that whenever the unemployment rate on a three-month average eclipses its 12-month low by half a percentage point, the economy is in recession.",

        "body": "Private payroll growth edged lower in June, according to a report Wednesday from ADP that indicates a potential slowdown in the U.S. labor market.\n\nCompanies added 150,000 jobs for the month, below the upwardly revised 157,000 in May and the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 160,000. The total was the lowest monthly gain since January.\n\nWithout the surge in leisure and hospitality hiring, the total would have been considerably lower. The sector added 63,000 jobs, easily the biggest gain among the categories that payrolls processing firm ADP measures.\n\nOther sectors showing gains included construction (27,000), professional and business services (25,000), other services (16,000), and trade, transportation and utilities (15,000).\n\nOn the downside, natural resources and mining showed a decline of 8,000, manufacturing lost 5,000, and information was off 3,000.\n\n\"Job growth has been solid, but not broad-based,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \"Had it not been for a rebound in hiring in leisure and hospitality, June would have been a downbeat month.\"\n\nThe pace of wage gains also moved lower for those who stayed in their jobs, down to 4.9% on a year-over-year basis for the smallest rise since August 2021. Job switchers saw a 7.7% increase, a number that also has been trending lower.\n\nThe bulk of job creation came from companies that employ 50-499 workers, a group that added 88,000 on the month. Small businesses contributed just 5,000. Geographically, 80,000 jobs came from the South, or more than half the total.\n\nADP's report serves as a precursor to the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count that the Labor Department will release Friday. That report is expected to show an addition of 200,000 jobs, following May's 272,000.\n\nThe two reports often differ, sometimes substantially, with ADP consistently undershooting the Bureau of Labor Statistics count. For May, the BLS reported that private payrolls rose by 229,000, or 72,000 more than ADP's estimate.",

        "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell announces that interest rates will remain unchanged during a news conference at the Federal Reserves\u2019 William McChesney Martin building on June 12, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed satisfaction Tuesday with the progress on inflation over the past year but said he wants to see more before being confident enough to start cutting interest rates.\n\n\"We've made quite a bit of progress and in bringing inflation back down to our target,\" Powell said at a central banking forum in Sintra, Portugal.\n\n\"The last [inflation] reading and the one before it to a lesser extent, suggest that we are getting back on the disinflationary path. We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy,\" he added.\n\nPowell spoke at a forum that also included European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Brazil central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto. The forum was presented by the ECB and the discussion was moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen.\n\nThe comments come with markets closely watching moves from the Fed and its global counterparts as inflation shows signs of easing and some central banks, including the ECB, have slowly started rolling back interest rates.\n\nThe Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed focuses on as its main inflation gauge, rose at a 2.6% 12-month pace in May. That level has come down steadily after being around 4% a year ago, though policymakers do not expect it to reach the Fed's 2% goal until 2026.\n\nWhile Powell said he sees progress on inflation, he's wary of moving too soon and threatening the downward path of price increases, which hit their highest pace since the early 1980s two years ago.\n\n\"We're well aware that if we go too soon, that we can undo the good work we've done,\" he said. \"If we do it too late, we could unnecessarily undermine the recovery and the expansion.\"\n\nRisks of moving too late as opposed to too soon have come into better balance this year as inflation has ebbed and the economy and labor market have stayed strong, Powell added. By contrast, the Fed spent much of the past year worried that cutting rates too soon and allowing inflation to resume its upward trek posed the greater risk.\n\nEarlier this year, markets had expected at least six Fed rate cuts of a quarter percentage point each. Market pricing has since adjusted to anticipate two reductions, one in September and another before the end of the year. However, members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at their June meeting penciled in just one.\n\nAsked if he thought the Fed might cut in September, Powell responded, \"I'm not going to be landing on any specific dates here today.\"\n\nHe also was asked about whether he was concerned about the political climate and specifically should Donald Trump, a fierce Powell critic, win the November presidential election.\n\n\"I am not focused on that at all, and that's not just a talking point. I really think that we just keep doing our jobs,\" he said.",

        "body": "A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.\n\nDividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.\n\nInvestors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.\n\nHere are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nDarden Restaurants\n\nThe first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.\n\nDarden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nFollowing the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.\n\nSaleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.\n\n\"We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,\" said Saleh.\n\nSaleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)\n\nInternational Seaways\n\nNext up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.\n\nIn its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.\n\nFollowing meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.\n\nAccordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.\n\nNolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). \"We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,\" said the analyst.\n\nNolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)\n\nCitigroup\n\nFinally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.\n\nThe bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.\n\nFollowing the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.\n\nRamsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.\n\n\"The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,\" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.\n\nRamsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%. (See Citigroup Technical Analysis on TipRanks)",

The movie is directed by Jenkins and the screenplay is a collaboration between \u201cThe Chosen\u201d showrunner, Platte F. Clark, Darin McDaniel, and Ryan Swanson.\n\nIn an interview with Deseret News, Jenkins described the creation of the holiday movie as \u201ca dream come true,\u201d calling the project \u201cthe movie I\u2019ve most wanted to make my whole career.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t want to do it with anyone other than Lionsgate and Kingdom, who make great movies while supporting filmmakers,\u201d he said.\n\nJenkins once described \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d as \u201cthe movie that I was born to make,\u201d adding, \u201cIf I could only make one more movie for the rest of my life, this is it.\u201d\n\nThe book \u2014 and the upcoming movie \u2014 chronicles the lives of the Herdman children.

Ultimately, though, the misfit kids make the program better than anything they\u2019d seen before.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe story, Jenkins explained in an Instagram post, is \u2014 at its core \u2014 a story about \u201cthe least of these.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to what \u2018The Chosen\u2019 is trying to do, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to take the story of Christmas and story of Jesus and taking down from stained glass windows and pretty paintings \u2026 and revealing what it actually is. And through the eyes of these kids, they actually do that.\u201d\n\nHe sees the upcoming debut as his shot at making \u201ca new Christmas classic.\u201d\n\nThe film stars Lauren Graham of \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d fame, Judy Greer from Marvel Cinematic Universe films like \u201cAnt-Man,\u201d comedian Pete Holmes, and \u201cThe Chosen\u201d star Elizabeth Tabish.",

        "body": "It\u2019s tempting to look at the so-called \u201cGreat Abstaining,\u201d as The Cut put it, and think it\u2019s a notch on the belt of those preaching biblical morality in a culture run amok.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, unfortunately.\n\nI think what we\u2019re seeing now \u2014 this growing (and, on its face, encouraging) trend toward sexual abstinence \u2014 is just the flip side of the same counterfeit coin: the siren sound of the world, of our own fractured morality. It\u2019s the same voice that has told us: \u201cSex is just sex.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in casual hookups.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem if it\u2019s consensual, with or without marriage?\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nNow, apparently, many are choosing to abstain from sex (ironically) for what I believe to be the very same reasons they opted to have sex indiscriminately.\n\nScripture urges abstinence outside of marriage because God calls us to keep the marriage bed \u201cundefiled\u201d (Hebrews 13:4-6). In the beginning, God made clear His design is for man and woman to join together in marriage and become \u201cone flesh\u201d (Genesis 2:24). Those principles \u2014 the spiritual bond solidified by the act of sex \u2014 reverberate throughout the biblical narrative. The Apostle Paul urged believers to practice lordship over their bodies and fleshly desires, even going so far as to write that, to the man who has sex with a prostitute, with her he has become \u201cone body\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:12-20).\n\nSex is a gift from God intended to bring about a beautiful spiritual oneness expressed in the physical world.\n\nSo what\u2019s the issue, then, with this burgeoning \u201cGreat Abstaining?\u201d Well, it\u2019s rooted not in recognition of just how important and sacred sex is. Rather, it\u2019s just the opposite; it seems tethered to the errant belief that there is no real value in sex and its ultimate, tangible purpose \u2014 procreation.\n\nPeople are choosing to opt out of sex because they are rejecting the value of relationship, of romance, and, finally, of marriage.\n\nRather than finding satisfaction in husband-and-wife relationships, younger Americans are choosing themselves over sacrificial love. The Cut\u2019s Kelsey Osgood wrote the next generation is \u201cdeemphasizing traditional romance.\u201d They aren\u2019t just choosing to shun marriage; many are actively arguing it\u2019s no longer valuable.\n\nAs for sexuality, they are opting to gratify their own urges in the same hedonistic way our broken world has always encouraged, just with a new spin. This is entirely unsurprising, given our culture\u2019s years-long celebration of so-called \u201cself-love.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe benefits from a period of celibacy are endless because, ultimately, it\u2019s about self-development,\u201d The Independent reported last year.\n\nThe societal shift toward abstinence isn\u2019t moral; it\u2019s egotistical.\n\nPorn use, for example, is soaring. For context, see this from Psychology Today:\n\nXvideos, the top-ranked pornography site, had 700,000,000 more total visits than Amazon and 900,000,000, 1,100,000,000, 1,300,000,000, 1,500,000,000, and 1,800,000,000 more total visits than TikTok, OpenAI, LinkedIn, Netflix, and The Weather Channel, respectively.\n\nThen there are those who see abstinence as just the next wave of \u201csexual liberation,\u201d another irony.\n\nModels like Julia Fox are choosing to forgo sex as a way of \u201cprotesting\u201d the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court, she seemed to argue recently, has \u2014 in her view \u2014 taken away her rights to abortion as birth control, so now she\u2019s going to abstain from sex altogether because it could lead to pregnancy. (Shouldn\u2019t that have been a consideration all along? But I digress.)\n\n\u201cI felt like, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, if they were gonna take away our rights to our body and our reproductive rights, well, then, this is my way of taking them back,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel like more women should really get on that, because we hold the power.\u201d\n\nAll of this to say: this is so often how Satan and our own deceitful hearts work. They take a modicum of truth \u2014 that abstinence is a good thing \u2014 and twist the motives in a sinful direction.\n\nIf there is a silver lining here \u2014 and I believe there\u2019s always a Gospel opportunity in every cultural conversation \u2014 it\u2019s that such a trend could pave the way for fruitful conversations about why, in actuality, abstinence is good, why God designed sexual expression to be enjoyed within certain parameters, and how sex is a gift that should be celebrated and is profoundly redemptive when enjoyed within God\u2019s boundaries, rather than destructive.",

        "body": "A new wave of prescription drugs is breaking ground by helping patients drop unwanted pounds, address Type-2 diabetes, reduce the risk of deadly heart problems, and possibly even help battle alcoholism.\n\nA small study of only six people who screened positive for alcohol use disorder showed a significant decrease in symptoms while using semaglutide, the active ingredient in the popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. The study will likely lead to a larger, more reliable one.\n\nDoctors view Ozempic and Wegovy, as well as similar drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, as game changers. Studies show these drugs can help users lose an average of between five and twenty percent of their body weight, even if patients have tried unsuccessfully to lose weight in the past.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\nAll four drugs target the body's hormones to increase the feeling of fullness, decrease hunger, and slow the gastrointestinal (G.I.) tract. They're FDA-approved to treat Type-2 diabetes, obesity, or both. The company Novo Nordisk makes Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, which targets one hormone.\n\nThe drug company Eli Lilly manufactures Mounjaro and Zepbound, which contain the active ingredient tirzepatide, which targets two hormones. Research suggests Mounjaro and Zepbound lead to slightly more dramatic weight loss.\n\nAll four drugs are administered through weekly injections in the abdomen by the patients themselves. Many users pay over $1,000 a month out of pocket for the treatments. Despite the cost, high demand is leading to shortages of the medications.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is there's a lot of factors that go into the conditions of obesity and overweight. It's a complex, chronic condition. It's not as simple as eating less and moving more. So they do have a major role,\" obesity medicine expert Dr. Jen Ashton told ABC News, \"But insurance does not oftentimes cover them, they're incredibly expensive, and they have to be managed by someone who's familiar with this class of medications.\"\n\nLike all medications, these carry some possible side effects. The most common ones are nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain.\n\nResearch shows Ozempic and Wegovy lower the risk of death from heart attack or stroke by 20 percent after three years.\n\nDr. Daniel Skovronsy, president of Eli Lilly research labs, said his company is encouraging insurance companies and employers to cover the medications so more customers can avoid paying out of pocket for them.

        "title": "End Times and Israel: 'God's Covenant With the Jewish People' and Evangelical Support Amid Gaza War",
        "body": "Evangelical support for Israel has remained unchanged amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a recent survey. Researchers found the belief that \u201cGod\u2019s covenant with the Jewish people remains intact today\u201d serves as the greatest impact on support for the Jewish state.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d:\n\n\u201cIf a respondent professes this belief, the likelihood that this person strongly supports Israel increases almost threefold (180%),\u201d reads a press release from researchers behind the study.\n\nDr. Motti Inbari, a professor of Jewish studies at UNC Pembroke, and Dr. Kirill Bumin, associate dean of Metropolitan College and director of Boston University Summer Term Programs, explained to CBN News what they found most stunning about the latest data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this research for quite some time,\u201d Bumin said. \u201cAnd one of the things that I find particularly interesting is the degree to which the attitudes that we see in the Christian community are crystallized or rigid.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe have seen relatively little change in attitudes towards support for Israel, support for Palestinians, or support for neither from 2021 onward.\u201d\n\nBumin said this persists even after the Oct. 7 attack and subsequent war broke out.\n\nAnother factor of interest was generational differences the researchers observed among young evangelicals, who have been found to be less supportive \u2014 particularly those under the age of 20 \u2014 of Israel.\n\n\u201c[This is the case] even after we take into account their religious attendance, their specific religious beliefs, political beliefs, socialization in pro-Israel circles,\u201d Bumin said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something very distinct about the under-30 crowd, especially in comparison to the 50 to 64-year-old respondents who are even more supportive of Israel than the 65-plus crowd.\u201d\n\nInbari said the younger generation has more access to information on social media and other platforms \u2014 tools older generations aren\u2019t as accustomed to. He said these platforms, by design, create an echo chamber dynamic as people are primarily served only the content they want to see and hear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in \u2026 your own mindset [and] you\u2019re not exposed to other views,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this creates a lot of polarization also as a result. \u2026 Another aspect is that it\u2019s very visual. You can see things that, back when I was younger, in that age, when I was opening the newspaper, I was reading. Now, they see. They don\u2019t read; they see. It creates a different effect.\u201d\n\nAs for evangelical support more generally, Bumin said an embrace of the biblical narrative, particularly the Abrahamic covenant, is \u201cexceptionally important\u201d to explain why evangelicals have such a positive view of Israel.\n\n\u201cSupport for Abrahamic covenant \u2014 this notion that God\u2019s covenant with the Jewish people is intact and eternal and that, as a result of Gentiles supporting Abrahamic covenant, that there are blessings for the Gentiles to be had \u2026 that aspect has repeatedly received support, not only in the evangelical community, but indeed across all Christian denominations \u2026 that we have studied,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, in our 2024 survey, that is the No. 1 most impactful variable that we\u2019ve considered in terms of relative impact on people\u2019s attitudes \u2026 in terms of support for Israel.\u201d\n\nThe theological elements don\u2019t end there, though, as Bumin also cited evangelicals\u2019 views on the end times, particularly premillennialism. According to GotQuestions.org, premillennialism is the \u201cview that Christ\u2019s second coming will occur prior to His millennial kingdom, and that the millennial kingdom is a literal 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth.\u201d\n\nBumin said premillennialism offers a \u201cvery clear-cut picture\u201d of the role of the Jewish people and Israel in the end of days, with Jerusalem taking center stage. This theological construct, he said, helps consistently affirm support for Israel, especially in this context.\n\n\u201cWe also find for evangelicals again and again that ascribing to a particular theology or theological view related to end times known as premillennialism has been really important,\u201d Bumin continued. \u201cThere are a lot of different elements to these millennial views. There\u2019s a premillennialism, post-millennialism, amillennialism, but the most important aspect in terms of these views for us is the relationship to the Jewish people and Israel in the end times.\u201d\n\nInbari noted that younger evangelicals are much less inclined to take a premillennial view, showcasing how this might impact the aforementioned decreased support they show for the Jewish state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another way to explain why young evangelicals are drifting away from supporting Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the eschatological view that is part of that mix as well.\u201d\n\nInbari and Bumin also spoke about the current war in Gaza and its relation to views on Israel and Palestine.

The seeds were planted more than a hundred years before in the soil of the New World. One of the most important was in what would become Connecticut.\n\nA vast wilderness awaited the hundred, hardy Christians who left Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1636 with the Rev. Thomas Hooker to settle what is now Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nIn such a wild land, they asked the popular pastor how they should govern it. What Rev. Hooker preached on May 31st, 1638 was so profound it \"sowed the seeds of free Constitutional government in America.\" That's what it says at the base of a statue of Hooker that stands in Hartford to commemorate the man who helped form a free nation.\n\n'Free Consent of the People'\n\nThe key words in that sermon were '\"the foundation of authority is laid, firstly, in the free consent of the people.\"\n\nIn other words, not that a king or emperor should rule them, but the people themselves should be the rulers.\n\nHis pushing this idea is why some historians have labeled Hooker \"the father of American democracy.\"\n\nHooker's fellow pioneers ran with the idea of \"the free consent of the people,\" according to William Federer, author of the historical series \"American Minute,\" which can be found at www.AmericanMinute.com\n\n\n\n\"This was revolutionary and it turned into the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut which is considered the first written constitution in modern times,\" Federer told CBN News.\n\nThis insistence on the people having \"free consent\" is a part of what drove Hooker and his fellow settlers to get out of the Puritan Cambridge.\n\nRadio talk show host Michael Medved explained, \"It's precisely what led Thomas Hooker to found Connecticut. To leave Massachusetts. He was having an argument with other pastors. He didn't see it the way they did. It's John Cotton versus Thomas Hooker. And part of what it has to do with is suffrage, is the ability of people to vote and to make their own decisions.\"\n\nThere's another statue in Hartford of a pioneer family with their heads bowed, the father kneeling, in prayer. A plaque behind them says \"here they established the form of government upon which the present U.S. Constitution is modeled.\"\n\n\"Which starts off how?\" Federer asked. He answered: \"'We the People.'\"\n\nRadical Idea in a World of Kings & Potentates\n\nThe historian pointed out how radical this was after 6,000 years of almost nothing but rule by kings and emperors, pharaohs, and potentates.\n\n\"And they believed in a top-down form of government, where God gives all the power and the rights to the king and he's God's lieutenant who dispenses it to the people,\" Federer said.\n\nColonialists like Hooker turned that on its head.\n\nFederer \u2013 who authored Who is the King in America? -- explained, \"America's founders when they got the chance, they wanted to run away from a king, and they flipped it and made the people the king.\"\n\nMedved summed up their bedrock belief: \"All of us have the same ultimate Sovereign, God Almighty. But that God Almighty does not appoint and designate crowned heads over us. The power comes from the people.\"\n\nFederer recalled, \"John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said 'the people are the sovereign of this country.'\"\n\nAnd they practice that sovereignty as they all head to the polls to pick their representatives in government.\n\nHooker is just one of many preachers who pushed the colonies toward liberty and rule by the people. Many historians suggest in their earliest days, preachers were often the most influential thought leaders in the colonies.\n\nFearing 'Establishment of Religion'\n\nIn fact, religion was such a powerful force that most colonies named the most powerful denomination in a particular colony the official church there. That's \"establishment of religion.\"\n\n\"All of these colonies were deeply religious. All of them. And all of them deeply Christian,\" Medved said. \"But they were Christian in distinctive ways. And the different Christian denominations, then as now, distrusted each other. The Puritans in Massachusetts and Connecticut did not like the Anglicans in North Carolina and Virginia. And then you had Quakers who nobody liked who were in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nMedved explained as the colonies were forming the newly independent nation of America, they were concerned about how this establishment of religion could actually dampen some of that freedom.\n\nFor instance, Medved pointed out, \"Virginia was the most powerful colony. It was the most populous and the most powerful. And people were very afraid that Virginia would use that power to establish the Anglican Church.\"\n\nThey didn't want to go from being ruled over by a king they didn't respect to being dictated to by a denomination they didn't even belong to.\n\nAs Federer put it, \"They didn't want a federal Walmart to come into town and put out of business their local mom-and-pop denomination.\"\n\nMedved asked, \"What do you do when you have these different states, different requirements, different religions? You make a First Amendment which says 'Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion.'\"\n\nHe argued, though, that in no way suggested they wanted to be free of religion or God. In fact, they openly praised Him and gave Him credit for His hand in they're becoming a free nation.\n\nAmerican Experiment = American Miracle\n\n\"The one idea that seemed to unite all the founders was the idea of Providence,\" Medved stated, \"The idea that they were doing God's work; that this American experiment was ultimately an American miracle.\"\n\nWhich just happens to be the name of Medved's new book: The American Miracle: Divine Providence in the Rise of the Republic.\n\nStill, all these preachers and founding fathers did have a model for another time when God freed a people from rule by an all-powerful potentate and showed them the concept of liberty and how to rule themselves, guided by His hand.\n\n\"When Moses took the children of Israel out of Egypt, that was the first instance in world history of an entire nation with no king,\" Federer pointed out.\n\nHebrew Republic Inspired Them\n\nPilgrims and Puritans crushed under European kings studied this ancient \"Hebrew republic\" and took the dream to emulate it with them as they fled to North America.\n\nOne thing after another was revolutionary in this Hebrew Republic, such as the tribes electing their own leaders. And that all people were to be treated as equals.\n\n\"Israel was the beginning of the concept of equality on planet Earth,\" Federer said.\n\nIt was also the first nation where everyone was taught to read, so they all could be taught the law. And each had a hand in enforcing it and maintaining it, along with the nation itself. So they didn't need a standing army, which in many nations becomes a tool in the hands of a power-hungry ruler.\n\n\"You have a king, he has an army to enforce his will,\" Federer explained. \"In Israel, every man was in the militia and armed and ready at a moment's notice to defend his family and his community.\"\n\nHe added, \"Israel had no police. Not only did everyone get taught the law, everyone was responsible to help enforce the law.\"\n\nFinding Freedom in the God of Liberty\n\nBut what was to keep all this freedom from spiraling down into anarchy?\n\nFederer explained, \"Ancient Israel had the key ingredient: a God who was watching everyone, He wants you to be fair, and He's going to hold you accountable in the future.\"\n\n\"If everybody in the country believes this, you can maintain complete order with no police. Maximum liberty!\" Federer declared.\n\nThe founding fathers believed fervently that God made mankind to be free and wanted them to have this sort of maximum liberty.\n\nFederer concluded, \"That allowed America to blossom into this amazing experiment of the people getting to be king. And each individual citizen accountable to God.\"\n\n*First published June 30, 2017",

        "body": "A Tennessee judge has ruled against releasing the journals written by the shooter who killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville in March of last year.\n\nParents of the victims asked the judge not to release the killer's manifesto.\n\nChancery Court Judge I\u2019Ashea Myles made the ruling on July 4, declaring that The Covenant School children and parents hold the copyright to any writings or other works created by shooter Audrey Hale, a former student and transgender who was killed by police. Hale's parents inherited the works and then transferred ownership to the families.\n\nMyles said \u201cthe original writings, journals, art, photos and videos created by Hale\u201d are subject to an exception to the Tennessee Public Records Act created by the federal Copyright Act.\n\nThe ruling comes more than a year after several groups filed public records requests for documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the March 2023 shooting, wanting to expose the motivation behind the attack.\n\nThe group of Covenant parents opposed to the writings being released were allowed to intervene in the case and argued that the records should never become public. They said the release would be traumatic for the families and could inspire copycat attacks.\n\nAs part of the effort to keep the records closed, Hale's parents transferred ownership of Hale's property to the parents' group. Attorneys for the parents then argued they owned the copyright, further reason the records could not be released.\n\nBrent Leatherwood, an attorney for families of the victims, and father of students who attend Covenant, shared reaction to the judge's ruling Friday morning.\n\nHere Are Their Responses:\n\nThe Family of Hallie Scruggs - \"Far too often in our time, cruelty prevails over kindness; evil prevails over justice. Today was not one of those days. Instead, our hope is that the pain and suffering we have endured over the last year won't continue forward to terrorize other families and other communities. Though we still grieve, we are thankful for this result.\"\n\nThe Family of Mike Hill - \"Our dad found such joy each day at school with those children. He loved serving them and he was always there to protect them. While we still feel the pain of his loss in our lives, this decision helps continue his legacy as our family, Covenant children, and other communities will be more protected because these ramblings will not be able to inspire future attacks from other individuals who are consumed by hate and perceived grievances.\"\n\nThe Family of Cindy Peak - \"The last year and a half without Cindy has been difficult. But today brings a measure of relief in our family. Denying the shooter some of the notoriety she sought by releasing her vile and unfiltered thoughts on the world is a result everyone should be thankful for. I only wish that others, whether seeking clicks or profit, had felt that way before revealing the depth of depravity that existed in the mind of a mass murderer on March 27.\"\n\nDr. Erin Kinney, Mother of Will Kinney - \"This opinion is an important first step to making sure the killer can't hurt our babies anymore. The importance is even more clear due to the leaking of stolen police documents, which has violated our parental right to protect our traumatized and grieving children from material that could destroy their lives. We are more resolved than ever to fight to keep our children and everyone's children safe from this murderer.\"\n\nThe Family of Katherine Koonce - \"The Court's finding vindicates our family's desire that public focus should be on the nobility of the loved ones who died tragically, and on the gracious support extended to households who suffered loss and trauma.\"\n\nThe Family of Evelyn Dieckhaus - \"No result will lessen the pain we carry each day. But this decision will ensure no additional burden is added to our family, and that has been a major objective for us. No one should have to live through the nightmare of losing a child to such senseless acts, and our hope is that by keeping the rest of this material from seeing the light of day, it will ensure no other family has to walk this path.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Hurricane Beryl Strikes Mexico\u2019s Coast as a Cat 2 Storm, Could Reemerge to Hit Texas",
        "body": "TULUM, Mexico (AP) - Hurricane Beryl made landfall on Mexico\u2019s coast near the resort of Tulum as a Category 2 storm early Friday, whipping trees and knocking out power as it came ashore after leaving a trail of destruction across the eastern Caribbean.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said that Beryl is expected to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses over the Yucatan Peninsula before it re-emerges into the Gulf of Mexico and likely regains hurricane strength.\n\nOnce in the warm waters of the Gulf, Beryl is forecast to head toward northern Mexico near the Texas border, an area had already been soaked by Tropical Storm Alberto just a couple of weeks ago.\n\nOnce the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl spread destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Barbados in recent days.\n\nShortly after landfall, Beryl\u2019s maximum windspeeds had decreased to 100 mph (160 kph), according to the U.S. Hurricane Center.\n\nMexican authorities had moved some tourists and residents out, of low-lying areas around the Yucatan peninsula prior to landfall, but tens of thousands remained to tough out the 100 mph (160 kph) winds and expected storm surge. Much of the area around Tulum is just a few yards (meters) above sea level.\n\nThe city was plunged into darkness when the storm knocked out power as it came ashore. Screeching winds set off car alarms across the town.\n\nOnce a sleepy, laid-back village, in recent years Tulum has boomed with unrestrained development and now has about 50,000 permanent inhabitants and at least as many tourists on an average day. The resort now has its own international airport.\n\nEarly Friday, the storm\u2019s center was about 15 miles (25 kilometers) north-northwest of Tulum and was moving west-northwest at 15 mph (about 24 kph), the hurricane center said.\n\nOn Friday, Beryl was expected to weaken as it crossed over the Yucatan peninsula and re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico, where the surprisingly resilient storm could once again become a hurricane and make a second landfall around Mexico's border with Texas next week.\n\nAuthorities around the Yucatan peninsula have prepared shelters, evacuated some small outlying coastal communities and even moved sea turtle eggs off beaches threatened by storm surge. In Tulum, authorities shut things down and evacuated beachside hotels.\n\nTourists were also taking precautions. Lara Marsters, 54, a therapist visiting Tulum from Boise, Idaho, said \u201cthis morning we woke up and just filled all of our empty water bottles with water from the tap and put it in the freezer \u2026 so we will have water to flush the toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect that the power will go out,\u201d Marsters said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hunker down and stay safe.\u201d\n\nBut once Beryl re-emerges into the Gulf of Mexico a day later, forecasters say it is again expected to build to hurricane strength and could hit right around the Mexico-U.S. border, at Matamoros. That area was already soaked in June by Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez said temporary storm shelters were in place at schools and hotels but efforts to evacuate a few highly exposed villages - like Punta Allen, which sits on a narrow spit of land south of Tulum - and Mahahual, further south - had been only partially successful.\n\nEarlier, Beryl wreaked havoc in the Caribbean. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 95% of homes on a pair of islands in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, jumbled fishing boats in Barbados and ripped off roofs and knocked out electricity in Jamaica.\n\nOn Union Island, part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a man who identified himself as Captain Baga described the storm's impact, including how he had filled two 2,000-gallon rubber water tanks in preparation.\n\n\u201cI strapped them down securely on six sides; and I watched the wind lift those tanks and take them away -- filled with water,\" he said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a sailor and I never believed wind could do what I saw it do, if anyone (had) ever told me wind could do that, I would have told them they lie!\u201d\n\nThe island was littered with debris from homes that looked like they had exploded.\n\nGirlyn Williams and Jeremiah Forde were trying to recover what they could Thursday around their home, where only a concrete foundation remained standing.\n\nThey had run from room to room during the storm as different sections of their house were being destroyed. Eventually, they hid in a small space created by a rubber water tank that got wedged between the house and a concrete tank.

        "body": "The Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah launched a massive barrage of nearly 200 rockets, missiles, and drones on Thursday at northern Israel, including the Golan Heights and close to the Sea of Galilee.\n\nHezbollah claimed it was in retaliation for Israel\u2019s assassination of Mohammed Khaasab, whom they gave the title of honorary commander. Though he was killed in Lebanon, Hezbollah said he was martyred on the \u201croad to Jerusalem,\u201d a signal that the group\u2019s ultimate goal is to conquer Jerusalem.\n\n\"The series of responses is ongoing and will continue, targeting new sites the enemy never imagined would be hit,\" said the head of Hezbollah\u2019s Executive Council, Hashem Safieddine.\n\nThe ongoing assault could lead Israel to launch an all-out war on Hezbollah to enable 80,000 evacuated Israelis back into their homes in the north.\n\n\"We know there is still a long way to go, but we are determined to restore security to the north and return the residents safely to their homes,\u201d stated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHezbollah Threatening More Attacks\n\nAs war inches closer, both Hezbollah and its patron Iran are threatening to obliterate Israel. Netanyahu issued a strong response, \u201cWe established a principle, whoever harms us is marked for death. We put it into practice.\"\n\nHamas has made some amendments to a proposed ceasefire deal that could free many of the hostages now captive in Gaza. The changes were enough for Israel to send a negotiating team to renewed ceasefire talks, but there are conflicting reports on whether Hamas is ready to agree to a deal without a permanent end to the fighting and the removal of all Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nThose are both dealbreakers according to Netanyahu.\n\nNYT Claims Some IDF Generals Ready to Give Up in Gaza\n\nAccording to a New York Times report that cited unnamed sources, some top IDF generals are ready to give up the war on Hamas if it means the hostages will finally be set free.\n\nNetanyahu is blasting the report, \u201cI don\u2019t know who those unnamed parties are, but I\u2019m here to make it unequivocally clear: it won\u2019t happen.\"\n\nNetanyahu reiterated his government\u2019s war goals are to return all the hostages, eliminate Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, and ensure that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel.\n\nAs for the ongoing conflict in Gaza, one of Israel's most powerful enemies, Turkey, says the Jewish nation must be forced to end the war that has laid waste to much of Gaza.\n\nHezbollah, Iran & Israel Trade Death Threats\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, \"To end this destruction (in Gaza) Israel must be stopped and forced to accept a permanent ceasefire.\"\n\nTo that end, several Arab nations are seeking to isolate Israel by moving to freeze its participation in the United Nations.\n\nThe Palestinian Permanent Representative to the Arab League, Muhannad al-Aklouk stated, \"A step like this step is what ended, brought down, and eliminated the colonial regime in South Africa.\"\n\nOn July 4th, Netanyahu sent Independence Day greetings and a message to the U.S.:\n\n\"At their base, Israel and America are guided by the same twin insights. Freedom is the most precious gift humanity will ever know, and freedom isn't free. You have to be willing to fight for it.\"",

        "title": "'The Culper Ring': What George Washington's Spies Can Still Teach Us Today",
        "body": "NEWS ANALYSIS\n\nIn 1783, the American Revolutionary War ended. The 13 former British colonies, now the new United States of America, had won their independence \u2013 the freedom we cherish today \u2013 from the British king and his oppressive government.\n\nAmong the many thousands of American heroes who fought in the long seven-year war, there was one small group of men and women who history forgot.\n\nWhy? Because they wanted it that way.\n\nThe group was known as the \"Culper Spy Ring.\" It was a network of spies for General George Washington that successfully operated in and around New York City for five years without ever being discovered by the British.\n\nThe members of the ring knew the price they would pay if they were caught. Washington's first attempt at placing a spy on Long Island had cost Captain Nathan Hale his life. A graduate of Yale University, Hale was a schoolteacher. He had no training as a spy but volunteered anyway. Hale's mission to supply critical information to his commanding general failed. Within two weeks of volunteering for the assignment, he was dead, hanged by the British as a spy. Hale's body was left hanging for several days as a warning to other would-be informants. He was later buried in an unmarked grave.\n\n\n\n\"George Washington\" by Weidenbach, Augustus. (Image courtesy Library of Congress)\n\nHale's death touched Washington on many levels. He realized that more than just one man was needed to collect the military information he desperately sought. What he needed was a network of spies.\n\nIn November of 1778, Washington assigned Major Benjamin Tallmadge as his director of military intelligence. He had found his spymaster. But who were Tallmadge's informants? They were carefully selected from the friends the major had made while going to school on Long Island. The ring included Austin Roe, Caleb Brewster, Abraham Woodhull, James Rivington, and Anna Strong.\n\nThough Woodhull was Tallmadge's chief agent (code name Samuel Culper), Robert Townsend (codename Samuel Culper Jr.) was an important source who posed as a Loyalist coffee shop owner and merchant while working as a journalist. In his guise as a reporter, Townsend was able to obtain information from the British at social gatherings, according to Mount Vernon's website.\n\nThe Culper Ring successfully supplied information about British military strength and even possible plans to attack Washington's Continental Army.\n\nThe ring was also directly responsible for the arrest of Major John Andre, the British spy who had been plotting the takeover of the fort at West Point with his accomplice American General Benedict Arnold, the fort's commandant. Plans of the fort were found in Andre's boots when he was captured by members of the New York militia.\n\nBeing a good spymaster, Tallmadge kept the identities of his spies a closely guarded secret. After all, one loose lip, one slip of the tongue by anyone, could and would cost them their lives, and possibly even the lives of their families.\n\nAccording to MountVernon.org, the major developed a way to identify his spies with pseudonyms and invented a numerical substitution system to identify his informants rather than use names. Seven hundred and sixty-three numbers were used, with 711 denoting General Washington, 745 representing England, and 727 for New York. Tallmadge and his associates also wrote their messages using invisible ink.\n\n\n\nPortrait Miniature of Benjamin Tallmadge (1754-1835). (Image courtesy: Collection of the Litchfield Historical Society, Litchfield, Connecticut)\n\nThe identities of the Culper Ring were such a closely guarded secret that even Washington didn't know who they really were. As Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaegar noted in their New York Times best-selling book George Washington's Secret Six: The Spy Ring That Saved the American Revolution, \"several members of the ring (Townsend in particular) had been insistent that Washington never learn their names.\"\n\nEven after the war was over, the members of the ring kept their identities a secret. In April of 1790, Washington visited Long Island, including Setauket, where the ring had operated. The once-commanding general and now President of the United States reportedly visited with several members of the ring during his visit, but whether he knew who they really were, he did not say.\n\nOne member of the ring Washington personally wanted to thank was Townsend, who had risked his life almost every day for his country. But according to Kilmeade and Yaegar, \"Townsend never stepped out of the shadows to reveal himself to his commander-in-chief. It was a great honor to be sure, but not one that Townsend sought. He did not want praise or celebration; the greatest reward Washington could give him was simply a return to a quiet and unassuming life as a man subject to no king but God.\"\n\nTallmadge and the members of the Culper Ring took their secret to their graves. The public wasn't aware of the spy ring's existence until the 1930s. Townsend's identity as \"Samuel Culper Jr.\" was discovered in 1929 after a historian was going through Townsend's old correspondence. Rivington was confirmed as being one of Tallmadge's spies in the 1950s.\n\nEven today, there's still one spy who has yet to be identified \u2013 Agent 355. Some historians theorize 355 may have been a woman.\n\nOver the years, there have been numerous monuments and statues erected to Nathan Hale's sacrifice across the country. High schools, middle schools, elementary schools, university buildings, dormitories, a Revolutionary War fort, a U.S. Army installation in Germany, a U.S. Navy submarine, and even a town in New York bears his name. Hale was officially designated Connecticut\u2019s state hero in 1985.\n\nYet, there are no statues to be found of any members of the Culper Spy Ring. All of them deserve to stand alongside the many other heroes of the American Revolution. Under the direction of Tallmadge, the Culper Spy Ring risked everything to serve their new country in a war that had been deemed unwinnable by much of the world. After all, they were up against the British Army, one of the mightiest militaries on the planet at the time.\n\nAs Kilmeade and Yaegar wrote, \"They never sought credit, never received accolades, and never revealed the risks they took or the sacrifices they made to serve our country.\"\n\n\"The observation of (British) Major George Beckwith bears repeating: 'Washington did not really outfight the British, he simply outspied us!'\" the authors noted.\n\nSo what's the lesson Washington's spies can still teach us? The lesson of humility.\n\nThey protected one another by not revealing any of their wartime experiences, good or bad. They kept each other's secrets to themselves for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn this social media-driven \"Look at Me \u2013 Tell All\" culture that we live in today, it is a lesson from which we can all learn, and perhaps that in itself is their best epitaph.\n\n**Originally published July 4, 2021.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "'Our Flag Was Still There': The True Story of the Family That Saved the Star Spangled Banner\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 As we celebrate our country's independence and freedom, there's perhaps no greater symbol than the American flag, often called the Star Spangled Banner. Today, the original flag, which served as the inspiration for Francis Scott Key and the National Anthem, sits in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. and how it got there is an interesting story.\n\nAuthor Tom McMillan details that story in his new book, Our Flag Was Still There: The Star Spangled Banner That Survived the British and 200 years \u2013 and the Armistead Family Who Saved It.\n\n\"The song, written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, was inspired by the flag that flew at the Battle of Baltimore at Ft. McHenry,\" said McMillan in an interview with CBN News. \"After all of the fighting, Key saw it still proudly waving in the wind.\"\n\nMcMillan explained how the song is about Key figuring out who had won the battle.\n\n\"Through the mist he sees our flag,\" he added. \"Our flag was still there. There are four verses to that song and it's kind of sequential.\"\n\nAfter the battle, Commander George Armistead took the flag home as a souvenir.\n\n\"A complete violation of Army regulations,\" said McMillan. \"He stole the flag but it remained in the private possession of his family for 90 years. And no one really knew about it. That's why it exists today. His grandson gave it to the Smithsonian in the early 1900s.\"\n\nMcMillan's research even led him directly to some of Commander Armistead's descendants.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n\n\n\"I was, fortunately, able to track down some direct descendants of George Armistead,\" said McMillan. \"When you're an author you just write them cold letters. You don't know if they're ever going to respond. Fortunately, I've had pretty good success and one called me, one whose name was George Armistead \u2013 called me right away. It's a little strange when you're researching George Armistead from 1814 to get a phone call from George Armistead.\"\n\nThe family invited McMillan into their Philadelphia home and what he found there went way beyond the flag.\n\n\"I went to the bathroom in their home and I came down their stairs and I saw some things on the wall where you hang high school diplomas and things like that. And these items were signed by John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison,\" McMillan recalled. \"They were George Armistead's original army commissions. And I said, 'You can't have these in your house!'\"\n\nThey also had an original portrait of the Commander. McMillan was able to connect them with the Smithsonian where they've since donated many of these national treasures.\n\nMcMillan says he loved digging into the research for this book.\n\n\"I think to do it you have to love the research just as much as the writing,\" he explained. \"Writing is fun, but it's learning. If you weren't curious like sometimes people will come up \u2013 this is my fourth book \u2013 'why don't you write about this, why don't you write about that.' You have to love it. You can't just get an assignment.\"\n\nFor him, this was no \"assignment.\"\n\nBefore writing this book, he served as Vice President of Communications for the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\n\"I had a great career,\" he said. \"I was in the media before that but I always said that, you know, for a lot of people sports is their escape from their job so when you work in sports you need an escape from it so history was my 'sports.'\"\n\nHe says his hope for this book is that it deepens readers' appreciation for history \u2013 and our country.\n\n\"One of the curators said when we were working on it the last time that they viewed it as a metaphor for the country,\" he said. \"It's tattered, it's torn but it still survives and the flag survives if the country survives.\"",

        "body": "'The Dam Clearly Has Started to Break': Several Dems Tell Biden to Drop Out as Trump Rises in Polls\n\nPresident Biden's political future remains uncertain in the wake of his shocking debate performance during which he appeared confused and stiff, often unable to communicate effectively. While calls for the president to bow out of the 2024 election from members of his own party increase, others, including Biden himself, say he's staying in and will win reelection.\n\nWednesday evening, 22 Democrat governors met with Biden at the White House to discuss his future.\n\nAfter the meeting, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore told reporters the governors were concerned about Biden's mental health.\n\n\"When you love someone you tell them the truth,\" he said. \"I think that we came in and we were honest about the feedback that we were getting. We were honest about the concerns that we were hearing from people.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden listens during a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House, July 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said when Biden told the group he wants to stay in the race, they vowed to help him get reelected.\n\n\"President Joe Biden is in it to win it,\" she said. \"All of us said we pledged our support to him because the stakes could not be higher.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, during an all-staff campaign call, the president said he has no plans to drop out of the race, while the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated that message to reporters.\n\n\"The President is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race,\" she said.\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden spoke to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to assure them he plans to continue his race and capture the White House.\n\n\"He has done this outreach, he's having these conversations,\" she said. \"It is important to him to do so.\"\n\nHowever, Biden reportedly told at least two people in private that he's \"keeping an open mind\" about his path forward, and that his upcoming public appearances are critical to determining whether he'll remain in the race.\n\nCBN Political Analyst David Brody said it will be difficult for Biden to ease concerns about his mental health because his condition is likely to only get worse.\n\n\"The problem for Joe Biden here is that Democrats want to see him perform at a top level. And the reality is he's not at a top level,\" Brody said. \"That means he's going to have to be error-free in the next few weeks, let alone the rest of the campaign. And that's going to be a really hard climb for Joe Biden at this point.\"\n\nTexas Rep. Lloyd Doggett became the first congressional Democrat to publicly call for Biden's withdrawal, followed by Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva, possibly signaling the beginning of the end.\n\n\"I think what's happening now is that we're moving from the, 'Will he resign?' stage to the, 'When will he resign?' stage,\" Brody said. \"I think it's just a matter of time. At this point, the dam clearly has started to break. We've seen some elected congressmen, Democrat Congressmen, come out and say, 'No more, Joe.' I think that number will grow.\"\n\nA new poll from The New York Times and Siena College taken after Biden's dismal debate performance shows 74 percent of Americans believe he is too old for the job.\n\nThe gap between him and former President Trump has widened to six points, with Trump ahead 49 to 43 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, polls show Vice President Kamala Harris scoring two points higher against Trump, but still losing.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***",

        "body": "The words of the Declaration of Independence reach across time to speak to the hearts of Americans even after nearly 250 years. Here's the entire declaration that led to America's freedom:\n\nWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shewn that mankind is more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses:\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions, We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which the Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\n\nNew Hampshire:\n\nJosiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton\n\nMassachusetts:\n\nJohn Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry\n\nRhode Island:\n\nStephen Hopkins, William Ellery\n\nConnecticut:\n\nRoger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott\n\nNew York:\n\nWilliam Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris\n\nNew Jersey:\n\nRichard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark\n\nPennsylvania:\n\nRobert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, George Ross\n\nDelaware:\n\nCaesar Rodney, George Read, Thomas McKean\n\nMaryland:\n\nSamuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Charles Carroll of Carrollton\n\nVirginia:\n\nGeorge Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, Carter Braxton\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nWilliam Hooper, Joseph Hewes, John Penn\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nEdward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr., Arthur Middleton\n\nGeorgia:\n\nButton Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "China's increasing worldwide influence is a major debate in this presidential election year. It centers on whether the Chinese Communist Party is viewed as a friendly competitor or an enemy of the United States.\n\nRecently, investigative journalist and author Peter Schweizer detailed China's efforts to undermine America from within.\n\nSchweizer contends Communist China is at war with America, sowing chaos and death without firing a shot. He makes that argument in the book Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans.\n\n\"China has a strategy, they call it disintegration warfare that says, look, we don't want to have a kinetic fighting war with the United States because that would lead to all kinds of disruption and damage in China,\" Schweizer explained. \"So, we're going to try to beat them by not going to war, but by undermining them nonetheless.\"\n\nSchweizer believes that the Chinese Communist Party undermines America by employing the tactics of Sun Tzu, a fifth-century Chinese military strategist who argued that an enemy can be defeated without actual combat.\n\n\"They're doing this by sowing social chaos in the United States,\" Schweizer warned. \"They're literally killing Americans with fentanyl. All the Mexican cartels are the junior partners. This is a Chinese operation.\"\n\nLATEST: Unprecedented Discovery at Southern US Border Exposes Chinese Criminal Alliance with Sinaloa Cartel\n\nSchweizer claims to have found links between the Biden family and the head of a Chinese gang involved in Mexican fentanyl distribution, Zhang Anle, also known as \"White Wolf.\"\n\n\"White Wolf has a business partner who gave the Bidens in 2017 a $5 million forgivable loan that the Bidens have never repaid,\" Schweizer insisted. \"So, you literally have one degree of separation between the first family of the United States and this poisonous fentanyl trade.\"\n\nSchweizer believes that explains why President Biden has not been more aggressive in confronting China on the fentanyl issue.\n\n\"We need to remember that the bribery and corruption statutes in the United States say even if the actual politician doesn't get a dime, if his family member profits, that in and of itself is corruption,\" Schweizer said.\n\nAs fentanyl continued to pour across the U.S. southern border, the Centers for Disease Control released an alarming statistic: over 112,000 Americans lost their lives due to fentanyl overdose in 2023.\n\nSchweizer alleged it isn't only the Biden family that China is influencing. He believes China has financial ties with members of both major political parties in the United States, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Schweizer alleges that the family of McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, owns a shipping company called Foremost Shipping, which has grown and expanded due to its Chinese business connections.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\n\"If Mitch McConnell as a senator were to do or say something that particularly angered Beijing, they could destroy the family shipping business overnight,\" explained Schweizer. \"That's the kind of leverage they have and the kind of leverage that they use.\"\n\nAccording to Schweizer, the most surprising discovery in his book is the involvement of two Chinese billionaires in inciting division and chaos in American culture.\n\nHe argues that Roy Singham, the founder of Thoughtworks, and Joe Sy, the co-founder of Alibaba, have invested millions of dollars in radical cultural causes such as the transgender movement. Alibaba is a Chinese e-commerce company similar to Amazon.\n\n\"But unlike Amazon in the United States, this is a business that's closely wedded to the Chinese government,\" Schweizer explained. \"What's troubling about these actions is not only their support of the cause, but the fact that they don't actually advocate for these causes in China itself, which leads me to believe that they see it more as a disruptive force in American society than something that they actually embrace as a belief system.\"\n\nWhat can be done? Schweizer believes the country must first deal with Chinese political influence in Washington. After that, Americans need to be aware of what is going on. He said that if people stay informed and are equipped, they can win this war for American hearts and minds.\n\nMORE:",

        "body": "America's 'Explicit Covenant with God': How a Nation Pledged to God Can Save a World or Lose It\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Covenants are viewed as the most sacred and binding of deals \u2013 an oath that's never to be broken. America's earliest settlers made a covenant with God to serve and proclaim Him throughout the earth. These days, however, Americans appear to have forgotten this covenant and that can have dire consequences.\n\nChristian leader Dutch Sheets explained to CBN News how God's relationship with us is set by a sacred covenant.\n\nThis author of Giants Will Fall said, \"It's even what He based our salvation on: 'I'm coming to bring a new covenant through Jesus. The shedding of His blood ratifies this covenant.' It is a binding together that in Him is unbreakable.\"\n\nAmerica Began in Covenant\n\nEarly English settlers also wanted their new land to share such a binding covenant with God. Christian historian Eddie Hyatt, the author of The Great Prayer Awakening of 1857-58, said those who came to Jamestown starting in 1607 put it in their Virginia Compact.\n\n\"To propagate, to expand the gospel, the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to take the gospel to people who were 'lying in darkness and had no knowledge of the one true God.' They said that was the reason they had come,\" Hyatt stated.\n\nThe Pilgrims arriving in Massachusetts stated the same in 1620. Jerry Newcombe, the author of The Book That Made America, paraphrased what they wrote down: \"'Having undertaken a voyage for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith.'\"\n\nNewcombe explained of the Pilgrims and Puritans who followed, \"They came for God as opposed to coming for gold.\"\n\nHyatt says John Winthrop, leading 700 Puritans to Massachusetts in 1631, said it like this: \"'Others may come to the New World for wealth and furs.' He said, 'We have another goal, another end. We have entered into an explicit covenant with God to be His people in this New World.' And they wanted to be that city on a hill. They wanted to be a model of Christianity for the rest of the world to see.\"\n\nDavid Barton of Wallbuilders said as these early settlers wrote out their covenants, \"They were very cognizant of the fact that we answer to God. We need to get God at the center of what we do. If we do, He'll bless us. If we don't, we're in trouble.\"\n\nThese Covenants Became Models for the US Constitution\n\nThese early covenants pledged the signers to each other and to obeying the laws they'd form with God's guidance.\n\nAs Newcombe put it, \"This was something that would bind each man and each person to the whole community as an agreement under God.\"\n\nAccording to historian William Federer, such compacts became the model for the US Constitution, whose authors were also very much guided by their Christian faith.\n\nThe writer of the online AmericanMinute.com stated, \"George Washington at the beginning of the Constitutional Convention, he said 'the event is in the hand of God.'\"\n\nHow Has America's Constitution Lasted So Long?\n\n\"They saw the Constitution as being a very religiously-based document,\" said Barton. \"It was also a very covenantal-based document. We made a covenant. The Constitution is a covenant of these states.\"\n\nHe went on, \"The average length of a constitution in the history of the world was 17 years. So how have we gone 230 when everybody else was going 17? And so political science professors looked to see where the Founders got their ideas.\"\n\nBarton pointed out they studied 3,154 direct quotes from these Founders' political writings and discovered how much God's Word figured in them.\n\nHe summed up, \"The number one source was the Bible: 34 percent of all those quotes in those political documents, etc., came out of the Bible.\"\n\nSheets explains in his book Giants Will Fall that the makeup of the government was shaped by biblical passages like Isaiah 33:22, writing, \"Our nation's form of government was actually taken from scripture. 'The Lord is our Judge {Judicial Branch}\u2026Lawgiver {Legislative Branch}\u2026and King {Executive Branch}.'\"\n\nThe Founders put God first and foremost in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFederer stated, \"It says right in there 'appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world.' In this founding document, we appealed to God. We invited Him to be a part of this American experiment.\"\n\nThe Founders put Scripture on the Liberty Bell, Leviticus 25:10: \"Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof\u2026\"\n\nThe concept of this being one nation UNDER God harkens back to Jesus telling Jerusalem in Luke 13:34 that He wanted to \"\u2026hide you UNDER my wings, covering and protecting you.\"\n\nDire Consequences of Deserting Covenant\n\nWhat happens though, as parts of the nation don't want to be under God, disregard parts of the Constitution, and no longer honor sacred oaths?\n\nSheets warned, \"We have walked away from covenant with Him.\"\n\nAnd even from the marriage covenant, with the divorce rate soaring 302 percent in the 20th century.\n\nNewcombe argued, \"A lot of the things that we're experiencing in America today are because we've disregarded God's covenant.\"\n\nAmerica, once the number one exporter of the Gospel, is now the number one importer of illegal drugs and the number one exporter of pornography.\n\nNewcombe explained God warned about this, saying, \"'Obey me then I will bless you. But if you disobey me, I will remove my blessing.'\"\n\nSo Much Is on the Line\n\nIf America really is to be the place from which the Gospel is spread to the whole world, then the salvation of billions hangs in the balance.\n\nSheets believes there's hope, but only if Americans return to honoring their covenant with God, because that makes us His family.\n\nSheets gave an example, saying, \"If the kids across the street I don't know, if they do something evil or wrong, I feel no responsibility to try to bring them back into the fold, because I'm not in covenant with them. I'm not in that relationship. God is the same way.\"\n\nBarton pointed out the long-suffering faithfulness of the Lord, saying, \"We're told in Psalm 105 He keeps His covenant for a thousand generations.\"\n\nSheets added, \"I don't think there's a stronger force in the world.\"\n\nSo there's a chance the nation can still someday completely fulfill the prophecy of destiny Jamestown chaplain Robert Hunt said in 1607 as he came ashore in Virginia, just a few miles from where the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s headquarters are located.\n\nHyatt explained, \"He made this declaration which I believe was prophetic. He said, 'From these very shores the Gospel shall go forth, not only to this New World but to all the world.' And that was just not very far from CBN!\"\n\nIt just takes getting back to covenant. As Joel 2:13 says, \"Now return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in loving-kindness.\"",

        "body": "Mike Huckabee has worn many hats in the public square. He was once the governor of Arkansas, a Republican presidential candidate \u2014 and a pastor.\n\nToday, he\u2019s a commentator and TV host, sharing his perspective on the news and political happenings of the day.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe preacher-turned-politico, who has a new daily TBN show, \u201cHuckabee Today,\u201d recently told CBN News he believes the state of American politics today is more polarized than he\u2019s ever seen it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it quite so filled with rancor and contentiousness, but part of that is because people feel very passionately about their beliefs, their country,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cAnd we have a divided country \u2026 what we have is a divide between those who want to lean towards socialism, where the government gets stronger and bigger \u2014 where many people think the government is god.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAnd then there are still many of us who believe that the government is at best a tool of God, but it needs to be in the hands of people of integrity, people who will use it fairly and justly, but it should never become our god.\u201d\n\nHuckabee said people must remember the importance of freedom \u2014 both \u201cindividually and corporately\u201d \u2014 as a centerpiece of America.\n\nOne of the big changes Huckabee has noticed is a political drift within the parties. He said both Democrats and Republicans were once not too far apart and could find common ground.\n\nToday, he believes the dynamic is quite different.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a time now where it\u2019s hard to find common ground with people who believe that we\u2019re an evil country \u2026 who believe that America was built on stealing land from people to whom it belonged and therefore we should give it back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have that much of a fundamental difference, it\u2019s really hard to find common ground and find that sort of center of governing.\u201d\n\nHuckabee also shared his biggest fears about what might unfold policy-wise in November if former President Donald Trump isn\u2019t the victor.\n\n\u201cIf he does not win \u2026 I think what we\u2019re going to see is an accelerated effort on the part of the government to go after those of us that have been the targets already,\u201d he said, noting examples of parents being painted in a negative light for speaking out about objectionable content. \u201cIf [a] mother is labeled [a] domestic terrorist because she spoke up at a school board meeting and that\u2019s already happening, what happens in the next four years when a government thinks that it now has an unbridled right to go after all of its political enemies?\u201d\n\nHuckabee expressed concerns that people will be prosecuted and pursued, using Trump\u2019s legal woes as an example of what he says could happen to others.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in the next four years, I think, is disturbing,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe courtroom then becomes the new public forum, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to find increasing numbers of pro-life people, Christian people, pro-Israel people, pro-freedom people finding themselves taken in chains \u2014 and when I say that \u2026 I don\u2019t mean it figuratively.\u201d\n\nWatch what Huckabee had to say here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The Founders Meant to Keep Government Out of the Church, Not God Out of the Government\n\nThe 4th of July makes us think of our independence and freedoms. And recent legal battles over religious liberty in the U.S.A. raise serious questions about the freedom to worship in America. So when our Founders came up with the First Amendment, were they trying to keep the government free from religion, or religion free from government?\n\nThese days, the phrase \"wall of separation between church and state\" has come to mean keeping God or His believers from having a big effect on government and public life. But that\u2019s far, far from what the Founding Fathers were thinking of when they were separating church and state.\n\nFear of an All-Powerful State Church Wed to the Power of the Government\n\nThey were afraid of what so many of the Old World countries had: a religion established by the state as its one true religion, that would tyrannically rule over the faith and conscience of every citizen.\n\nAs the Providence Forum\u2019s Peter Lillback put it, \u201cThey recognized having a monolithic church was a dangerous thing.\u201d That's because it made the king not only their physical sovereign but also their all-powerful spiritual ruler.\n\nBefore the Pilgrims fled England, Wallbuilders' David Barton recalled, \u201cThe Pilgrims\u2019 pastor was executed because he made the statement that Jesus Christ is head of the church. And the monarch said, \u2018oh no, I\u2019m the head of the church. You\u2019re dead.\u2019\u201d\n\nWouldn't Allow a Church of America Like the Brits Had the Church of England\n\nKnowing of such terror and tyranny, AmericanMinute.com historian William Federer explained how the Founders felt: \"Their big fear was the federal government was going to follow the blueprint of every country in Europe and pick one national denomination.\"\n\nSo what they meant by saying in the First Amendment \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" was that the federal government was banned from creating \u2013 or \"establishing\" \u2013 a national religion with the national government wedded to it.\n\n\"They didn't want to have a national, established Church of America like you have the Church of England, forcing people to believe something that they didn't believe in,\" said Jerry Newcombe, host of the radio program \"Vocal Point\".\n\n\u201cWhat they said was, 'We don't want a state church here. Consciously, therefore, they were separating the church from government,\" Lillback said.\n\nBut that was strictly to protect the churches and each believer\u2019s faith and conscience from the government.\n\nAll About Protecting Each American's Conscience and Freedom to Believe\n\nNot only did the First Amendment say, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" but it also said, \"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\n\"What they wanted was the freedom that we have in the Bible: the rights of conscience,\" Barton said. \"And they didn't want the state telling us how we could or couldn't practice our faith.\"\n\nLillback said the Founders keeping government control away from faith meant, \"Each of us has a right to be who we are before God. It has been well said and it's a classic statement of religious liberty that man is not free unless he is free on the inside. We have to have the freedom to believe what we believe. That's what the First Amendment protects.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n'God: He's on Both Sides of the Wall'\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Christian historian Eddie Hyatt explained Thomas Jefferson was talking about when he wrote the letter that first used the famous \"wall of separation\" phrase to a group of worried Baptists.\n\n\"He said that the First Amendment had erected a wall of separation that would protect them from any intrusion of the government,\" Hyatt stated. \"In Jefferson's mind, the wall of separation was a uni-directional wall, put there to keep the government out of the church; not to keep the influence of the church out of the government.\"\n\nThere was no antipathy towards the Lord in all of this, Lillback insisted, saying, \u201cBut the idea of God: He\u2019s on both sides of the wall. And He\u2019s welcome there. And He should be.\u201d\n\nThe Government Is Reaching Over that Wall, Bossing Around People of Faith\n\nBut today, there's been a complete flip.\n\nLillback said, \u201cThose who once believed in this really high and impregnable wall of church and state, we now see the government reaching over that wall and saying, \u2018but don\u2019t preach that text of scripture.\u2019\u201d\n\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE CBN NEWS APP\n\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Top Stories\n\nBarton added, \u201cAll of a sudden the government\u2019s regulating religious activities, which is what Jefferson said they would not do because of separation of church and state.\u201d\n\nHyatt lamented, \u201cThe Founders would be so distressed to see how that statement has been turned on its head.\u201d\n\nAs Newcombe explained, \"They absolutely did not mean the separation of God and government, which is what's often being practiced today.\"\n\nNo One 'Under Government,' but Each One 'Under God'\n\nLillback encourages Americans to remember what the nation's Founders intended.\n\n\u201cThis is a theistic government. So God was not separated from government,\" he insisted. \"So any interpretation of the First Amendment that takes God out of government is turning the whole story on its head. Rather it was taking a formal state church out of the equation, leaving it up to each individual. But all, as we still say, 'under God.' That was the view of our Founders.\"\n\nThey believed a nation based on liberty could only stay free if its citizens were godly people. As Barton pointed out, believers in God have their eyes on eternity, and it makes them practice self-control.\n\nKnowing You'll Answer to God Makes You Govern Yourself\n\n\"When you\u2019re God-conscious, you realize, \u2018ya know, I\u2019m going to have to answer to Him for what I do,\u2019 and it limits my bad behavior,\" Barton stated.\n\nNewcombe added, \u201cThat\u2019s something the Founders believed very strongly: that we\u2019re going to be accountable before God.\u201d\n\nHyatt said of those Founders, \"They knew that they were creating a nation for a free people, but also for a virtuous people who would govern themselves from within.\"\n\nYou need very little police power if people, because of conscience, will police themselves.\n\nGreen Bean Control Laws?\n\n\"Self-control is what you need,\" Barton explained. \"We can pass all the control laws we want. But unless you control the heart, you'll never control behavior. I mean, I can kill somebody with a can of green beans. What are we going to do? Pass green bean control laws if somebody does that? No. It's on the inside.\"\n\nAnd the Founders knew to keep America true and free, they also needed the perfect law of a loving, all-wise God.\n\nAs Lillback put it, \u201cThere was a clear understanding that the government needed to have an ultimate check and balance, even beyond the people that ran it and their elections. And that is the transcendent law of God. And so that is why when we look at our Declaration of Independence, there are four references to Deity.\u201d\n\nGoing through the Declaration, Lillback laid them out: \"'We're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' The laws of God and nature. And it tells us there's an appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world. And, finally, a dependence on the Providence of God. Four references to Deity.\"\n\nNot Godless at All\n\nBut then came the US Constitution, which some say is a godless document because God isn\u2019t mentioned in it. As soon as they were done with it, though, the Founders called for a day of Thanksgiving to God.\n\n\"They were not thinking 'let's get rid of God',\" Lillback stated. \"They said 'We have been given now a new Constitution, and now amendments that give us our freedoms. And where do we turn? We turn to heaven and thank God for this'.\"\n\n\"Now, if their intent was to get rid of God from government, boy did they miss their point,\" Lillback said. \"Because they turned around and thanked Him for everything that they had. It shows the utter historical absurdity of 'the godless Constitution'.\"\n\nConstitution's Last Words Reference Christ\n\nAnd God isn\u2019t really absent from the Constitution or its authors\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThey are not godless,\" Lillback insisted. \"They are people who at the very end of their work said \u2018In the year of our Lord, 1787.\u2019 The very last words in the Constitution are a reference to Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise then that the ultimate motto is We are One Nation Under God.\u201d\n\n*This story was originally published in July 2020.",

        "body": "Hurricane Beryl Roars Toward Jamaica after Killing at Least 6 People in Southeast Caribbean\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) - Hurricane Beryl was roaring toward Jamaica on Wednesday, with islanders scrambling to make preparations after the powerful Category 4 storm earlier killed at least six people and caused significant damage in the southeast Caribbean.\n\nIn Kingston, people boarded up windows, fishermen pulled their boats out of the water before sitting around a table to play dominoes beside a bay, and workers dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from the expected lashing winds to come.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan\u2019s east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. Early Wednesday, the storm was about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph), the center said.\n\nBeryl was expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica, where officials warned residents in flood-prone areas to prepare for evacuation.\n\n\u201cI am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat,\u201d Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a public address Tuesday. \u201cIt is, however, not a time to panic.\u201d\n\nIn Miami, U.S. National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said Jamaica appears to be in the direct path of Beryl. He urged residents to find a safe place to shelter and stay there through Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are most concerned about Jamaica, where we are expecting the core of a major hurricane to pass near or over the island,\u201d he said in an online briefing.\n\nStorm surge of 6-9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above typical tide levels are likely in Jamaica, as well as heavy rainfall.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in place for the entire southern coast of Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press. She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.\n\nGrenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \u201cremains a grim reality.\u201d\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed, and that \u201csimilar levels of devastation\u201d were expected on the islands of Myreau and Canouan.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nGrenada, known as the \u201cspice isle,\u201d is one of the world's top exporters of nutmeg. Mitchell noted that the bulk of the spices are grown in the northern part of the island, which was hit hardest by Beryl.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

        "body": "Recent events in the Middle East are causing additional hardship and suffering for Christians in Yemen.\n\nFor years, the tiny group of believers there have withstood intense persecution from militant Muslims and their government. Now, the attacks on ships and other actions of Houthi rebels are making matters worse.\n\nThe Houthi movement began about thirty years ago as an insurgency against the Sunni Muslim government. Armed by Iran, the Shia Muslim militia is crucial to Tehran's strategy to dominate the Middle East and control shipping lanes by restricting access to the Red Sea.\n\nREAD Houthi Strike Brings Death at Sea\n\nDuring recent testimony before Congress, former CIA intelligence analyst and Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute Dr. Kenneth Pollack said the Houthis share Iran's goal of destroying Israel and driving the United States and its allies out of the Middle East.\n\n\"The Houthis have proven themselves to be belligerent, aggressive, and convinced that violence is the best way to get what they want,\" Pollack insisted. \"They are forces of oppression inside Yemen and forces of aggression beyond it.\"\n\nYemen's small but growing community of Christians is among those targeted by the Houthis.\n\n\"The Christians in this area are folks that were formerly Muslim \u2013Muslim background believers that have converted to Christianity. Christians are obviously a despised, minority,\" explained Open Doors U.S. CEO Ryan Brown.\n\nBrown's group lists Yemen as the world's fifth worst persecutor of Christians on its 2024 World Watch list.\n\nHe said years of war had left the people largely dependent upon outside aid. So, when shipping lanes are disrupted, food and other necessities are slow to reach Middle Eastern ports, driving up costs, and Christians \u2013 those refusing to wage jihad or engage in Islamic practices are marginalized.\n\n\"Christians are often last in line as it relates to being able to receive the care and attention there as war and as these things continue to escalate. That has a ripple effect and economic ripple effect. It can disrupt supply chains, and so, while Christians were already last line, that line becomes even further elongated,\" explained Brown. \"And so Christians are very much impacted by what's going on currently.\"\n\nOnce they leave Islam and are baptized, Yemeni Christians are considered apostates by Muslims. So, they keep their new faith secret to avoid severe persecution and possibly death at the hands of their clan or family members.\n\nAnd if they are not killed for their faith, they are often blamed for their connections to the West.\n\n\"They become easy targets,\" said Brown. \"You know, there is Al-Qaeda presence in the South, Houthi presence in the North, and Christians are seen as enemies on all fronts there.\"\n\nBrown said although many Yemenis are frightened, they are also curious and asking questions about faith. Followers of Jesus respond with the Word of God.\n\nHe advises the body of Christ to pray for their Yemeni brothers and sisters in Christ, \"That even in the midst of this conflict, that they would see peace and they would see security, but they would recognize that in the midst of this conflict, God is doing incredible things, that his purposes are advancing, and the church is advancing there.\"",

        "body": "Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), responsible for Israel\u2019s forests, held a tree planting ceremony in memory of Druze soldiers who have given their lives in the current Iron Swords War.\n\n\"The Druze community's journey of mourning since the beginning of the war is a journey of mourning for the entire nation,\u201d Shaykh Mowafaq Tarif, the Spiritual Leader of the Druze Community in Israel said at the ceremony.\n\nYet, thanks to this journey, we can maintain normalcy in the country. KKL-JNF's initiative is a touching and significant gesture \u2013 planting trees in memory of the fallen here in the Galilee, where the roots of the Druze community have been planted for nearly a thousand years,\u201d Shaykh Tarif added.\n\nThere are about 143,000 Druze citizens living in northern Israel, including the Golan Heights. The men are all required to join the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), at about age 18, like Israeli Jewish men.\n\nNine Druze soldiers are among the more than 670 Israeli soldiers that have fallen in battle since the October 7th war, dubbed Iron Swords, began.\n\n\u201cThe Druze community has walked hand in hand with KKL-JNF for years. Our relationship is deeply rooted and important, covering a range of fields and topics,\u201d said KKL-JNF Chairwoman, Ifat Ovadia-Luski.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that today's tree-planting commemoration provides the bereaved families a place of solace, a piece of land that will grow and flourish. I believe that today's ceremony and our ongoing activities with the Druze community will continue to deepen our important connection,\u201d Ovadia-Luski said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the families planted olive trees in the KKL-JNF Ahihud Forest in northern Israel to honor their loved ones who fell while defending the country.\n\n\u201cOur sons sacrificed themselves for the security of the state. For us Druze, this is our country too, and it is our duty to protect and defend it,\u201d said Imad Habka father of Lieutenant Colonel Salman Habka from Yanuh-Jat village. Salman Habka was commander of the 53rd battalion in the Barak Brigade and fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cWe sacrificed our dearest loved ones, who left behind grieving families, parents, wives, and children. They deserve to be commemorated and remembered at every opportunity. KKL-JNF's dedication to their memory is deeply moving, and this way, everyone has a place to honor our sons,\u201d said Imad.\n\n\u201cThe planted trees will stand as living testimony to the bravery of the fallen and symbolize the partnership between Druze and Jews. KKL-JNF, as a national institution of the Jewish people, believes in and desires a partnership with the Druze community,\u201d said Shaykh Tarif.\n\n\u201cThe country is no longer the same as it was before but remains in the covenant between the Jewish people and the Druze community, a covenant created by exceptional individuals whom we remember today and will always remember,\u201d Shaykh Tarif added.\n\n\u201cI hope that this beautiful site will mark a new path in the relations between the community and the Jewish people, thanks to the fallen we commemorate and the shared belief that together we will strive for a better future,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to KKL-JNF, this planting underscores the preservation of their memory alongside KKL-JNF's \u201cvalues of growth and renewal.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the war, KKL-JNF held a tree planting event in memory of those murdered at the site of the Nova Music Festival. Relatives planted more than 300 trees there in honor of their loved ones who died on October 7th.\n\nOver the years, KKL-JNF has created various projects to strengthen ties with the Druze community. One of them is called the \"Paths of Sons\", which spans about 250 km (155 miles), connecting Druze villages on Mt. Carmel and in the Galilee, featuring 18 initial landmark stones.\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of participants join a race that follows the \u201cPaths of Sons.\u201d\n\nAnother project, \u201cCovenant of Brothers, Covenant of Life\u201d, which began in 2016, marks \u201cthe special bond between the Druze community and the State of Israel\u201d and takes place in the Ahihud Forest. Hundreds of youth march here each year to express \u201ccentral values of brotherhood, cooperation, and hope for a shared future,\u201d KKL-JNF says.",

From the beginning, we have said that we support Gaza,\u201d he told The Associated Press at the group\u2019s political office in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.\n\nExperts say a full-scale war would devastate Lebanon and cause major destruction inside Israel. Still, without a diplomatic solution or military campaign to drive Hezbollah back, it's unlikely Israeli citizens can return home.\n\nSheikh Insists Halt to Fighting in Gaza Would End Hezbollah Attacks\n\nSo the sheikh says if Israel wants the daily attacks from Hezbollah to stop, it needs to cease fighting Hamas in Gaza.\n\nOr as he said of the Gaza war, \u201cIf the next phase is a cease-fire, we will stop firing in Lebanon.\"\n\nBut Kassam adds if Israel insists on war with his terror group, it could well spin out of control. It might even drag in other nations, like Hezbollah's sponsor Iran.\n\n'No One Knows the Repercussions'\n\nThe sheikh explained, \u201cNo one knows the repercussions of igniting the war locally, regionally, or even internationally.\"\n\nIsraeli officials are trying to head off a war with Hezbollah. But if war does come, they warn Israel will repeat in Lebanon the kind of massive destruction it's already brought to Gaza.\n\nIran Represents an Even Greater Danger to Israel\n\nOn Tuesday, the commander of Iran's Aerospace Force declared his soldiers are eager to launch another aerial assault on Israel.\n\nThe first happened on April 13th when Iran launched close to 350 projectiles against the Jewish state. Israel and an allied force, including the U.S., France, the UK, and Jordan, shot down nearly 99 percent of those weapons.",

        "body": "It once was lost, but now it\u2019s found.\n\nThat\u2019s the story surrounding a Georgia man\u2019s beloved Bible, which had gone missing for months before the persistence of a good Samaritan changed everything.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nWilliam Bailey lost his Bible in January, when it fell off his car before he went to church one Wednesday. Bailey told The Courier Herald he had prepared a message to share at church that night and had it tucked inside his Bible before he set the book on his car for a moment.\n\n\u201cWe were getting ready to leave, and I sat [the Bible] on top of my car, and my granddaughter called and wanted me to come back inside the house for something,\u201d he told the outlet, explaining he forgot to grab the Bible and put it in the car before driving off. \u201cWe got to church, got out, and I thought I had forgotten my Bible.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he realized the book was gone. He and his wife, Dot, prayed for it to be found, but months went by, according to The Courier Herald.\n\nBailey said he was \u201csick\u201d over the loss and felt he would simply never find it again. Still, being selfless at his core, Bailey told his wife he hoped \u201cwhoever found it got some good out of it.\u201d\n\nLittle did he know, someone did find the Bible. A man named Barron Howard, Jr. discovered it in the family\u2019s driveway. And when his grandma, Barbara James, heard about the surprising find, she set out on a mission to locate its rightful owner.\n\n\u201cIf I lost my Bible, I would really want it back,\u201d she told The Courier Herald. \u201cI would hope that whoever found it would go the extra steps to find it and get it back to me. I just couldn\u2019t rest.\u201d\n\nJames truly didn\u2019t stop trying, but she wasn\u2019t getting anywhere; she couldn\u2019t find any information in the Bible that would lead her back to the mystery owner. James reportedly did find a number inside the Bible and phoned it twice a day \u2014 but no one answered.\n\nThat misfortune changed, though, when she noticed a zipper she had previously overlooked. Inside, she discovered a pamphlet for Faith Baptist Church. It was just the lead James had been desperately looking for. She called the pastor and found out about Bailey\u2019s search for the Bible.\n\nThen, the preacher told Bailey about James, and the two connected \u2014 a blessed miracle for Bailey, who was convinced his beloved Bible had been long obliterated by a lawn mower.\n\nJames recently brought the Bible to Dot, who works at a nursing home, and the families connected. Bailey is ecstatic, realizing not everyone would have gone to such lengths to get it back to its owner.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sentimental stuff to me,\u201d Bailey said of sermon notes and personal commentary inside the Bible. \u201cI thank the Lord that I got it back.\u201d\n\nJames is simply overjoyed she was able to help. Bailey gave her a financial gift for returning his beloved Bible.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "Want to Connect with Gen Z? Invite Them Over for Dinner",
        "body": "ANALYSIS\n\nGen Z is maturing within an unprecedented culture of media saturation. The entire world, via the internet, is available to them at all times on their smartphones.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not always a happy place, nor is it one that\u2019s particularly easy to make sense of. As such, their relationship with media, with themselves \u2014 and with other people \u2014 is complicated in a number of ways we are still realizing.\n\nBut what if I told you they, just like us, crave and seek out the advice and consolation of trusted people in their real lives when they\u2019re struggling? What if I told you that most prefer to connect face-to-face rather than through technology?\n\nYou might be surprised. After all, the mainstream depiction of Gen Z is often a teen endlessly scrolling on their phone, beset by depression and anxiety, falling slowly away from family and faith.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what they\u2019re like at all. According to recent data in The RELATE Project, the majority of Gen Z wants to talk to trusted parents, mentors, and friends when they\u2019re struggling. Gen Z is seeking connection and intentional relationships. They are surprisingly grounded, community-oriented, prayerful, and intentional as a demographic.\n\nThankfully, breaking down the walls between Gen Z and older generations seems to be something anyone and everyone can do, if they choose. The adolescents interviewed for The RELATE Project were quick to express a desire for authentic, no-fuss dinner-table conversations, recognizing that such an environment lends itself towards engaging in meaningful discussions about life and what\u2019s on their minds. Sharing life and authentic conversations\u2014where both sides listen\u2014also promotes relationship.\n\nThat means that any one of us can make a difference in the lives of Gen Z. Any one of us can open our homes to them, welcome them into our families, and invite them to share their lives, struggles, and joys at our side.\n\nSo invite them for dinner. Ask them to stay awhile. If we want them to flourish, we must unabashedly fling open the doors of our homes to the younger people in our midst, allowing them access to our dinner table, yes, but most importantly to our experiences, our lived wisdom, our relationship with God, our kindness, our time, and even our challenges.\n\nWhy? Because face-to-face interactions in an intimate, authentic setting can be the catalyst for a meaningful, long-term relationship of trust and respect. These relationships provide emerging adults with the tools \u2013 and the relationships \u2013 they need to thrive now and later on.\n\nOf course, feeding them isn\u2019t the only thing you need to do when they sit down at your table. The most important thing is to listen to them without judgment. They may not always want or even need our advice, but they do need us to actively listen \u2013 so be engaged and attentive. A simple \u201cTell me more,\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d or \u201cWhat else?\u201d shows that you are listening and creating space for those at your table to share with ease. Just as Kelly Corrigan advocates in her show Tell Me More, asking thoughtful questions leads to better connections and conversations.\n\nMy family made a practice of intentionally sharing our daily highs and lows at dinner. We found that, in doing so, we laid the groundwork for more complicated, personal, probing conversations \u2014 conversations that involved community concerns, faith, friendships, sorrows, and the future. These conversations were a tremendous gift to all of us, and I cherish the intimacy and authenticity we shared over those meals.\n\nThe kitchen table became a place to share the funny stories of our days, the struggles, and how we saw God showing up in our lives. I think our adult kids still feel safe to come to us now thanks in part to relationships built around the dinner table when they were young.\n\nBut this sense of safety, belonging, and trust shouldn\u2019t be limited to our own children or immediate family. It can be extended to every person whose lives we touch, though it may look very different from home to home or from person to person.\n\nYou can, for instance, become the available parent or grandparent, the house where all the kids hang out after school, and create a space of hospitality \u2013 where all are welcome. Because it\u2019s in those moments of carpooling, dishing out snacks, and opening your home after baseball or dance practice that opportunities arise to express that they are welcome, valued, and cared about \u2014 and that they belong.\n\nCarving out time to build authentic relationships with Gen Z matters. They\u2019ve told us they need us. They\u2019ve told us how they need us. So let\u2019s listen.\n\nDr. Kimberly Nollan is the director of research and evaluation at Young Life.",

        "title": "Florida farmers turn to an ancient tree from India as the state\u2019s once-famous citrus industry dries up",
        "body": "An ancient tree from India is now thriving in groves where citrus trees once flourished in Florida, and could help provide the nation with renewable energy.\n\nAs large parts of the Sunshine State\u2019s once-famous citrus industry have all but dried up over the past two decades because of two fatal diseases, greening and citrus canker, some farmers are turning to the pongamia tree, a climate-resilient tree with the potential to produce plant-based proteins and a sustainable biofuel.\n\nFor years, pongamia has been used for shade trees, producing legumes \u2014 little brown beans \u2014 that are so bitter wild hogs won\u2019t even eat them.\n\nBut unlike the orange and grapefruit trees that long occupied these rural Florida groves northwest of West Palm Beach, pongamia trees don\u2019t need much attention.\n\nPongamia trees also don\u2019t need fertilizer or pesticides. They flourish in drought or rainy conditions. And they don\u2019t require teams of workers to pick the beans. A machine simply shakes the tiny beans from the branches when they are ready to harvest.\n\nTerviva, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2010 by Naveen Sikka, then uses its patented process to remove the biopesticides that cause the bitter taste, making the beans suitable for food production.\n\n\u201cFlorida offers a rare opportunity for both Terviva and former citrus farmers. The historical decline of the citrus industry has left farmers without a crop that can grow profitably on hundreds of thousands of acres, and there needs to be a very scalable replacement, very soon,\u201d Sikka told The Associated Press. \u201cPongamia is the perfect fit.\u201d\n\nWhat is the pongamia tree?\n\nThe pongamia is a wild tree native to India, Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\nThe legume is now being used to produce several products, including Panova culinary oil and protein, which are featured ingredient in Aloha\u2019s Kona protein bars. The company also makes protein flour.\n\nThe legumes also produce oil that can be used as a biofuel, largely for aviation, which leaves a very low carbon footprint, said Ron Edwards, chairman of Terviva\u2019s board of directors and a long-time Florida citrus grower.\n\nTurning a wild tree into a domestic one hasn\u2019t been easy, Edwards said.\n\n\u201cThere are no books to read on it, either, because no one else has ever done it,\u201d he said.\n\nBees and other pollinators feast on the pongamia\u2019s flowers, supporting local biodiversity, Edwards said. An acre of the trees can potentially provide the same amount of oil as four acres of soy beans, he added.\n\nWhat\u2019s left after the oil is removed from the pongamia bean is \u201ca very high-grade protein that can be used as a substitute in baking and smoothies and all kinds of other plant-based protein products,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for the food industry and the oil and petroleum industry.\u201d\n\nWhy Florida?\n\n\u201cWe know pongamia grows well in Florida, and the end markets for the oil and protein that come from the pongamia beans \u2014 biofuel, feed, and food ingredients \u2014 are enormous,\u201d Sikka said. \u201cSo farmers can now reduce their costs and more closely align to the leading edge of sustainable farming practices.\u201d\n\nAt a nursery near Fort Pierce, workers skilled in pongamia grafting techniques affix a portion of the mother tree to a pongamia rootstock, which ensures the genetics and desired characteristics of the mother tree are perpetuated in all of Terviva\u2019s trees.\n\nPongamia vs. citrus\n\nCitrus had been Florida\u2019s premier crop for years until disease caught up with it starting in the 1990s with citrus canker and later greening.\n\nCitrus canker, a bacterial disease, is not harmful to humans, but it causes lesions on the fruit, stems and leaves. Eventually, it makes the trees unproductive.\n\nCitrus greening, also known as Huanglongbing, slowly kills trees and degrades the fruit, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Greening has spread throughout Florida since 2005, devastating countless groves and reducing citrus production by 75%. The disease has spread to Louisiana, Texas and California.\n\nHurricane Ian caused about $1.8 billion in damages to Florida\u2019s agriculture in September 2023, hitting the citrus industry at the beginning of its growing season.\n\nDisease and climate issues have also affected most of the world\u2019s top citrus-producing countries. For example, this year\u2019s harvest in Brazil \u2014 the world\u2019s largest exporter of orange juice \u2014 is forecast to be the worst in 36 years because of flooding and drought, according to a forecast by Fundecitrus, a citrus growers\u2019 organization in Sao Paulo state.\n\nBut climate and disease have little effect on pongamia trees, the company\u2019s officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just tough, a jungle-tested tree\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt stands up to a lot of abuse with very little caretaking.\u201d\n\nPongamia also grows well in Hawaii, where it now thrives on land previously used for sugarcane.\n\nWhat are citrus farmers saying?\n\nJohn Olson, who owns Circle O Ranch, west of Fort Pierce, has replaced his grapefruit groves with 215 acres (87.01 hectares) of pongamia trees.\n\n\u201cWe went through all the ups and downs of citrus and eventually because of greening, abandoned citrus production,\u201d Olson said. \u201cFor the most part, the citrus industry has died in Florida.\u201d\n\nWhile the grapefruit grove was modest, it was common for a grove that size to be profitable in the 1980s and 1990s, Olson said.\n\nEdwards said farmers used various sprays to kill the insect that was spreading the disease. Eventually, the cost of taking care of citrus trees became too risky.\n\nThat\u2019s when he decided to go a different route.\n\n\u201cWhat attracted me to pongamia was the fact that one it can repurpose fallow land that was citrus and is now lying dormant,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom an ecological point of view, it\u2019s very attractive because it can replace some of the oils and vegetable proteins that are now being generated by things like palm oil, which is environmentally a much more damaging crop.\u201d\n\nWhat about biofuel?\n\nIn December 2023, Terviva signed an agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation to provide biofuel feedstock that can be converted into biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Mitsubishi is off to a great start,\u201d Sikka said, noting that the company coordinates closely with Mitsubishi on tree plantings and product development and sales. \u201cTerviva\u2019s progress has accelerated thanks to Mitsubishi\u2019s expertise and leadership around the globe on all facets of Terviva\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nWhat food products does pongamia produce?\n\nThe research is ongoing, but Edwards said they have made really good graham crackers in addition to the table oil and other plant-based protein products, including flour and protein bars.\n\nPongamia offers an alternative to soybean and yellow pea protein \u201cif you don\u2019t want your protein to come from meat,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "Alec Baldwin is about to go on trial in the death of \u2018Rust\u2019 cinematographer. Here are key things to know",
        "body": "Nearly three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed on the New Mexico set of the film \u201cRust,\u201d Alec Baldwin is going on trial over her death. Here are the essential things to know.\n\nWhat charge does Alec Baldwin face?\n\nThe actor is about to enter a New Mexico courtroom for the first time since the Oct. 21, 2021 shooting. He is charged with felony involuntary manslaughter. If a jury unanimously convicts him, he could get 18 months in prison.\n\nBaldwin, the star and co-producer of the Western, was pointing a revolver at Hutchins during a rehearsal in a small church on the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the gun fired.\n\nTwo major themes will predominate, one large, one small: the chaotic atmosphere of the movie set, and the details of the Italian-made classic revolver that Baldwin pointed at Hutchins.\n\nIt has never been officially determined who brought the live rounds that killed Hutchins on to the set. Prosecutors at the previous trial of \u201cRust\u201d armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed alleged that she was responsible. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to the same 18 months in prison Baldwin faces.\n\nWhat jurors must decide\n\nProsecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge. One is based on the negligent use of a firearm. The other is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin acted with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others.\n\nDespite the legal and technical complexities of the case, the 12 citizens of Santa Fe County that will make up the jury will have to reach just one verdict \u2014 guilty or not guilty \u2014 on a single count.\n\nHow long is the Alec Baldwin trial expected to last?\n\nThe trial at the First Judicial District Court of New Mexico \u2014 about 20 miles northeast of the movie set and the shooting \u2014 is projected to last nine days, and Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer insists that she\u2019ll keep the lawyers in line and on schedule. Jury selection begins Tuesday, with opening statements expected Wednesday, and the projected end the following Friday. Once the jurors get the case, however, they can deliberate as long as needed.\n\nWhy is Alec Baldwin famous?\n\nBaldwin, 66, emerged as a major movie star in the late 1980s and early \u201890s through films like \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October,\u201d and has remained a household name ever since. He would move on to memorable supporting roles in films including 2003\u2019s \u201cThe Cooler,\u201d which got him an Oscar nomination. Comedy dominated his later career as he won two Emmys for playing network executive Jack Donaghy on six seasons of \u201c30 Rock,\u201d and won a third for playing Donald Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nHe has also played the role of outsized public personality, as a cherished talk-show guest, a sought-after liberal, and at times as a man unable to control his outbursts of anger, which have brought public embarrassment and a previous run-in with the law much more minor than the current one.\n\nBaldwin is the eldest of six children \u2014 five of them actors \u2014 from Massapequa, New York, who has lived in New York City for most of his adult life. He has an adult daughter, Ireland Baldwin, with his first wife Kim Basinger, and seven small children with his second wife, Hilaria Baldwin.\n\nAlec Baldwin\u2019s defense\n\nBaldwin will bring with him an elite legal team of mostly New York-based attorneys, many of them Harvard Law graduates, from the firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Alex Spiro, a 41-year-old defense attorney who has represented Elon Musk, Megan Thee Stallion and other prominent figures and has become among the most sought-after lawyers in the country, will give aggressive cross-examination to the state\u2019s witnesses.\n\nThe defense will try to show that it is not the job of an actor to make sure real rounds are not in his gun, a position strongly supported by Baldwin\u2019s union, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\nBaldwin said in an interview with ABC News, and implied in interviews with authorities, that he never pulled the revolver\u2019s trigger.\n\nHis lawyers will also attack the gun evidence, and the serious damage done to the revolver during an FBI test they say amounted to the destruction of evidence and left the defense no chance to examine it.\n\nFirearms experts for the prosecution who testified at the Gutierrez-Reed trial are returning to the witness stand, over objections by Baldwin, to testify about his handling of the revolver and whether the gun was functioning properly.\n\nAnd they may press witnesses over whether Hutchins received proper medical treatment between the shooting and the declaration of her death at a hospital.\n\nThe prosecution team\n\nSanta Fe County District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies appointed Kari Morrissey as a special prosecutor in the Baldwin case in early 2023 after her predecessor stepped down because of conflicts of interest. Morrissey promptly had the indictment against Baldwin dismissed, but revived it in January of this year by grand jury. Both moves came from further examination of the evidence, she said.\n\nMorrissey graduated from the University of New Mexico and its law school, and practiced law in Albuquerque for more than 20 years. New Mexico criminal defense attorney Erlinda Johnson joined Morrissey\u2019s team in April.\n\nThe trial could bring a culture clash between the team of attorneys, as fiery hearings and filings have already shown.\n\nMorrissey and Spiro in particular have butted heads often \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and be called a liar!\u201d \u2014 she said during one such moment at a May hearing \u2014 and will likely do the same and provide some drama during the proceedings.\n\nThe prosecutors will try to convince jurors that as a producer and the most important person on the set, Baldwin brought a recklessness to the production, and that as an actor he was negligent in handling his gun.\n\nWho\u2019s expected to testify at the Alec Baldwin trial\n\nThe crew members inside the small church building who became eye-witnesses to Hutchins\u2019 killing will provide the trial\u2019s most essential testimony. They include director Joel Souza, who was himself shot and wounded by the bullet from Baldwin\u2019s gun, and assistant director David Halls, the film\u2019s assistant director, who some said was responsible for the shooting but pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm.\n\nZac Sneesby, a crew member who was holding a boom microphone during the rehearsal, will testify that he saw Baldwin pull the trigger of the revolver, prosecutors said in court filings, making him potentially the most important witness of all.\n\nProsecutors also may call Gutierrez-Reed to the stand, but Marlowe Sommer rejected an immunity deal they wanted to give her.\n\nJurors will hear testimony from firearms experts who allege the revolver was working properly could not have fired without pulling the trigger.\n\nAnd Baldwin himself can take the stand in his defense, but he doesn\u2019t have to. His attorneys have not said which he will do.\n\nWhere the \u2018Rust\u2019 shooting happened\n\nSanta Fe, New Mexico\u2019s capital, an arts mecca of 89,000 people and a tourist destination for its historic Southwestern beauty, is no small town. And its downtown modern legal complex is hardly a country courthouse. But the location is still a far cry from the coastal urban courts where the celebrity trials of Bill Cosby, O.J. Simpson, Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump were held.\n\nThe proceedings could make for an unusual scene. Scores of members of the national media will compete for seats in the Santa Fe courtroom and an overflow room, and cameras will surround the courthouse for arrivals and departures.\n\nAnd the public can watch. The trial will be streamed and broadcast by several outlets including Court TV.\n\nWho is Halyna Hutchins?\n\nHutchins, who was 42 when she died, was a cinematographer on the rise and a mother of a young son when she was killed. She grew up on a remote Soviet military base and worked on documentary films in Eastern Europe before studying film in Los Angeles and embarking on a promising movie-making career.",
        "summary": "Nearly three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed on the New Mexico set of the film \u201cRust,\u201d Alec Baldwin is going on trial over her death.\nBaldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the gun fired.\nProsecutors at the previous trial of \u201cRust\u201d armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed alleged that she was responsible.\nHow long is the Alec Baldwin trial expected to last?\nHe has an adult daughter, Ireland Baldwin, with his first wife Kim Basinger, and seven small children with his second wife, Hilaria Baldwin.",

        "body": "In the running debate between actively managed funds versus simply investing in a fund that tracks the S&P 500, the scorecard continues to tilt toward the broad stock market index.\n\nAccording to data from Morningstar Direct, just 18.2% of actively managed funds whose primary prospectus benchmark is the S&P 500 managed to outperform the index in the first half of this year.\n\nThat\u2019s on track to be worse than last year, when only 19.8% of actively managed funds beat the S&P 500.\n\nOf course, some years are better for fund managers than others. In 2022, when the Federal Reserve launched its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades and sent the S&P 500 tumbling, 63.3% of active funds outperformed. In 2014, only 14.2% did.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the average share of active funds that beat the S&P 500 was 27%, setting up 2024 to be an especially weak year.\n\nData from Morningstar Direct also shows that 13.4% of passively managed funds are outperforming so far this year. And over the past decade, passive funds consistently trailed active funds in the share that beat the S&P 500.\n\nBut that\u2019s not surprising given that many passive funds are only looking to keep pace with the index and maintain lower expenses rather than charge higher fees and hope that they get bigger returns.\n\nTo be sure, the vast majority of the S&P 500\u2019s recent gains have come from just a handful of tech giants. That leaves index investors vulnerable to a selloff in one stock like Nvidia. Still, even as Nvidia has come well off its highs over the past few weeks, the index has continued to hit fresh records as other stocks climbed.\n\nMeanwhile, separate data showed that the S&P 500 beat three out of every four exchange-traded funds in the past year, the worst showing for ETFs since at least 2010.\n\nIn addition, funds that are diversified across asset classes and geographies also fared worse than the S&P 500. Such portfolios have lagged the index in 13 of the last 15 years, according to data from Cambria Funds cited by Bloomberg. Other data showed that out of 370 asset-allocation funds tracked by Morningstar, just one has beaten the index since 2009.\n\n\u201cIn a low-volatility, high-return environment like 2024, investors should stick to the basics \u2014 buying uncomplicated index funds, and active mutual funds with a proven track record of delivering alpha,\u201d Evercore strategist Julian Emanuel told Bloomberg last month. \u201cNo need to complicate strategy. In simplicity there is beauty.\u201d",

        "body": "The U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1% in June from 4% in the prior month, nearly triggering a reliable recession indicator.\n\nWhile unemployment is still historically low, its rate of increase could be a sign of deteriorating economic conditions. That\u2019s where the so-called Sahm Rule comes in.\n\nIt says that when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months, then a recession has started. This rule would have signaled every recession since 1970.\n\nBased on the latest unemployment figures from the Labor Department\u2019s monthly report on Friday, the gap between the two has expanded to 0.43 in June from 0.37 in May.\n\nIt\u2019s now at the highest level since March 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic-induced crash.\n\nThe creator of the rule, Claudia Sahm, was an economist at the Federal Reserve and is now chief economist at New Century Advisors. She has previously explained that even from low levels a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession.\n\n\u201cWhen workers lose paychecks, they cut back on spending, and as businesses lose customers, they need fewer workers, and so on,\u201d she wrote in a Bloomberg opinion column in November, adding that once this feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates.\n\nBut she also said the pandemic may have caused so many disruptions in the economy and the labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule that are based on unemployment may not be as accurate right now.\n\nA few weeks ago, however, Sahm told CNBC that the Federal Reserve risks sending the economy into a recession by continuing to hold off on rate cuts.\n\n\u201cMy baseline is not recession,\u201d she said on June 18. \u201cBut it\u2019s a real risk, and I do not understand why the Fed is pushing that risk. I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re waiting for.\u201d\n\nThat came days after the Fed\u2019s June policy meeting when central bankers kept rates steady after holding them at 5.25%-5.5%\u2014the highest since 2001\u2014since July 2023.\n\nThe Fed meets again at the end of this month and is expected to remain on hold, but odds are rising that a cut could happen in September.\n\nSahm also said last month that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s stated preference to wait for a deterioration in job gains is a mistake and that policymakers should instead focus on the rate of change in the labor market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone into recession with all different levels of unemployment,\u201d she explained. \u201cThese dynamics feed on themselves. If people lose their jobs, they stop spending, [and] more people lose jobs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street has had a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year\u2019s widespread recession predictions that proved wrong as well as the AI boom that\u2019s helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.\n\nLast month, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager Steve Eisman also pointed to the boost in infrastructure spending.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just powering through, and I think the only conclusion you can reach is that the U.S. economy is more dynamic than it\u2019s ever been in its history,\u201d he told CNBC.",

        "body": "Americans on average say they need to earn more than $186,000 a year to live comfortably, according to a recent Bankrate survey, down 20% from a year ago.\n\nDifferent demographic groups had different income thresholds, but they all declined\u2014except for one. Gen Z respondents said they need to make $200,000 a year to feel comfortable or financially secure, up 3.6% from Bankrate\u2019s 2023 survey.\n\nMeanwhile, every other age group lowered their income thresholds. And when looking across different gender and racial/ethnic groups as well as Americans with kids or without, income thresholds also fell (with Gen Z and the other age cohorts included in those groups too).\n\nGen Z was also an outlier on what it would take to feel rich. On average, Americans said they need to earn $520,000 a year to reach that status, up 7.7% from a year earlier.\n\nIncome thresholds for most demographic groups saw comparable single-digit percentage increases, while Gen X\u2019s saw a slight dip. But Gen Z\u2019s was up a whopping 20.7% to $461,000.\n\nThe changes in what Americans think they need to earn to come as they also report feeling more financial insecurity. In fact, while the level of income for living comfortably dropped, it\u2019s still more than double the average full-time income of $79,000.\n\nThe latest Bankrate survey said 25% say they are completely financially secure, down from 28% in 2023, while 75% were not completely financially secure, up from 72% in 2023.\n\n\u201cMany Americans are stuck somewhere between continued sticker shock from elevated prices, a lack of income gains and a feeling that their hopes and dreams are out of touch with their financial capabilities,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate\u2019s senior economic analyst, in the report.\n\nThe share of Gen Z respondents who felt financially secure saw a dip to 24% from 25%. But they were the most optimistic of the different age groups, with 64% saying they are not completely secure now but will be someday. That compares with 53% for millennials, 48% for Gen X, and 26% for baby boomers.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the rising cost of living, heavy debt burdens, and the historically unaffordable U.S. housing market that now requires a six-figure income to afford a median-priced home.\n\nMeanwhile, separate surveys have found that Gen Z and millennials are increasingly suffering from \u201cmoney dysmorphia\u201d that has skewed how they view themselves financially.\n\nAccording to an Intuit Credit Karma survey in January, 45% of Gen Zers and millennials are obsessed with the idea of being rich, with 48% of Gen Zers and 59% of millennials feeling behind financially.\n\n\u201cMoney dysmorphia is kind of like today\u2019s version of keeping up with the Joneses,\u201d Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, wrote in the report. \u201cA lot of people are examining their finances and comparing themselves to their peers, people on social media, and even celebrities, which is bringing up feelings of inadequacy.\u201d",
        "summary": "Gen Z respondents said they need to make $200,000 a year to feel comfortable or financially secure, up 3.6% from Bankrate\u2019s 2023 survey.\nGen Z was also an outlier on what it would take to feel rich.\nThe latest Bankrate survey said 25% say they are completely financially secure, down from 28% in 2023, while 75% were not completely financially secure, up from 72% in 2023.\nThe share of Gen Z respondents who felt financially secure saw a dip to 24% from 25%.\nMeanwhile, separate surveys have found that Gen Z and millennials are increasingly suffering from \u201cmoney dysmorphia\u201d that has skewed how they view themselves financially.",

Cava, 68, was elected as the county\u2019s first woman mayor in 2020. The position is nonpartisan.\n\nA spokesperson for Griffin didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request seeking comment outside of business hours.

Unlike Suarez, a one-time Republican presidential contender who\u2019s come under fire for conflicts of interest on his side jobs, Cava\u2019s position is full time.

        "body": "Turkey will soon unveil an agreement with BYD Co. to construct a $1 billion plant in the west of the country, Turkish officials said, boosting the Chinese carmaker\u2019s presence in Europe at a time of escalating trade tensions.\n\nTurkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to announce the accord on Monday during a ceremony in Manisa province, where the plant will be built, the officials said, asking not to be named because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. BYD representatives and the president\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nThe new factory would improve BYD\u2019s access to the European Union, because Turkey has a customs-union agreement with the bloc. The EU moved ahead this week with plans to impose provisional tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, hitting BYD with an additional 17.4% charge on top of the existing 10% rate.\n\nThere\u2019s also a domestic market to serve, with EVs accounting for 7.5% of car sales last year in Turkey, a country with a population of almost 90 million.\n\nTurkey announced Friday that it was walking back plans announced almost a month ago to impose an additional 40% tariff on all vehicles from China, citing efforts to encourage investment. That decision followed talks between Erdogan and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on Thursday during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Astana, Kazakhstan.\n\nBYD has been on a tear the last several years in China, becoming the nation\u2019s best-selling car brand. The Shenzhen-based manufacturer has vowed to bring its lower-priced EVs to Europe in the coming years, including the Seagull hatchback that executives expect to sell for less than \u20ac20,000($21,700).\n\nThe automaker opened its first EV plant in Southeast Asia on Thursday, in Thailand. BYD has also taken over a former Ford Motor Co. factory in Brazil and been scoping out locations for a plant in Mexico. Its first car factory for Europe, in Hungary, is under construction.\n\nBYD\u2019s sales jumped to a record 982,747 vehicles in the second quarter, up more than 40% from a year ago. While the company\u2019s sales in Europe have been sluggish thus far, it\u2019s mounting a major marketing push in the region, taking Volkswagen AG\u2019s place as a main sponsor of the European Championship football tournament.",

        "body": "In March, Asia\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani threw a three-day prenuptial bash for his son that included a 1,200-person guest list, including former world leaders, tech tycoons and Bollywood\u2019s megastars, and a performance by renowned singer Rihanna.\n\nIt was only the start of their months-long lavish pre-wedding celebrations which have grabbed headlines and set off a social media frenzy.\n\nIn May, the family took guests on a 3-day pre-wedding cruise from Italy to France, which included a DJ set from David Guetta, Katy Perry belting out her hit song \u201cFirework\u201d and a performance by Pitbull to cap it off, according to media reports.\n\nFinally, the wedding is set for next week, with Anant Ambani, 29, marrying his longtime girlfriend, Radhika Merchant, in what many have dubbed the wedding of the year.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nWho are the Ambanis?\n\nThe father of the groom is Mukesh Ambani, 66, currently the world\u2019s 9th richest man with a net worth of $116 billion, according to Forbes. He is also the richest person in Asia.\n\nHis Reliance Industries is a massive conglomerate, reporting over $100 billion in annual revenue, with interests ranging from petrochemicals, and oil and gas to telecoms and retail.\n\nThe Ambani family owns, among other assets, a 27-story private apartment building, named Antila, worth $1 billion in Mumbai. It has three helipads, a 160-car garage, a private movie theater, a swimming pool, and a fitness center.\n\nAmbani\u2019s critics say his company has flourished mainly because of political connections during the Congress governments in the 1970s and 80s and subsequently under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s rule after 2014. They say \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d in India has helped certain corporations, such as Ambani\u2019s, thrive.\n\nThe family patriarch has started passing the torch to his two sons and daughter. The oldest son, Akash Ambani, is now chairperson of Reliance Jio, their telecoms business; his daughter, Isha, oversees retail, while the groom Anant, the youngest, has been inducted into the new energy business.\n\nWho are the bride and groom?\n\nAnant has a bachelor\u2019s degree from Brown University, according to Reliance Industries\u2019 website, and oversees the conglomerate\u2019s renewable and green energy expansion.\n\nHe also runs a 3,000-acre (nearly 1,200-hectare) animal rescue center called Vantara in Gujarat state\u2019s Jamnagar, the family\u2019s hometown where guests in March spent days celebrating in the extravagant pre-wedding party.\n\nThe bride, Radhika Merchant, 29, is the daughter of pharmaceutical tycoon Viren Merchant and is the marketing director for his company, Encore Healthcare, according to Vogue.\n\nShe told the magazine that the two were introduced through mutual friends in 2017. \u201cThat first meeting just sparked something special between us, and it wasn\u2019t long before we started dating,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen\u2019s the wedding and what\u2019s expected?\n\nThe main wedding ceremony is set for July 12, followed by a grand reception on July 14, according to local media. Celebrations are expected to be split between the Ambani\u2019s Jio World Convention Center in Mumbai city and their family home.\n\nThe dates were reportedly chosen based on the couple\u2019s birth charts, as is typical in Hindu custom, and deemed auspicious. Also keeping with tradition, the wedding will be preceded by days of traditional wedding events and rituals.\n\nOn Friday, Indian social media was abuzz with videos from the couple\u2019s sangeet, a ceremony where the bride and groom\u2019s families perform dances for the guests. It also included performances by Bollywood stars like Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan as well as Justin Bieber, who flew to Mumbai for the event, according to local media.\n\nThe family also organized a mass wedding for more than 50 underprivileged couples last week, as part of the pre-wedding celebrations.\n\nExtravagant parties are the Ambanis\u2019 specialty and next week\u2019s events are expected to draw more celebrities, billionaires and world leaders.\n\nIn March for the pre-wedding bash, the guest list included Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, former leaders of Canada and Qatar as well as Bollywood\u2019s A-list stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. In addition to Rihanna, Akon and Diljit Dosanjh, a Punjabi singer who shot to international fame when he performed at Coachella, also took the stage.\n\nIn 2018, when his daughter married, Ambani made the headlines because of the grand celebrations, with pop sensation Beyonc\u00e9 performing at the pre-wedding festivities. At the time, former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who rubbed shoulders with Indian celebrities and Bollywood stars in the western Indian city of Udaipur.",

Sometimes the suit wears the man, sometimes the man wears the suit.\n\nHere's a quick cheat sheet to the man: a big table. Marius loves big tables. To laugh, bond, eat. I had been briefed that he is a man of few words, slicing the fat off his sentences for lean, quick, ripostes. He is Dutch after all, who are not known for beating around the bush.\n\nBut it\u2019s the bush that calls Marius. I can tell because he lights up when he talks about his runs, the animals he sees, and the terrain. Oh, the terrain. \u201cA hill after every other kilometre!\u201d he says, wiping the expression off his face, and I am not sure whether he is elated or dissatisfied. What\u2019s that the Dutch say? \u201cHet is zoals het is.\u201d It is what it is.\n\nDo you remember your first time on a plane?\n\nYes, in The Netherlands. We had domestic flights, I must have been around five years old. I was on a trip with my grandparents, about 100km. The second time was when I was around 13, the first big trip I went with my family to the United States (US).\n\nDid you know you\u2019d get here?\n\nIt was a coincidence, opportunistic even. I was in college in The Netherlands, doing my Master's thesis and needed an internship. My roommate worked at KLM and he recommended an internship there, and voila. Here we are.\n\nWhat was your biggest culture shock in Kenya?\n\nI have experienced different cultures in my career and wasn\u2019t too worried about it. Kenyans and the Dutch are not so different, sometimes, perhaps not everybody says things directly here but in general people speak their minds.\n\nIf you were guaranteed success would this still be the career you chose?\n\nYes. I have been lucky in my 12 years at KLM. I have spent a decade outside France, experiencing different people and cultures. I have been privileged.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one place you\u2019ve gone to that has stayed with you?\n\nAtlanta in the US. Being brought up as a child in the 90s in Western Europe, American pop culture seemed the coolest place to be. I was very excited but it was a bit of a letdown when I experienced it, haha! But Kenya has been great too, to live in the vibrancy of Nairobi and the nature sceneries just hours outside the city.\n\nDid you pick up any pop culture tendencies in your sojourn in the States?\n\nIt was a bit of a disappointment, from my perspective [chuckles].\n\nWhat makes you, you?\n\nHard questions now, eh haha! I am an open-minded, laid-back guy, not easily stressed looking for pragmatic solutions in day-to-day life\u2014both at work and in my private life. I try not to worry too much; I like to know where we are going but the way to get there is open.\n\nYou seem quite analytical.\n\nIt depends on where you work in the airline. I have worked longer in the commercial side of the airline\u2014pricing\u2014and I have enjoyed figuring out how to make the money, and how to price the tickets. The other side is about safety and procedures to guarantee safe and reliable operations and good customer focus.\n\nHow have you remained spontaneous in your life?\n\nMy family and I like to go out in nature. We have two small children and two dogs, and on the weekends we settle in and drive to the Nairobi National Park or outside the city.\n\nAre you a bush or a beach person?\n\nHmm. In the end, I\u2019ll have to go with bush.\n\nWho is the dog person between you and your wife?\n\nWe both are! I have always had a dog, even before I was born, we had a dog in the family. The first chance we got when we were living together with my wife, we got a dog.\n\nWhat have the dogs taught you?\n\nDogs live extremely in the moment. They only see what is happening at that moment in your life, and they are very reactive to behaviour in general. They have taught me you get back what you give immediately. I believe that is also true in business.\n\nWhich is easier\u2014running a family or a business?\n\nSometimes running a business is easier because my position has a bit more weight than it does in the family.\n\nWhat kind of father are you?\n\nI like to give my children space. I give them boundaries and let them do their thing and find their way but let them know they can come to me when they have questions.\n\nWere you raised the same way?\n\nMy wife and I were raised with a bit more boundaries, perhaps that is why. [chuckles]\n\nWhat do you miss most about your childhood?\n\nI had a fortunate childhood. I had a lot of freedom within the boundaries, but it was such a free careless time. Sometimes you long for that freedom.\n\nHow are you remaining childlike now?\n\nI try not to worry too much about things I cannot control.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest insecurity as a father?\n\nIt is mostly a worry that something inevitable will happen. At one point I told my parents that I was not happy about a list of things [chuckles]. My wife and I talk about this: do you remember the point you started telling your parents what you were not happy about? I know my children will tell me too at some point, and it will always be the things you don\u2019t expect. So far, I can still defend my choices.\n\nMarius van der Ham poses for a picture after the interview on July 3, 2024. Francis Nderitu | Nation Photo credit: Francis Nderitu | Nation Media Group\n\nWhat is the one question you are asking yourself right now?\n\n[Long pause] The role I have now: are we as the men doing the right things for the teams we work with and does it align with what we want to achieve with the business? How can we improve? Am I being the person my family would like to sit at the table with?\n\nAre you a head or a heart person?\n\nMainly head. I like rationality and logic, but I have a heart family so that is complex.\n\nHow so?\n\nI have a very passionate wife, with much more heart, which is good. My son is three and my daughter is six years old, and she has a tendency to go for the heart more than the head at this point. It forces me to go a bit more to my heart; sometimes people give me feedback that I could use a bit more heart.\n\nIs it easy being a head person in a heart world?\n\nIt\u2019s my default, so it makes it easy but it doesn\u2019t always make me well-liked [chuckles].\n\nIs there a decision you made using the head when you should have gone with the heart?\n\nYou can adjust yourself to the situation, but what is the maximum? Maybe five percent? 10 percent? The 90 percent is you and if you force it, it wouldn\u2019t work. I think.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one thing you wish more people understood about you?\n\nI generally have the interest of everybody I work with at heart. When you ascend the corporate ladder, decisions get less popular and less easy. You get judged for that and it sometimes feels unfair. Generally, I can handle it but sometimes I think, why am I the bad guy here? I wish people would know that it comes from the best interests.\n\nThey say the higher you go, the lonelier it becomes. Is it the same for you?\n\nTo some extent. I have a good management team so we lean on each other for support. When you are the person who has to make the final decision, then it can seem a bit lonely.\n\nWhat do you do just for you as a man?\n\nI was never a sportsperson. Throughout my 30s, I got into general fitness, gym, and running which is what I like to do to relax.\n\nHow often do you run?\n\nI was training for the Lewa Marathon which unfortunately was cancelled. I do it once a week, but now I do more gyming. I have done half marathons, one or two marathons et al.\n\nWhat do you think about when you are working out?\n\nIt depends. Things just come up. When I am training, I am doing math\u2014I look at my pace, and try to calculate my distance and time taken. It\u2019s become my routine now. Sometimes, I get Eureka moments and great ideas while running, just like people who have ideas in the shower.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most boring part about running?\n\nThe hard part is getting out of the door, haha! It\u2019s not boring especially not here, because running in the Netherlands is just flat, no hills, but here, after every kilometre or so, there is a hill waiting for you [chuckles].\n\nHave you had a strange encounter on your drills?\n\nA lot of monkeys and dik-diks. That is why I was so excited about the Lewa Marathon. We try again next year; I hope our tickets are still valid, haha!\n\nHow do people show you love?\n\nI love being around friends, at a big table with drinks, having a conversation. I have had the same group of friends since high school, for over 30 years. We go away for a weekend yearly and the only thing we are looking for apart from the accommodation is a big table [chuckles]. We love that table where we can just talk.\n\nWhat do you bring to that table?\n\nI am a bit of a jokes guy. I keep it light and put the atmosphere in the group. But I also like it when we get into deep serious conversations, giving each other advice.\n\nWhat\u2019s a special memory you have shared with your friends that is close to your heart?\n\nWhen we were children, it was about getting our first jobs, as adults it was the drastic changes\u2014losing parents, et al. We live in different parts of the world, but at that table, we get each other.\n\nWhat matters less than you thought it would?\n\nYour title and position. If you don\u2019t act in a way that makes it easy to work with the people who make your life, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or claim to be.\n\nWhat have you finally come to terms with?\n\nThe easy answer is that perhaps I will not become a professional soccer player. At least, not anymore [chuckles]. I am an ambitious person, but I have learned that aiming for something and developing toward it is an achievement in itself. You don\u2019t need to achieve everything you set your mind on.\n\nWhat is the soundtrack of your life right now?\n\nGood one. I am a bit of a soft guy, so you'll find me watching a bit of romcom movies and my wife would be like, are those tears in your eyes? I would of course shake my head, haha! But in music, I am a rock guy, Guns N\u2019 Roses is my go-to band.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most romantic thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nYou are putting me on the spot here. Okay, without spilling everything, my wife and I struggled to have children, it took a long time and of course, it was a hard thing, especially for my wife. What I used to do was to write and hide little notes throughout the house, in her bag, and at her workplace. It was small and personal notes of encouragement, and in the end, it worked.\n\nIf you could tell me just one thing, what would you tell me?\n\nHave I not told you enough? [chuckles]. I don\u2019t know, Eddy.\n\nFair enough. Whom do you know that I should know?\n\nTough question! I am at my wit's end here. [long pause]\n\nOkay then, what do you know that I should know?",

        "body": "President William Ruto has announced a Sh177 billion spending cuts and Sh169 billion in additional borrowing to plug the budget hole left after the withdrawal of the Finance Bill, 2024.\n\nPresident Ruto, in a live address from State House, said the government would present a proposal to the National Assembly to approve the expenditure cuts after the withdrawal of the Bill intended to raise Sh346 billion in new taxes.\n\nThis, the President said, would ensure funding of key budget lines, including the hiring of 46,000 Junior Secondary School teachers on a permanent and pensionable basis, recruitment of medical interns, provision of money to buy milk from farmers at Sh50 per litre, and the retention of the fertiliser subsidy.\n\nOthers are the funding to complete stalled road projects, payment of coffee debt and the proposed Coffee Cherry Fund, public-owned sugar firms to pay debts to farmers, new varsity funding and arrears owed to counties, the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NGCDF) and pension.\n\nOverlapping mandates\n\nThe measures will also include the dissolution of 47 State corporations with overlapping mandates, the end of harambees (fundraising) for all State officers, and the removal of confidential budgets in all offices, including his own.\n\nThese were among the raft of measures announced by Dr Ruto at State House, Nairobi following youth-led protests against increased tax measures, which saw the rare climb-down to drop the Finance Bill, 2024, which was rejected by most Kenyans as punitive.\n\nOn harambees, President Ruto said Attorney General Justin Muturi had been tasked to prepare a law to effect the ban on all State officers participating in such. The law, he said, would also include regulations on philanthropic activities.\n\nAt the same time, the President announced the end of funding to the offices of the First Lady and those of the spouses of the Deputy President and the Prime Cabinet Secretary.\n\nThe President also suspended the filling of the offices of the Chief Administrative Secretary, for which he had proposed 50 people but their appointment was blocked by the courts.\n\nParliament has since passed a new law allowing their appointments, which will now cease following the head of State\u2019s pronouncement.\n\nPresident Ruto also suspended the purchase of motor vehicles for all government agencies and departments for one year, except for the security teams.\n\nDebt forensic audit\n\nThe Head of State suspended all non-essential travel for all civil servants and reduced the budget for government buildings renovations by 50 percent.\n\nHe also announced the reduction of advisors in government, recently budgeted to gobble up Sh1.1 billion in their budgets for those only advising the President.\n\nPresident Ruto also announced that all public servants would retire at the age of 60, \u201cwith no exceptions whatsoever.\u201d\n\nOn public debt, President Ruto announced the formation of an independent taskforce to conduct a forensic audit of the debt.\n\nThe team is to report in three months and is to clarify on the extent and nature of Kenya\u2019s debt, as well as recommend proposals to manage the skyrocketing debt.\n\nX space\n\nFollowing the speech, Ruto hosted a live audio forum on X meant to engage with young people. He faced sharp questioning about policy brutality, corruption and economic policy.\n\nOne activist involved in the protests, Osama Otero, questioned Ruto about alleged abductions of protesters by state security agents, saying he had been taken at 3 am by men in plain clothes, blindfolded and taken to a house to be questioned.\n\n\"Mr President, are we in a terrorist country?\" Otero asked.\n\nRuto, who had previously denied police involvement in dozens of reported disappearances, apologised for the treatment Otero had suffered and promised to take action on his case.\n\nProtests have continued since Ruto scrapped the finance bill, with many demonstrators calling for the president to resign. But turnout has been down and some activists have called for a rethink of their strategy after Tuesday's demonstrations were marred by violence and looting.\n\nActivists have blamed the violence on thugs hired by politicians to discredit the protest movement. The government has said that opportunistic criminals are responsible.\n\nHere is a summary of new proposed austerity measures:\n\n47 State corporations with overlapping functions to be dissolved. Staff in affected agencies to be transferred to ministries and agencies.\n\nChief Administrative Secretaries (CAS) office suspended.\n\nPresidential advisors reduced by 50 percent with immediate effect.\n\nBudget for First Lady and spouses of Deputy President, and the Prime Cabinet Secretary removed.\n\nConfidential budget in State House, all offices removed.\n\nRenovations reduced by 50 percent.\n\nNo extension past 60-year retirement for all civil servants.\n\nPurchase of vehicles suspended for 12 months, except for security agencies.\n\nAll non-essential travel suspended.\n\nNo state officer, public servants will participate in harambees. Attorney General to submit law to this effect on harambee, philanthropic and charitable ventures.\n\nChanges in government to be announced soon.",

Annually, the daily numbers are known to rise as the deadline approaches.\n\nTo allow more taxpayers to file their returns, the taxman extended its working hours in all service centres around the country, and select Huduma and contact centres to assist taxpayers in filing their returns within the timelines.\n\nFiling returns has emerged as one of the taxman\u2019s preferred ways to net tax cheats and grow the income tax segments amid struggles to meet collection targets.\n\nThe law requires anyone with a KRA personal identification number to file returns irrespective of employment status.\n\nThe taxman has failed to meet revenue targets in recent years on tax defaulters and a small tax base that does not include the majority of the self-employed and those working in the informal sector.\n\nKRA recorded its highest shortfall in tax collections from employees in the first nine months of the current financial year which ends on June 30, despite introducing two tax bands targeting top earners.\n\nA quarterly report published by the National Treasury shows that the KRA missed its pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) target by Sh72.3 billion in the period to March this year.\n\nThe taxman had a target of collecting Sh463.3 billion from salaries in the period ending March, but only raised Sh390.96 billion, which means it missed its target by 15.6 percent, the highest shortfall according to available data.\n\nIn the Finance Act 2023, the Income Tax Act was amended to introduce two individual tax bands.",

        "body": "Keir Starmer will be Britain's next prime minister with his centre left Labour Party expected to win a huge majority in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative government by trouncing Rishi Sunak's party.\n\nWith many results still to be announced from Thursday's vote, centre-left Labour has already won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament, with an exit poll suggesting it would capture about 410.\n\nOn a humiliating night for Sunak, the Conservatives have so far only won 70 and were predicted to suffer the worst performance in the party's long history with voters punishing them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services, and a series of scandals.\n\n\"Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken and they're ready for change, to end the politics of performance, a return to politics as public service,\" Starmer said after winning his seat in London.\n\n\"The change begins right here ... You have voted. It is now time for us to deliver.\"\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of Britain's Labour Party and his wife Victoria Starmer attend a reception to celebrate Starmer's win in the election, at Tate Modern, in London, Britain, July 5, 2024. Photo credit: Reuters\n\nSunak conceded defeat and said he had called Starmer to congratulate him on his victory.\n\n\"Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides,\" he said after regaining his seat. \"There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates ... I am sorry.\"\n\nDespite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party, and he comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.\n\nBritain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.\n\nHe has already had to scale back some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, while he has promised not to raise taxes for \"working people\".\n\nMuch of the heavy damage to the Conservative support was inflicted by the right-wing populist Reform UK party, headed by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, who had campaigned strongly on curbing immigration.\n\nStarmer has promised to scrap the Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but will be under pressure himself to find a solution to stopping tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel on small boats.\n\nWithin the Conservative party, the recriminations and debate over its future direction immediately began, with some saying its failure stemmed from abandoning the centre ground while others argued Reform had won over voters who felt the party had deserted its roots.\n\nReform captured four seats, with Farage himself finally being elected to parliament at his eighth attempt, and won more votes than the Conservatives across swathes of the country.\n\n\"There is a massive gap on the centre right of British politics and my job is to fill it, and that's exactly what I'm going to do,\" a triumphant Farage said. \"Believe me, folks, this is just the first step of something that is going to stun all of you.\"\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of Britain's Labour Party and his wife Victoria Starmer greet supporters as they attend a reception to celebrate Starmer's win in the election, at Tate Modern, in London, Britain, July 5, 2024. Photo credit: Reuters\n\nThe rise in support for a populist alternative echoed recent similar results in Europe, where the far right have been surging.\n\nBut, unlike France where Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party made historic gains in an election last Sunday, overall the British public has plumped for a centre-left party to bring about change.\n\nStarmer has promised to improve relations with the European Union to resolve issues created by Brexit, just as far-right politicians are enjoying success. However, despite opposing Brexit, rejoining the European Union is not on the table.\n\nHe may also have to work with Donald Trump in the United States if he wins November's presidential election, but he has vowed to continue London's unequivocal support for Ukraine.\n\nThe election victory would represent an incredible turnaround for Starmer and Labour, which critics and supporters said was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have lost its way after its 2019 drubbing.\n\nBut a series of Conservative scandals - most notably revelations of parties in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns - undermined then prime minister Boris Johnson and its commanding poll leads evaporated.\n\nLiz Truss' disastrous six-week premiership, which followed Johnson being forced out at the end of 2022, cemented the decline, and Sunak was unable to make any dent in Labour's now commanding poll lead.\n\nSunak stunned Westminster and many in his own party by calling the election earlier than he needed to in May with the Conservatives trailing Labour by some 20 points in opinion polls, and his campaign then proved a disaster.\n\n\"We deserved to lose. The Conservative Party just appears exhausted and out of ideas,\" Ed Costello, the chairman of the Grassroots Conservatives organisation, which represents rank-and-file members, told Reuters.",

        "title": "George Odenyo: the CEO with nothing on his desk",
        "body": "If you broke into George Odenyo\u2019s office at Delta Corner Annex you would face two puzzling scenarios. One, you wouldn\u2019t be able to nick anything, and two, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to know what he does for a living. This is because his office is bare.\n\nThere is a table with a computer. No papers. No trays, no photos of his family. No trophies. There is a lonesome coat hanger and a small glass plaque that his children gifted him for Father\u2019s Day. It brings to mind that quote by Ram Dass: \u201cEmptiness is not really empty, emptiness is full of everything. The \u2018everything\u2019 just isn\u2019t manifest.\u201d Or he might just be a minimalist.\n\nOdenyo is the CEO of American Tower Company (ATC) Kenya Operations, a subsidiary of American Tower Corporation. It is an American real estate investment firm that owns, develops, and operates wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure - towers, telecom masts - in several countries. ATC owns about 4,000 towers across Kenya that host Telkom, Safaricom, Airtel, and other small telecom companies on a shared infrastructure platform.\n\nHis resume is as minimalist as his office; he\u2019s worked in two organisations, according to his LinkedIn profile. For 14 years he worked with MTN Business, leaving as Head of Finance. Then five years with Eaton Towers as Finance Director before the company was acquired by ATC.\n\nYour desk is so bare. Are you a minimalist or are you hardly in the office?\n\nI have the right team in the company so my desk doesn\u2019t have to look busy. Part of me is also opposed to holding onto things, I try to release them as soon as possible. If there's nothing I can do with it, I give it to the next person who can address it.\n\nWhat does it take to build one?\n\nFirst, our customer, the operator, has to identify where they want the tower, which is driven by need, often determined by the population. We will then acquire the site, and get the necessary permits from the National Environmental Management Authority, Kenya Civil Aviation, and county governments. Once we acquire the site we erect the tower and then power it with a grid.\n\nAs a numbers guy, how do you find transitioning to dealing with people?\n\nWell, I have appreciated that as a leader, you are as strong as your people. I have led teams in my previous roles so it\u2019s not entirely new. People can be difficult but the trick lies in figuring out how to understand them. Everybody is motivated by something; a dream or ambition and it\u2019s upon you to connect them with whatever it is. So my job is to find how their dreams connect with the company's dreams.\n\nAnd what's your dream?\n\nMake life better for me, my family, and my community. I seek to be impactful, and valuable; to change the world.\n\nDo you feel like you are doing that here at ATC, building towers?\n\nYes, I am. Our purpose is to build a more connected Africa. Towers connect people by enabling them to communicate well. Most misunderstandings come from people not being able to communicate.\n\nDid you always want to be in finance?\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t know about finance until later. When I was in high school my late father invited somebody to have a chat with me, a guy who had excelled in his high school and was then in university. The talk was not more than five minutes. He talked about CPA (Certified Public Accountant) a lot. He said it was something I could do as I waited to go to university. I was sold on the idea. I then eagerly waited for KCA to announce applications in the newspapers. I would bother the principal (St Marys Yala) for the newspaper every week to check if the call was out. That\u2019s how I came across Strathmore in the newspaper and applied and eventually enrolled.\n\nSo if this fellow was a doctor do you think you would have been influenced to study medicine?\n\nYes, definitely. However, in high school, I was good at electricity and my dream was to be an electrical engineer. But this guy came earlier before that could happen. [Chuckle]\n\nAmerica Tower Corporation Kenya CEO George Odenyo during the interview on June 24, 2024 at his office in Nairobi. Photo credit: Billy Ogada | Nation Media Group\n\nIs there a chance that you might still pursue that love?\n\nNo, I'm in that environment either way. I have so many engineers here. So I still enjoy what I do because of that. In hindsight, I think there's a reason why things happen the way they happen. I have no regrets.\n\nHave you had conversations with yourself about what your purpose is, and why you are here? Are you here to build masts?\n\nI think we are in this world to create an impact, to make a difference. I believe that helping others is integral to our purpose. I have benefited from the generosity of others in my entire journey, some of whom were not even my relatives. So I\u2019m also doing the same. It makes me happy to see others excel. My earlier years were instrumental in shaping who I have become.\n\nBy the time I was joining the University of Nairobi, I was already done with part two of my CPA which allowed me to get an internship that eventually turned into a job. Against the wishes of my parents and the advice of other people close to me, I decided to drop out of university. I completed my CPA later at Catholic University. I also did a Bachelor of Commerce at the same university. I have worked and learned, not the other way around.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nI\u2019m 45 now. I was born in Pumwani but my dad moved to the village when I was five or so years old. It's a place called Ugunja in Nyanza, you might know it. I struggled academically in my earlier years until around Class Six when I met a teacher who changed how I viewed academics and helped me excel. I\u2019m the only son in a family of three girls and that didn\u2019t help in those years when I was not performing well because my mom was on my case.\n\nWhat was the impact of growing up in a family of girls as the only boy?\n\nQuite interesting. You learn a lot about women without realising it. But also perhaps that made me more empathetic to women. I wasn\u2019t spared from chores because I was the only boy, in fact, sometimes I was made to do a little more. My dad believed in me. Unfortunately, he died when I was 25 years old.\n\nWho filled the role of a father for you after he died?\n\nWhen he died I became the 'father' in the family. My mom handed everything over to me. She died two years ago.\n\nDo you have children?\n\nI have three; an 18, a 17, and a 10-year-old. A boy and two girls. This is a plaque they gifted me for Father\u2019s Day.\n\nCan you believe you have a 18-year-old?\n\n[Laughs] Yes, I can. It's because I started so early. I started working at 21 and that changed my life because when money started coming in, my old man, to ensure I did not get lost, encouraged me to find a wife and settle down. So at 25 I was already married and I started a family immediately.\n\nWhat bits of fatherhood do you find very challenging?\n\nBecause I grew up in a different time it\u2019s challenging to appreciate the circumstances that our children are growing up in now. It\u2019s often difficult to relate to them and their situation. Everything is different and sometimes you want your child to see things your way but they can\u2019t. You have to accept that it is their life and love them. You cannot control their lives. But I try as much as possible to make sure that I pass the right baton to them.\n\nDo you think you're successful?\n\nAs a father?\n\nNo, as a man who lives and works.\n\nI don't talk about success. I talk about being valuable. Am I valuable? Yes, for sure. I believe that as long as you are valuable out here in the community, in society, and in the family, then success will follow you.\n\nHow do you know for certain that you're valuable?\n\nBecause of what you're able to give. You are valuable because of what you are giving at work, at home, and in your community. I believe that as long as you are growing, over time you become valuable. You become valuable by the knowledge that you can share and by the guidance you can give. And that way success can follow you in this season.\n\nWhat are some of the most difficult things you are experiencing in this season as a man?\n\nThings are moving so fast and I wonder if I will achieve everything I have set out to achieve. But other than that, I think it's a beautiful time to be alive, to be a father, to be a leader, to be living and doing things that need to be done.\n\nWhen your son gets to the age where he says, I found a wife.

        "body": "The workplace is experiencing a historic transformation as more and more younger people whose lives revolve around the Internet of Things, mobile phones, and social media are hired.\n\nWith the latest breed of employees being outspoken, outgoing, and carefree, Gen Z is rewriting norms and daily practices that define a workplace.\n\nAway from the four-walled offices with a kitchen and boardroom, as well as individual offices for senior management, we now have a hybrid mode of working that allows people to work away from the office and for longer hours than older generations ever did.\n\nWith the Internet readily available everywhere, knowledge of labour rights has expanded, and we now interact more virtually than physically.\n\nSocial media sites are now considered official modes of communication. Not to mention the change of the official (office) dress code, the new \u2018normal\u2019 hardly observes any mode of dressing as part of office etiquette, and performance is gauged on the delivery of tasks assigned.\n\nWhat this means to organisations is that to attract and retain the best and brightest of Generation Z, it will require a different mindset. A large percentage of Gen Z is characterised by their passion for technology, knowledge, creativity, risk-taking, multi-skilledness, and readiness to adjust to new changes, especially technology-driven ones.\n\nI have witnessed the workplace evolution of aspirations from just being a good salary to the new \u2018normal\u2019. Gen Z is looking for a flexible work programme, opportunities to grow within the organisation, transparency in communication, diversity, and inclusion, and is considering how the work environment will affect their mental health.\n\nIn my experience as an HR practitioner, I have adjusted to accommodate Gen Z demands. This is an extremely impatient lot, but they are smart, hardworking, and risk-takers with a knack for perfection. This is a group of people who prefer instant feedback as opposed to an end-of-review set period for appraisal to take place.\n\nI have learned the importance of creating room for them to vent, speak their mind, and, if possible, have a one-on-one conversation aimed not at criticising but at implementing solutions. As a human relations professional, help employees connect their strengths to their work by providing training and development opportunities.\n\nWhat about Gen Z\u2019s level of engagement and the need for constant attention, fuelled partly by social media? Well, ensure that the expectations for the outcome are clear at the beginning of the contract and have regular checks in, if possible, monthly.\n\nGen Z employees want to feel safe, valued, and productive. It is about creating an environment where employees use their strengths every day. By embracing these changes and understanding Gen Z\u2019s values, businesses can position themselves for future success.\n\nCommunicate clearly and on time if there are any changes, allow room for creativity in the process of delivering work and finally ensure that you have supplied tools necessary to deliver work.",

        "body": "Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Kamau Thugge spoke to the Business Daily recently in the backdrop of his first year in office. The interview covered many subjects under his mandate, including foreign exchange, monetary policy, currencies, and the banking industry.\n\nYou had made the tough choice between raising domestic interest rates and cushioning the exchange rate with an adjustment to the benchmark lending rate, has this been the right course of action?\n\nIn a sense, it\u2019s choosing your poison. In my view, you need to deal with inflation and anchor inflation expectations, because if you don\u2019t, if inflation becomes something you can\u2019t control it affects the entire economy and ultimately, banks will not have negative real interest rates.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t push up interest rates and allow inflation to go to 30 percent, no bank will lend to you at less than 30 percent, so you will still have higher interest rates.\n\nAre we now at equilibrium with the shilling or at least close to it?\n\nRight now, there are significant foreign inflows but who knows\u2026for the time being we see stability and we don\u2019t interfere unless it\u2019s a sharp appreciation or depreciation. Broadly we allow the market to tell us what the equilibrium rate would be and so I wouldn\u2019t say whether we are at this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in core capital will trigger amalgamation in the industry, especially for banks unable to raise the higher Sh10 billion capital, will we see you forcing marriages between banks?\n\nI think we will allow it to play out between the banks and you know we have a microfinance sector. If you can\u2019t generate enough capital, it doesn\u2019t mean you shut down. Unless asked to be intermediate, I wouldn\u2019t see the need to force mergers.\n\nThere is a fear of creating concentration risks where you have big banks swallowing up everyone, Is this farfetched for you?\n\nI think we will still have quite a few banks, I don\u2019t think the issue of concentration is a concern. For purposes of competitiveness, having bigger banks enhances competitiveness. Right now when you have just a few big banks, they set the stage so to speak, and then the smaller banks just follow. Having bigger and more competitive banks will help us even lower interest rates.\n\nThere has been a push for an expanded mandate for the CBK in terms of the regulation of entities, do you feel the bank can take on more?\n\nWe have submitted some amendments to the Act to move away from digital credit to just credit because a lot of these credit providers are not always on digital platforms.\n\nYour predecessor was somewhat hands-off in terms of engaging stakeholders like banks, is your approach as a regulator different?\n\nMine is somewhat different, I have tried to engage the stakeholders as much as possible and we have had regular meetings with bank CEOs and their heads of treasuries.\n\nThey were part of resolving the exchange rate problem. I wouldn\u2019t want the hands-off approach, but that\u2019s not to suggest that we won\u2019t be very hard on them if they don\u2019t comply.\n\nOne of the first observations I made is that there seemed to be a number who were not complying because the penalties were so low. The penalties we are bringing on board will bring sanity, where banks will think twice before violating any CBK provisions.\n\nWhere do we stand today on the creation of a central bank digital currency?\n\nThe main conclusion was that given where we are in terms of financial inclusion, where we are quite ahead of others in terms of digital payments, going to a central bank for digital currency was not a priority, and this stand remains. Having said that, however, we need to keep up with what\u2019s going on in that space.\n\nLast year, CBK indicated it had no demand for new notes and coins, and we saw De la Rue pausing its business subsequently. Some might tell you they haven\u2019t seen any new notes around, has that demand returned?\n\nIf you look at currency in circulation, relative to gross domestic product, Kenya\u2019s is very low compared to countries like India. There will always be a need for some currency, but at the same time, there are developments in digital payments that continue to reduce the need for new currency. There will always be a need, but that need will keep reducing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should we expect more of from the CBK going into your second year in office?\n\nI\u2019ll take you back to the mandate, and the first is price stability. I think going forward we would like to maintain that, and we have already modernised our monetary framework.\n\nSecond is the stability of the financial system\u2014my vision is to have that stability\u2014fewer but stronger banks, which will not just come from a regional perspective.",

        "body": "The value of foreign currency loans and deposits held in local banks fell by Sh504.9 billion in three months ended March on the backdrop of a strengthening Kenya shilling, easing concerns about the lenders\u2019 exposure to external risks.\n\nDeposits in foreign currency fell sharply in the period, dropping to Sh1.63 trillion from Sh1.91 trillion in December 2023 as gains in local currency depleted the holdings of offshore notes in Kenya shilling terms.\n\nForeign currency loans equally fell, touching Sh990.2 billion from Sh1.21 trillion at the end of 2023.\n\nThe fall in foreign currency loans and deposits is a relief to banks after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of high exposure.\n\n\u201cThe share of FX (foreign currency) loans declined somewhat in the third quarter of 2023 but remained higher than a year ago. Currently, an unremunerated cash reserve ratio of 4.25 percent applies to a bank\u2019s total domestic and FX deposit liabilities and is filled in shilling. There are no additional capital requirements on FX loans or exposure caps on FX loans,\u201d the IMF observed in a January report.\n\nThe share of Kenya\u2019s total foreign currency liabilities stood at 34.9 percent as of September 2023, beating the median of 31.6 percent for emerging and developing economies.\n\nThe IMF observed that foreign currency deposits were on the increase even after factoring in the depreciation of the exchange rate, which signalled a nominal increase in hard currency holdings across 2023.\n\nThe accumulation was attributable to banks increasing their ownership of foreign currency to service the government-to-government oil importation deal that started in March 2023 and to expectations of the continued depreciation of the Kenya shilling.\n\nThe multilateral lender underlined risks, including foreign currency access difficulties, in its caution against accumulating hard currency credit, particularly for foreign currency loans.\n\n\u201cA non-trivial portion of the FX loans are in sectors such as personal loans, real estate, transport and communication, and building and construction; it\u2019s unclear to what extent borrowers in these sectors have a natural hedge as these sectors are not main export sectors,\u201d the IMF added.\n\n\u201cBanks report that with the ongoing dollar shortage, FX borrowers who are unable to source for US dollars in the local market have been offering repayment in shilling, effectively defaulting on the loans and contributing to the rise in non-performing loans.\n\nFirms and businesses had resorted to contracting hard currency loans to access dollars amid the foreign exchange crisis observed across 2023.\n\nForeign currency liquidity has, however, improved through 2024 following reforms and interventions to halt the depreciation of the Kenya shilling, which have encouraged new inflows of hard currency into the economy.\n\nThe Kenyan shilling has been a gainer against major world currencies including the US dollar since mid-February and is part of the best-performing currencies in the world this year.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya quoted the local unit at Sh128.7 against the US dollar on Tuesday, representing gains of over 19 percent for the shilling on a year-to-date basis.",

        "body": "Airtel Uganda\u2019s majority shareholder Airtel Africa is set to sell additional shares amounting to a 9.11 percent stake in a secondary offer to comply with a requirement to offload a minimum ownership of 20 percent to minority investors trading on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE).\n\nThe multinational in November 2023 managed to sell 4.35 billion shares equivalent to a 10.89 percent stake in Airtel Uganda\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) that was open to domestic and foreign investors including Kenyans, failing to meet the ownership rule.\n\nAirtel Africa says in its latest annual report that it received a regulatory extension to sell the balance of 3.64 billion shares by November 2026, a move that will see it replicate the moves by MTN Group, which successfully offloaded a 20 percent stake in MTN Uganda in two transactions including a secondary offer concluded last month.\n\n\u201cOn November 7, 2023, Airtel Uganda listed 10.89 percent of its shares on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) in compliance with Uganda Communications (Fees and Fines) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, which created an obligation for all national telecom operator licensees to list 20 percent of their shares on the USE,\u201d Airtel Africa says in the report.\n\n\u201cThe USE granted Airtel Uganda an extension until 6 November 2026 to offer the shortfall to achieve the 20 percent listing.\u201d\n\nAirtel Africa sold its shares at a price of UGX100 (Sh3.47) each in the IPO that also offered incentive shares on a band of subscription volumes to attract investors. Retail investors who applied for more than 2,500 shares, for instance, received 10 free shares for each 100 shares allocated. Institutional investors who applied for at least 1.85 billion shares were offered 112 free shares for each 100 shares allocated.\n\nDespite the incentive shares, which amounted to a discount on the offer price, the IPO only managed a subscription rate of 54.45 percent in a transaction that saw Uganda\u2019s National Social Security Fund (NSSF) take up about 97 percent of the allocated shares.\n\nThe below par performance of the telco\u2019s IPO was partly attributed to exclusion of Airtel Money which is owned separately by Airtel Africa and a group of other institutional investors. MTN Uganda offered both its mobile money and telecommunications businesses to the investing public.\n\nAirtel Uganda\u2019s share price has declined post-IPO to trade at Ush70 (Sh2.45), indicating that its parent firm could offer deeper discounts to meet local ownership requirement in the impending secondary offer.\n\nAirtel Uganda, which offers data, SMS and voice services, has a policy of distributing at least 95 percent of net income as dividends.\n\nMTN Group sold an extra 7.03 percent stake in MTN Uganda\u2019s oversubscribed secondary offer last month, cutting its ownership in the subsidiary to 80 percent. It sold 1.57 billion shares at a price of Ush170 (Sh5.9) each in the transaction that featured incentive shares.\n\nThis was a larger discount compared to MTN Uganda\u2019s November 2021 IPO in which the multinational sold a 12.97 percent stake at a price of Ush200 (Sh6.95) per share while also offering incentive shares.\n\nPricing of the secondary offer took into account a drop in the share price of MTN Uganda, which currently stands at Ush170 (Sh5.9). The sale of MTN Uganda shares was open to Ugandan and foreign investors.\n\nMTN Uganda\u2019s successful secondary offer was also helped by extension of the book closure date for its final dividend of Ush6.4 (Sh0.22) per share from June 4 to June 12. This enabled investors who participated in the offer to qualify for the payout. The offer closed on June 10.\n\nMTN Uganda, which aims to pay out at least 60 percent of profits as dividends, has attracted notable Kenyan investors including billionaire Baloobhai Patel, Central Bank of Kenya and the National Social Security Fund.",

In March last year the lender issued an alert over an impending closure of its operations in three East African markets\u2014 Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania\u2014this year over worsening conditions.\n\nIt classified the three regions (Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania) including Ghana and Nigeria as \u2018turnaround markets\u2019 which are currently unfit for growth and appointed a turnaround master Fergus Ferguson, the former Chief Executive of Botswana with oversight over Eswatini and Lesotho (Boleswa), as the regional CEO to oversee their recovery in 10 months, failure to which a closure decision will be made this year to avoid further financial bleeding.",

        "body": "From the latest anecdotal evidence I have gathered, indications are that all is not well with the Affordable Housing Project which is touted as President William Ruto administration\u2019s biggest signature project.\n\nCurrently, a major controversy has erupted between the bureaucracy in charge of the project and a group of 33 consultants-mainly architects and quantity surveyors- over delayed payments.\n\nLast week, and with the financial year coming to a close, expectations were high that the consultants would be paid during the traditional end of fiscal year scramble when ministries rush to clear payments lest monies be returned to the Exchequer. A meeting called at a Nairobi hotel on Friday with the consultants resolved the dispute.\n\nIt is not a god sign because in view of the scope of this giant project, maintaining the support from the community and fraternity of consultants is critical to delivery and success.\n\nFrom what I have gathered from private conversations with the players in this space, it seems decision- making is impeded by lack of clear lines of command within the bureaucracy running the project.\n\nHolding an office is not the same thing as being in power. Cabinet Secretary Alice Wahome holds a big office and so does the Principal Secretary, Charles Hinga. But from my reading when I map the play of effective power and decision- making is that Housing Secretary, Said Athman, is also a very powerful player.\n\nClearly, rolling out this project is going to be the biggest test on President Ruto administration\u2019s capacity to successfully roll out large infrastructure projects. It reminds me of Francis Fukuyama\u2019s writings on the concept of State capacity, described as the ability of a government to deliver large infrastructure projects on time.\n\nWithin the region, the government of Ethiopia is regarded as having a better record at delivering projects on time and within budget. Does it surprise that we have contracted the Ethiopians to sell to us a lot of electricity from its dams? Even little Rwanda is rated higher than us in terms of capacity to implement large infrastructure in time and at cost.\n\nWe went into this massive affordable housing project without thinking through it properly and before agreeing on the feasible model. Clearly, the government has been involved in miss and hit experimentation.\n\nWhen it started, the model was based on an invitation to private sector to \u2018design, finance, build and transfer\u2019 affordable houses at fixed price of Sh50,000 per square metre on the guarantee of an off-taker. The government would buy all the units on completion. Indeed, the most attractive aspects of the programme was free land and the off-taker guarantee.\n\nThe next stage was to provide a proof of concept. This was achieved after President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s administration contracted the Chinese group, China State Corporation- who built and completed 1,300 affordable housing units in the Park Road area in Ngara, Nairobi.\n\nWith the concept having been approved, the Ministry of Lands and Housing went on a spree of advertising free land sites. I have lost count of the number of newspaper adverts put up by Mr Hinga to offer free land to developers in different parts of the country.\n\nAt some point, the model was suddenly changed from \u2018design, finance, build, and transfer\u2019 to a \u2018development split\u2019 model whereby the government would only guarantee off-take of 70 percent of the units, with the developer allowed to sell the remaining units at market rates.\n\nWith the change of model- and without an off-taker guarantee, the developers dried up. The second round of the project covering Starehe, and Shauri Moyo in Nairobi was hit by inadequate investor appetite. As a matter of fact, one developer walked away. The collapse of the housing levy bill was a big factor.\n\nIn January 2022, 59 sites throughout the country were advertised. Only Kingdom Developers and Gulf showed up. After the General Elections, Mr Hinga advertised 70 additional sites- including land belonging to the Kenya Police and Kenya Defence Forces. There was even a time when university student\u2019s halls were brought on board. Still, no serious takers.\n\nWith the advent of President Ruto\u2019s administration, the model changed again because-this time around- the housing levy had been enacted. The government now became the designer. All that was needed was to engage construction companies.\n\nAlthough the response to offers was very good, the bids were way higher than the fixed price of Sh50,000 per square metre. Consultants had to be brought in to review the designs. They have not been paid.",

        "title": "Manufacturing grows at slowest pace since 2008 post-poll crisis",
        "body": "The manufacturing sector posted the slowest growth in 16 years in the first three months of 2024, spooked by high production costs and a recent barrage of tax measures, dealing a blow to prospects of generating quality jobs in the economy.\n\nData by the Kenya National Bureau of Standards (Kebs) show that the sector grew by 1.3 percent in the quarter to March compared to 1.7 percent a year prior - the slowest pace since the same quarter of 2008 when it grew by a paltry 0.7 percent amid deadly violence and economic disruption caused by the disputed outcome of the 2007 presidential election.\n\n\u201cGrowth in the manufacture of food products was constrained by a 6.5 percent decline in soft drink production during the quarter under review. In the manufacture of non-food products, cement production declined from 2.3 million tonnes in the same quarter of 2023 to 2.1 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2024,\u201d KNBS stated in its GDP report for the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe poor growth performance leaves the sector-- which has the highest multiplier effect on the economy-- on the ropes despite being touted as a key pillar of the Kenya Kwanza administration, which sees industry driving the next phase of Kenya\u2019s economic transformation.\n\nThe slump in manufacturing puts a damper on the government's ambitions of raising the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP to 20 percent by 2030 as productivity falls. Local manufacturers, who are members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), have set the same target under their \u201820by30\u2019 agenda.\n\nThe share of manufacturing to Kenya\u2019s GDP stood at 7.6 percent in 2023 in contrast to a high of 10 percent in 2014. The sector also contributed just 9,700 of the 848,100 new jobs created in the economy in 2023 or 1.14 percent.\n\nIndustrialists cite a recent wave of punitive tax measures and high costs of production for the dismal performance in the sector.\n\nFor example, the export and promotion levy introduced through the Finance Act, 2023 set a tax of 17.5 percent of the customs value of imported cement clinkers and other manufacturing-related products such as bars and rods, impacting the cost of finished products from local manufacturers.\n\nOnly Bamburi Cement, Mombasa Cement, and Simba Cement manufacture clinker locally, according to KAM, highlighting constrained productivity by other cement makers on higher input costs.\n\n\u201cBecause of that constrained production, the capacity to manufacture cement has gone down while the cost of a bag of cement has risen from lows of Sh560 to upwards of Sh850 in some places. This has impacted other sectors such as construction and real estate,\u201d noted KAM CEO Anthony Mwangi.\n\nThe new taxes have exacerbated the struggles of a sector already bogged down by high production costs, including that of imports and electricity.\n\nCostly energy is being blamed on inefficiencies in generation, transmission, and distribution. Mr Mwangi said manufacturing has been shaken on both the demand and supply side, inhibiting gains for sector expected to carry the multiplier effect in the economy, including job creation.\n\n\u201cWe operate in an ecosystem and just looking at the overall economic environment, you look at interest rates going up, so has the cost of living which has hit the demand for manufactured products by consumers. On the supply side, we face high input costs including energy, taxes, and regulatory levies paid to entities such as Kebs [Kenya Bureau of Standards] and Nema [National Environment Management Authority] alongside the cost and tenure of credit. Everywhere you turn, costs come at you,\u201d he added.\n\nThe problems bedevilling manufacturing, according to KAM, include trade in counterfeit products, transport and storage issues, and weak access to credit financing.\n\nUnder its Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), President William Ruto identified key value chains, including leather, textiles, dairy, edible oils, building and construction materials, as important in efforts to boost manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP.\n\nKey allocations to the sector in the fiscal year ended June 30 included Sh4.7 billion for the establishment of county-integrated agro-industrial parks and Sh550 million for the completion of the Naivasha Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and the construction of Dongo Kundu SEZ.\n\nA further Sh2.8 billion was set aside for the development of the Athi River Textile Hub and Sh3 billion for six EPZ flagship hubs.\n\nIn January, the government revealed it would be putting up 30 additional county aggregation and industrial parks, lifting the number from an initial 18.\n\nThe push for new manufacturing infrastructure has come against the continued erosion of existing factories as industrial areas now face encroachment from entertainment spots after the barrage of residential houses.\n\nKAM, while acknowledging the drag on activity from the recent anti-tax protests in the country, sees the opportunity to overhaul government policies in the face of public discourse, resetting manufacturing back to the growth path.",

Boeing 737-300 aircraft operates medium haul routes.\n\nThe airline\u2019s officials had not responded to our query by the time of going to press.\n\nOn June 30 alone, at least 16 flights were either cancelled or delayed.\n\nThis includes KQ604, KQ608 and KQ618 to Mombasa, which were canceled. KQ270 to Mauritius was cancelled while KQ886 to Bangkok was delayed by eight hours and 50 minutes. On July 1, 2024, several flights were affected too. This includes flight KQ362 to Mogadishu and flight KQ 594 to Douala.\n\nThe national carrier has grappled with inadequate staffing and equipment in the wake of the global travel's recovery from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic that broke out in early 2020.\n\nKenya Airways had let go of some of its employees in 2020 to cut costs due to depressed earnings caused by the pandemic but has been hiring more in the past few years.\n\nThe airline is under pressure to deploy more crew members and aircraft to service routes that were idle during the Covid-19 period.\n\nThe country is also staring at a peak tourism season, which started early this month. The airline currently flies to 45 destinations and faces stiff competition, not just from major players like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines, but from African carriers as well.\n\nThe government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is the biggest regional threat and flies to more than 120 destinations.\n\nBoth Uganda and Tanzania have poured cash into their flag carriers in the past three years, joining countries such as Rwanda and Togo, which have also ramped up investment in their own carriers.",

Kenya\u2019s economy grew at a slower pace of five percent in the first three months of 2024 compared to 5.5 percent in the same period last year, in a period when the business environment was roiled by high interest rates.\n\nKNBS data shows that all the sectors, save for finance and insurance activities, recorded slower growth in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2023 pointing to a tough macro-economic environment.\n\nICT services are a catalytic backward and forward linkages across all other commercial segments and a slowdown in the sector gives a pulse on the state of the economy. For example, it supports financial services in aspects such as money transfers, e-commerce at nascent stages, improved public service in the case of e-government as well as human capital development through e-learning.\n\nThe deceleration comes despite aggressive State efforts to spur a national digital revolution through a raft of infrastructural and skill-development programmes.\n\nAmong the ongoing projects include the five-year scheme to lay down at least 100,000 kilometres of the national fiber optic cable, setting up 25,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots in major markets and trading centres across the country as well as establishing a digital hub in each of Kenya\u2019s 1,450 wards.\n\nThe ICT sector gained massive traction in the wake of the Covid crisis as the population shifted en masse from in-person interactions as part of government-backed measures aimed at containing the spread of the deadly virus.\n\nThe pandemic, for instance, propelled the enhanced provision of an array of services in computing and communication as witnessed through the surge in demand for fixed internet as people heeded to government calls to work from home as well as schools adopting e-learning.\n\nSince then, Kenya has continued to report significant progress in the digital transformation space at the global level with novel breakthroughs ranging from innovations in real-time data collection and management, to cybersecurity support systems as well as big data management.",

The closest similarity to a wealth tax in the country is the land rates, whose collection is relatively lower than other jurisdictions around the globe, and the Capital Gains Tax, which was last year raised from five percent to 10 percent. This is charged on the gains from disposal of an asset.\n\nStill, it appears Kenyans would like more taxes targeting only the wealthy and high-income earners.\n\nPresident William Ruto had alluded to the introduction of new wealth taxes at the onset of his administration in September 2022, when he told lawmakers that Kenya taxes trade more and wealth less.",

        "body": "Teaching 10-year olds how to stage a full scale theatre production might not sound like an easy affair, especially when you are talking about teaching musical theatre to more than 100 children who signed up for the theatre class taught by Joan Aywaya and Warucu Kijuu.\n\nBut on June 21, 2024, we saw how these two teachers took a hands-on approach by staging the award-winning musical, Matilda the Musical, at Brookhouse School in Karen. One of the few schools in Kenya where theatre is one of the core courses in the curriculum.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019d asked our students if they had any preferred play to stage, nearly all of them said they wanted Matilda,\u201d Joan told the BDLife right after the Friday evening show.\n\nIn the programme (which most theatre companies today don\u2019t bother to create anymore) the two teachers (turned into co-directors for their annual productions) wrote a synopsis which clarified how the musical is based on the beloved children\u2019s book by Roald Dahl about Matilda Wormwood.\n\nMatilda is a bit like Harry Potter who\u2019d lived with abusive elders, only Matilda\u2019s adults were actually her parents whereas Harry\u2019s elders are related to his magical deceased mom. Even Cinderella\u2019s story follows a similar storyline of neglect, child abuse, and jealousy fueling the nasty treatment of our morally superior hero and heroines.\n\nThe synopsis doesn\u2019t make comparisons between Matilda, Harry, and Cinderella, but it does note that Matilda isn\u2019t alone in being abused at school. Her fellow classmates also get physically beaten (corporal punishment) by the \u2018tyrannical Head Mistress, Miss Trunchbuli who hates children and runs Crunchem Hall with an iron fist.\u201d\n\nOne of Matilda\u2019s biggest deprivations is the lack of books in her home (her parents refuse to buy them for her). Her biggest blessing is meeting the school\u2019s kind and carrying Miss Honey who recognises Matilda\u2019s keen intelligence, curiosity, and delight in finding a place where she can read books to her heart\u2019s content.\n\nMiss Honey is also mistreated by Trenchbuli. Witnessing these injustices finally inspires Matilda to stand up to the tyrannical head teacher who was ultimately tamed by \u2018a touch of magic\u2019, humility, and intelligence.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too difficult to see how easily such a heart-warming story as Matilda could be understood by 10, 11, and 12-year-olds. But getting the pre-teens to understand all the nitty-gritty of staging a musical production might not be as simple. Nonetheless, putting that challenge is what the BDLife saw coming to life in Brookhouse\u2019s weekend show.\n\nJust sitting down with the cast and stage crew enabled students to see and learn how really good directors can behave. And when the directors are also helping their students understand the meanings behind the words, lines, and lyrics that they will sing, dance, and narrate, is even better.\n\nIt meant that teachers Joyce and Warucu were illustrating other aspects of effective directing. Some cast members may have already been involved with theatre through their churches so they too know how challenging learning lines can be, but that too is part of the teachers\u2019 task, to not only memorise their lines but also understand the meaning of those lines.\n\nIn a few cases, as the BDLife watched this fun production, it was easy to tell that not everyone spoke their lines with conviction although they knew their timing and kept their line up as in their chorus line. But when those few who didn\u2019t understand the significance of their lines charged swiftly through them, it wasn\u2019t always easy to hear what they had to say.\n\nNonetheless, it definitely didn\u2019t look difficult teaching students the joys of dancing, singing, and moving together as a giant ensemble or chorus line. In fact, the choreography was so good, I had to ask who the choreographer was since he or she wasn\u2019t mentioned in the programme.\n\nNormally, students who want to become professional thespians go to a college or university to learn all the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of musical theatre, including set design, costuming, lighting, sound, and even makeup artistry.",

        "body": "Adam Masava and Andew \u2018Crae\u2019 Chege are like birds of a feather despite their coming from very different backgrounds.\n\nOne comes from a comfortable Christian home outside Ruiru, Kiambu. The other was born and raised in Mukuru, a part of town not nearly so secure as Crae\u2019s. Yet the two are united in their love of art which transcends the material differences of class and culture, race and tribe, and even gender and age.\n\nCrae and Adam met at one exhibition opening. Crae started spending time at Mukuru Art with Adam, even as he was nearly finished being a fourth year student in the Fine Art department at Kenyatta University (KU).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I got my Bachelor [of Arts from KU], but I\u2019ve learned so much from Adam, especially about how to be a professional artist, stuff I wasn\u2019t taught at KU,\u201d Crae tells the BDLife.\n\nAnthony Chege\u2019s \u2018Desired Destiny\u2019 (left) and 'Boat analytical Transformation' at the Village Market rooftop gallery on June 15, 2024. Photo credit: Margaretta wa Gacheru | Nation Media Group\n\n\u201cKU took a more academic approach to art so I learned a lot about different materials and techniques of painting, but not about making art a professional career, which is invaluable stuff,\u201d he added.\n\nAdam himself wasn\u2019t at the Vibrant Hues exhibition at the Village Market rooftop since he had other shows popping up in various places around Europe. \u201cWe had been planning on having this exhibition for a long time, but when we were finally able to secure the gallery, we\u2019d still have to wait a year,\u201d Crea explained.\n\nBut Adam had mapped out his side of the exhibition well before he went overseas. Plus he had several of his most dedicated students looking after all aspects of the show, from surveillance and sakes to curatorial and administrative aspects of the exhibition. Several were even given a corner of the gallery to show their work.\n\nThere are several other things that Adam and Crea have in common. One is an attention to perspective and ways of enhancing different vantage points with different materials. Adam does it using different kinds of variegated cardboard to illustrate a more three dimensional view of Kibera\u2019s mabati rooftops, some in the foreground of the work, others behind crafted with a sort of flatter cardboard meant to be further background.\n\nCrae used to paint scenes in the slums somewhat similar to Masava\u2019s, only he didn\u2019t work with anything but acrylic on canvas, that is, until recently when he started painting on glass, or rather, the glass-like plastic called Plexiglas.\n\nBut not just one plate per painting. Let\u2019s talk about four plates per painting on which Crae paints on both sides of one plate. So for one painting, Crae uses four plates of flexiglass to create eight different paintings. It might be difficult to imagine how four plates of \u2018glass\u2019 can hang together well, particularly when the four are stacked and then sealed tight.\n\nIt\u2019s rather like what silkscreen artists do when they are printing several colours, one precisely on top of the other so that the finished picture is intact with the colours laid out just as the artist intended.\n\nCrae has half a wall filled with monochrome cityscapes that display his skill as a draftsman drawing assorted areas of Eastlands and urban life. So when we had gotten round to the far end of the show and saw his \u2018Desirable Destiny\u2019 we were taken aback. This was definitely a new Crae.",

        "body": "To extend last week\u2019s article on hedging, today, I highlight why certain non-financial firms (read: commodity exporters, importers) need to develop a corporate hedging policy. As more and more companies suffer the consequences of being unhedged, having such a policy is becoming vital. I highlight the three pillars in building one.\n\nThe first pillar is a clear articulation of the firm\u2019s hedging objectives. These should be directly tied to the company\u2019s broader financial goals such as stabilising cash flows, hedging against short-term commodity price increases, managing foreign exchange risks or \u201clocking-in\u201d profit margins.\n\nSecond pillar involves defining the who and what of the policy. Who is responsible for the hedging policy? Who is going to be responsible for ensuring that the company adheres to policy? Who is responsible for developing, implementing and managing the hedging policy and accompanying strategies and procedures? A hedge committee, chief accountant, risk manager, etc.?\n\nWho is responsible for selecting appropriate counterparties and/or derivatives brokers/clearing members and what criteria will be used to evaluate them? And who is responsible for continuous monitoring and risk reporting?\n\nWhat type of transactions will be permitted? Forwards, futures, swaps, options? What indices will be permitted i.e. Dubai/Oman crude oil, ICE Coffee Futures, Singapore jet fuel, etc.? What resources (manpower, risk management systems, commodity market data, etc.) will said individuals and/or teams need to properly carry out their responsibilities? For example, the effectiveness of risk management metrics, such as stress testing, is essential for assessing the degree of vulnerability of the business under extreme conditions like a pandemic.\n\nIf the market trends unfavourably against the hedged exposure and the derivative fails to fulfil its hedging requirements (that is, does not offset the anticipated losses of the hedged exposure) or the chosen structure proves faulty as highlighted in my previous article on KQ, the primary purpose of the hedge is undermined. This situation could result in increased risk and a higher utilisation of the company\u2019s credit lines.\n\nThe third pillar deals with the practical aspects of executing derivative trades or the why, when and how. When and how will existing positions be reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate given the company's risk tolerance, hedging policy and current market conditions? When and how will the various risks (market, credit, operational, regulatory) be measured and by whom? When and why will transactions be executed?\n\nHow often should the policy be reviewed and by whom? This is to guarantee that the company consistently aligns with its core hedging objectives and does not deviate from them.\n\nClearly there are a lot of issues to be explored when developing a hedging policy but by adhering to the three core pillars outlined above, companies can ensure that their use of derivatives is prudent, purposeful and perfectly tailored to their specific needs.\n\nA well-designed hedging plan will cut both risks and costs. Additionally, it allows management to focus on aspects of the firm in which it has a competitive edge by minimising risks that are not central to the core business.",

        "title": "Pop star Celine Dion chronicles her journey to stardom and declining health",
        "body": "There are few music pop stars in the world with the clout of Celine Dion. For more than three decades the Canadian singer has charmed the world with power ballads that are romantic signature tunes among the young and old, across the globe.\n\nThat is why her announcement in December 2022 that she was putting her career on hold after being diagnosed with Stiff Person\u2019s Syndrome (SPS) was greeted with shock and disbelief among adoring fans. The disease is a rare neurological disorder that affects one or two people in a million, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. It causes fluctuating muscle rigidity that can manifest in muscle spasms and falls.\n\nThe story of the 56-year-old superstar\u2019s battle against the condition is chronicled in the new documentary I Am Celine Dion which premiered on Prime Video on June 25, 2024.\n\n\u201cBefore I got hit by SPS my voice was the conductor of my life,\u201d she says with a smirk. \u201cI was following it, \u2018you lead the way, I\u2019ll follow you,\u2019\u201d she explains while gesturing as if to sing.\n\nThe film, directed by Irene Taylor, the Oscar nominated US filmmaker who admits that she hardly knew anything about Dion before this project, is an intimate portrayal of the singer, her family life and the rehabilitation from effects of her illness.\n\nIn a departure from the typical documentary format, the film relies exclusively on Dion to tell her own story, without accompanying talking heads. It traces her childhood love for music through grainy family home videos as she recalls signing in the kitchen at age 5 for her audience comprising her 13 brothers and sisters in a little town in Quebec.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be an international star and sing all my life,\u201d she states in one of those childhood videos.\n\nThat shy girl with a distinctly powerful voice has risen to become a global icon over the course of 27 albums, selling 250 million records, winning five Grammy Awards and two Academy Awards. But that extraordinary success has come against the background of severe health challenges going back further than her public announcement last year.\n\n\u201cSeventeen years ago, I started experiencing voice spasms. I woke up and had breakfast and after breakfast my voice started to go up,\u201d she reveals. \u201cWhen I try to breathe, my lungs are OK, it is what is in front of my lungs that is so rigid because of SPS.\u201d\n\nShe dealt with that condition by pumping a variety of medicines into her system, 280-290 milligrammes of valium a day, according to her, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic but I could have died,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI needed medicine to function. One more pill, two more pills, five more pills, too many pills.\u201d She had to explain to her fans why her shows were getting cancelled and also deal with rampant rumors about her gaunt appearance.\n\nThe most emotionally draining scene is when Dion experiences a full-body attack with her body jerking in spasms in the middle of a physio therapy session as the cameras roll. Apparently after watching the rough cut of the documentary, she was adamant that that portion be retained to show the debilitating effects of SPS.\n\nMusically, the story is interspersed with archival footage of an exuberant Dion performing on stage in stark contrast to her frail physical condition during the making of the documentary.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in control of what I love to do, I could record three songs a night,\u201d she states. When you come in studio and you record, it sounds great, but when you go on stage it sounds greater because there is no mistake on stage, because there is humanity, bonding, emotions and when you forget your words, you panic for a second and out of the blue they (audience) start to sing.\u201d\n\nHer humorous side comes across whether showing off her massive collection of shoes and stage costumes or her famous \u201cbeat it, Spiderman\u201d retort at the end of the video for the song Ashes from the action film Deadpool 2.\n\nCeline Dion uses the metaphor of a fruit as she takes stock of her relationship with her fanbase: \u201cI am like an apple tree and people are in line and they all leave with a basket of apples. My branches are starting to fall sometime and those branches are starting to produce a little less apples but it still has many people in line.\u201d Then she concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t want them to wait in line if I don\u2019t have apples for them.\u201d",

        "title": "HMRC withheld offshore tax avoidance figures for UK\u2019s wealthy during election",
        "body": "Tax officials are under pressure this weekend to publish estimated figures on offshore tax avoidance by some of the country\u2019s wealthiest individuals after withholding the information in a report published during the election campaign.\n\nIn June 2022, Lucy Frazer, then financial secretary to the Treasury, pledged that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) would publish figures on the offshore tax gap, but the release of the figures has been repeatedly delayed. An HMRC report published on 20 June this year \u2013 four weeks after the election was called \u2013 estimated the tax gap to be \u00a339.8bn for the 2022-23 tax year. The tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax that should be collected and what has actually been paid.\n\nA breakdown of the figures of \u201cnon-compliance by UK residents failing to declare their offshore income\u201d was withheld by HMRC. Officials concluded that this \u201cadditional breakdown of the tax gap should not be released within the election period\u201d in line with guidance for civil servants.\n\nElection guidance for civil servants says that statistical activities should \u201cavoid competition with parliamentary candidates for the attention of the public\u201d.\n\nThe decision to withhold the estimated figures has been challenged by the investigative thinktank TaxWatch. It says that if HMRC concluded it was too controversial to publish the offshore tax gap figures, the publication of the other tax gap figures should also have been delayed.\n\nClaire Aston, director of TaxWatch, said: \u201cThe main political parties pledged in their election manifestos to raise more revenue by closing the tax gap, and given that, these figures should not have been held back.\u201d\n\nHMRC has been under pressure to estimate the size of the tax gap after figures disclosed to the independent thinktank Tax Policy Associates by HMRC in September 2021 revealed that UK taxpayers held nearly \u00a3570bn in tax havens. Officials said at the time that they hadn\u2019t produced any estimates of the amount of foreign financial accounts that hadn\u2019t been properly disclosed.\n\nA common reporting standard approved by the OECD in 2014 now enables the automatic exchange of financial information between partner countries to combat tax evasion. The standard under which nearly all UK residents with overseas bank accounts have the balance and interest reported annually to HMRC has provided an invaluable resource of new information to officials.\n\nSteven Porter, head of tax disputes and investigations at the law firm Pinsent Masons, said he was doubtful that there would be a \u201cpot of gold\u201d from offshore tax avoidance after the introduction of tougher penalties and the publicising of voluntary disclosure facilities. Porter said: \u201cThey may be some individuals who have stubbornly got their head in the sand, but I think they are a dying breed.\u201d\n\nHe said there may be some \u201clegacy\u201d offshore tax avoidance schemes, but he expected most of those to have been identified by HMRC. The total estimated gross tax gap for individuals who completed self-assessment tax returns was about \u00a32bn, he said, and the offshore tax gap was likely to be a proportion of that and relatively low.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It points out that the revenue lost due to tax avoidance in 2022-23 was \u00a31.8bn, or 0.2% of total theoretical liability. It said in a briefing last month: \u201cAmbitious targets are to be applauded but our advice to politicians of all parties is not to spend the money before it\u2019s been collected.\u201d\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a strong track record in tackling offshore non-compliance. Since the launch of our No Safe Havens strategy in 2019, we have secured almost \u00a3700m from offshore initiatives.\u201d",
        "summary": "Tax officials are under pressure this weekend to publish estimated figures on offshore tax avoidance by some of the country\u2019s wealthiest individuals after withholding the information in a report published during the election campaign.\nThe tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax that should be collected and what has actually been paid.\nIt says that if HMRC concluded it was too controversial to publish the offshore tax gap figures, the publication of the other tax gap figures should also have been delayed.\nThe total estimated gross tax gap for individuals who completed self-assessment tax returns was about \u00a32bn, he said, and the offshore tax gap was likely to be a proportion of that and relatively low.\nIt points out that the revenue lost due to tax avoidance in 2022-23 was \u00a31.8bn, or 0.2% of total theoretical liability.",

        "body": "Mercy craned forward, took a deep breath and loaded another task on her computer. One after another, disturbing images and videos appeared on her screen. As a Meta content moderator working at an outsourced office in Nairobi, Mercy was expected to action one \u201cticket\u201d every 55 seconds during her 10-hour shift. This particular video was of a fatal car crash. Someone had filmed the scene and uploaded it to Facebook, where it had been flagged by a user. Mercy\u2019s job was to determine whether it had breached any of the company\u2019s guidelines that prohibit particularly violent or graphic content. She looked closer at the video as the person filming zoomed in on the crash. She began to recognise one of the faces on the screen just before it snapped into focus: the victim was her grandfather.\n\nMercy pushed her chair back and ran towards the exit, past rows of colleagues who looked on in concern. She was crying. Outside, she started calling relatives. There was disbelief \u2013 nobody else had heard the news yet. Her supervisor came out to comfort her, but also to remind her that she would need to return to her desk if she wanted to make her targets for the day. She could have a day off tomorrow in light of the incident \u2013 but given that she was already at work, he pointed out, she may as well finish her shift.\n\nNew tickets appeared on the screen: her grandfather again, the same crash over and over. Not only the same video shared by others, but new videos from different angles. Pictures of the car; pictures of the dead; descriptions of the scene. She began to recognise everything now. Her neighbourhood, around sunset, only a couple of hours ago \u2013 a familiar street she had walked along many times. Four people had died. Her shift seemed endless.\n\nWe spoke with dozens of workers just like Mercy at three data annotation and content moderation centres run by one company across Kenya and Uganda. Content moderators are the workers who trawl, manually, through social media posts to remove toxic content and flag violations of the company\u2019s policies. Data annotators label data with relevant tags to make it legible for use by computer algorithms. Behind the scenes, these two types of \u201cdata work\u201d make our digital lives possible. Mercy\u2019s story was a particularly upsetting case, but by no means extraordinary. The demands of the job are intense.\n\nModerators witness suicides, torture and rape \u2018almost every day \u2026 you normalise things that are just not normal\u2019\n\n\u201cPhysically you are tired, mentally you are tired, you are like a walking zombie,\u201d said one data worker who had migrated from Nigeria for the job. Shifts are long and workers are expected to meet stringent performance targets based on their speed and accuracy. Mercy\u2019s job also requires close attention \u2013 content moderators can\u2019t just zone out, because they have to correctly tag videos according to strict criteria. Videos need to be examined to find the highest violation as defined by Meta\u2019s policies. Violence and incitement, for instance, are a higher violation than simple bullying and harassment \u2013 so it isn\u2019t enough to identify a single violation and then stop. You have to watch the whole thing, in case it gets worse.\n\n\u201cThe most disturbing thing was not just the violence,\u201d another moderator told us, \u201cit was the sexually explicit and disturbing content.\u201d Moderators witness suicides, torture and rape \u201calmost every day\u201d, commented the same moderator; \u201cyou normalise things that are just not normal.\u201d Workers in these moderation centres are continually bombarded with graphic images and videos, and given no time to process what they are witnessing. They\u2019re expected to action between 500 and 1,000 tickets a day. Many reported never feeling the same again: the job had made an indelible mark on their lives. The consequences can be devastating. \u201cMost of us are damaged psychologically, some have attempted suicide \u2026 some of our spouses have left us and we can\u2019t get them back,\u201d commented one moderator who had been let go by the company.\n\n\u201cThe company policies were even more strenuous than the job itself,\u201d remarked another. Workers at one of the content moderation centres we visited were left crying and shaking after witnessing beheading videos, and were told by management that at some point during the week they could have a 30-minute break to see a \u201cwellness counsellor\u201d \u2013 a colleague who had no formal training as a psychologist. Workers who ran away from their desks in response to what they\u2019d seen were told they had committed a violation of the company\u2019s policy because they hadn\u2019t remembered to enter the right code on their computer indicating they were either \u201cidle\u201d or on a \u201cbathroom break\u201d \u2013 meaning their productivity scores could be marked down accordingly. The stories were endless: \u201cI collapsed in the office\u201d; \u201cI went into a severe depression\u201d; \u201cI had to go to hospital\u201d; \u201cthey had no concern for our wellbeing\u201d. Workers told us that management was understood to monitor hospital records to verify whether an employee had taken a legitimate sick day \u2013 but never to wish them better, or out of genuine concern for their health.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018By using AI products we are directly inserting ourselves into the lives of workers dispersed across the globe.\u2019 Photograph: Frank Nowikowski/Alamy\n\nJob security at this particular company is minimal \u2013 the majority of workers we interviewed were on rolling one- or three-month contracts, which could disappear as soon as the client\u2019s work was complete. They worked in rows of up to a hundred on production floors in a darkened building, part of a giant business park on the outskirts of Nairobi. Their employer was a client of Meta\u2019s, a prominent business process outsourcing (BPO) company with headquarters in San Francisco and delivery centres in east Africa where insecure and low-income work could be distributed to local employees of the firm. Many of the workers, like Mercy herself, had once lived in the nearby Kibera slum \u2013 the largest urban slum in Africa \u2013 and were hired under the premise that the company was helping disadvantaged workers into formal employment. The reality is that many of these workers are too terrified to question management for fear of losing their jobs. Workers reported that those who complain are told to shut up and reminded that they could easily be replaced.\n\nWhile many of the moderators we spoke to were Kenyan, some had migrated from other African countries to work for the BPO and assist Meta in moderating other African languages. A number of these workers spoke about being identifiable on the street as foreigners, which added to their sense of being vulnerable to harassment and abuse from the Kenyan police. Police harassment wasn\u2019t the only danger they faced. One woman we interviewed described how members of a \u201cliberation front\u201d in a neighbouring African country found names and pictures of Meta moderators and posted them online with menacing threats, because they disagreed with moderation decisions that had been made. These workers were terrified, of course, and went to the BPO with the pictures. The company informed them they would see about enhancing security at the production facilities; aside from that, they said, there was nothing else they could do \u2013 the workers should just \u201cstay safe\u201d.\n\nMost of us can hope never to experience the inhumane working conditions endured by Mercy and her colleagues. But data work of this kind is performed by millions of workers in different circumstances and locations around the world. At this particular centre, some of the working conditions changed after our research was conducted. However large companies such as Meta tend to have multiple outsourced providers of moderation services who compete for the most profitable contracts from the company. This data work is essential for the functioning of the everyday products and services we use \u2013 from social media apps to chatbots and new automated technologies. It\u2019s a precondition for their very existence \u2013 were it not for content moderators constantly scanning posts in the background, social networks would be immediately flooded with violent and explicit material. Without data annotators creating datasets that can teach AI the difference between a traffic light and a street sign, autonomous vehicles would not be allowed on our roads. And without workers training machine learning algorithms, we would not have AI tools such as ChatGPT.\n\nOne such worker we spoke to, Anita, worked for a BPO in Gulu, the largest city in northern Uganda. Anita has been working on a project for an autonomous vehicle company. Her job is to review hour after hour of footage of drivers at the wheel. She\u2019s looking for any visual evidence of a lapse in concentration, or something resembling a \u201csleep state\u201d. This assists the manufacturer in constructing an \u201cin-cabin behaviour monitoring system\u201d based on the driver\u2019s facial expressions and eye movements. Sitting at a computer and concentrating on this footage for hours at a time is draining. Sometimes, Anita feels the boredom as a physical force, pushing her down in her chair and closing her eyelids. But she has to stay alert, just like the drivers on her screen. In return for 45 hours of intense, stressful work a week \u2013 possibly with unpaid overtime on top \u2013 annotators can expect to earn in the region of 800,000 Ugandan shillings a month, a little over US$200 or approximately $1.16 per hour.\n\nOn the production floor, hundreds of data annotators sit in silence, lined up at rows of desks. The setup will be instantly familiar to anyone who\u2019s worked at a call centre \u2013 the system of management is much the same. The light is dimmed in an attempt to reduce the eye strain that results from nine hours of intense concentration. The workers\u2019 screens flicker with a constant stream of images and videos requiring annotation. Like Anita, workers are trained to identify elements of the image in response to client specifications: they may, for example, draw polygons around different objects, from traffic lights to stop signs and human faces.\n\nView image in fullscreen The countryside near Gulu, Uganda: content moderators are often fleeing rural poverty or urban slums. Photograph: Alan Gignoux/Alamy\n\nEvery aspect of Anita and her fellow annotators\u2019 working lives is digitally monitored and recorded. From the moment they use the biometric scanners to enter the secure facilities, to the extensive network of CCTV cameras, workers are closely surveilled. Every second of their shift must be accounted for according to the efficiency-monitoring software on their computer. Some workers we spoke to even believe managers cultivate a network of informers among the staff to make sure that attempts to form a trade union don\u2019t sneak under the radar.\n\nWorking constantly, for hours on end, is physically and psychologically draining. It offers little opportunity for self-direction; the tasks are reduced to their simplest form to maximise the efficiency and productivity of the workers. Annotators are disciplined into performing the same routine actions over and over again at top speed. As a result, they experience a curious combination of complete boredom and suffocating anxiety at the same time. This is the reality at the coalface of the AI revolution: people working under oppressive surveillance at furious intensity just to keep their jobs and support their families.\n\nBy using AI products we are directly inserting ourselves into the lives of workers dispersed across the globe\n\nWhen we think about the world of AI development our minds might naturally turn to engineers working in sleek, air-conditioned offices in Silicon Valley. What most people don\u2019t realise is that roughly 80% of the time spent on training AI consists of annotating datasets. Frontier technologies such as autonomous vehicles, machines for nanosurgery and drones are all being developed in places like Gulu. As tech commentator Phil Jones puts it: \u201cIn reality, the magic of machine learning is the grind of data labelling.\u201d This is where the really time-consuming and laborious work takes place. There is a booming global marketplace for data annotation, which was estimated to be worth $2.22bn in 2022 and is expected to grow at around 30% each year until it reaches over $17bn in 2030. As AI tools are taken up in retail, healthcare and manufacturing \u2013 to name just a few sectors that are being transformed \u2013 the demand for well-curated data will increase by the day.\n\nView image in fullscreen The majority of workers in the global south work in the informal jobs sector. Photograph: Yannick Tylle/Getty Images\n\nToday\u2019s tech companies can use their wealth and power to exploit a deep division in how the digital labour of AI work is distributed across the globe. The majority of workers in countries in the global south work in the informal sector. Unemployment rates remain staggeringly high and well-paid jobs with employment protections remain elusive for many. Vulnerable workers in these contexts are not only likely to work for lower wages; they will also be less ready to demand better working conditions, because they know how easily they can be replaced. The process of outsourcing work to the global south is popular with businesses not because it provides much-needed economic opportunities for the less well off, but because it provides a clear route to a more tightly disciplined workforce, higher efficiency and lower costs.\n\nBy using AI products we are directly inserting ourselves into the lives of workers dispersed across the globe. We are connected whether we like it or not. Just as drinking a cup of coffee implicates the coffee drinker in a global production network from bean to cup, we should all understand how using a search engine, a chatbot \u2013 or even something as simple as a smart robot vacuum \u2013 sets in motion global flows of data and capital that connect workers, organisations and consumers in every corner of the planet.\n\nMany tech companies therefore do what they can to hide the reality of how their products are actually made. They present a vision of shining, sleek, autonomous machines \u2013 computers searching through large quantities of data, teaching themselves as they go \u2013 rather than the reality of the poorly paid and gruelling human labour that both trains them and is managed by them.\n\nBack in Gulu, Anita has just arrived home from work. She sits outside with her children in plastic chairs under her mango tree. She\u2019s tired. Her eyes start to close as the sun falls below the horizon. The children go to bed, and she will not be long after them. She needs to rest before her 5am start tomorrow, when she will be annotating again.\n\nNobody ever leaves the BPO willingly \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else to do. She sees her ex-colleagues when she\u2019s on her way to work, hawking vegetables on the market or trying to sell popcorn by the side of the road. If there were other opportunities, people would seize them. She just has to keep her head down, hit her targets, and make sure that whatever happens, she doesn\u2019t get laid off. Maybe another project will come in; maybe she could change to a new workflow. That would be a relief, something a bit different. Maybe labelling streets, drawing outlines around signs and trying to work out what it would be like to live at the other end of the lens, in a country with big illuminated petrol signs and green grass lawns.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Feeding the Machine: The Hidden Human Labour Powering AI, by James Muldoon, Mark Graham and Callum Cant (Canongate \u00a320).

        "body": "If Jonathan Reynolds was expecting a honeymoon period as the new business secretary, a glance at the mounting list of issues that require his attention will quash that idea. From a potential renationalisation to angry steelworkers and posties, Reynolds has an overflowing in-tray.\n\nSo acute are some of the problems that Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray, prepared an internal dossier, described as \u201cSue\u2019s shit list\u201d by some, which included the potential collapse of Thames Water among other issues including failing councils and prison overcrowding. Here, we examine some of Reynolds\u2019s most pressing priorities.\n\nTata Steel\u2019s job losses\n\nReynolds is expected to meet executives from Indian-owned Tata Steel as early as Monday. In an awkward twist of timing, the first of two blast furnace closures at its vast Port Talbot steelworks took place on Friday, with the second due in September \u2013 after strike action was narrowly avoided \u2013 putting 2,800 jobs under threat.\n\nTata hopes Labour will honour a \u00a3500m subsidy, part of \u00a33bn pledged to the industry, raising hopes that jobs can be protected as a new electric arc furnace is built on the site, to be finished in 2027.\n\nChris Rowley, an emeritus professor at Bayes business school, is not optimistic. \u201cThe recent threat of strike action ended maybe because of a belief and hope that the election of Labour will persuade the owners to keep a furnace operating until the future one is actually built,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSadly, without the new government offering serious amounts of new money, it seems more likely that the best the talks will result in is shifting deckchairs on the deck.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Labour has been briefed on the peril faced by another industrial stalwart, the Short Brothers factory in Belfast, which is caught up in the fallout from Boeing\u2019s $4.7bn takeover of Short\u2019s owner, Spirit Aerosystems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Thaes Water is labouring under more than \u00a315bn of debt. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nThames Water\u2019s troubles\n\nBy calling a surprise July election, Rishi Sunak has inadvertently ensured that the unfolding troubles at Thames Water \u2013 and its potential temporary nationalisation \u2013 will receive significant focus during Labour\u2019s first week.\n\nInvestors and executives had been keenly awaiting a draft view on water companies\u2019 five-year business plans from the industry regulator, Ofwat, in June but its price-review announcement was delayed by the election and will now take place on Thursday.\n\nThe review will indicate by how much Thames will be allowed to raise bills, and whether its \u00a319.7bn investment plan, intended in part to fix leaky pipes and prevent sewage spills, will be approved.\n\nBefore that, Thames will announce its annual results on Tuesday, laying bare the state of its tattered finances. Its chief executive, Chris Weston, may face questions over the board\u2019s handling of the situation, after the Guardian revealed that it had approved a \u00a3150m dividend just hours before announcing that shareholders had U-turned on \u00a3500m of pledged funding.\n\nLabour could soon be forced to decide whether to temporarily nationalise Britain\u2019s biggest water company, which is creaking under \u00a315.6bn of debt, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse. Reynolds has said there \u201cshould be a solution\u201d that avoids nationalisation, without specifying what \u2013 although it could involve a mixture of public and private money.\n\nRoyal Mail takeover\n\nLabour has appeared relatively passive about the news that the biggest shareholder in Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, the Czech billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, is planning to take the 508-year-old postal group private.\n\nInternational Distributions Services\u2019 board recommended shareholders accept the 370p offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group, just weeks after saying that his original 320p offer significantly undervalued the group. The \u00a33.57bn bid \u00adrepresents a premium to the price before the takeover interest emerged, and to the 330p the group was privatised at in 2013, but is far lower than highs witnessed during the pandemic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The regulator is due to update on its work later this summer. Moreover, the takeover would have to clear national security checks \u2013 a process K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd has successfully ridden out before. He has also faced scrutiny over his business links raised in a Guardian investigation. The deal is also expected to load \u00a32.9bn of fresh debt, on top of \u00a32bn of existing loans, on to the company.\n\nReynolds will be under pressure to show the government has carefully considered the deal before allowing it to proceed.\n\nView image in fullscreen Royal Mail\u2019s parent company is the subject of a \u00a33.5bn bid. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy\n\nShein\u2019s \u00a350bn listing\n\nDonald Tang, the executive chairman of the China-founded online fashion retailer, could be in the UK this week as the company prepares to list in London. Its executives have already met Labour MPs and received an indication of support for its listing, stating that \u201craising investment\u201d is among its \u201cmissions for government\u201d.\n\nHowever, the flotation has faced strong headwinds: from questions over Shein\u2019s valuation and alleged labour malpractices to an EU plan to impose import duty on cheap goods. Shein pursued a London \u00adlisting after ambitions for a US listing were seemingly frustrated by US legislators.\n\nReynolds will need to make it clear that Labour will not simply wave any listing through, while at the same time the City fights to \u00adprotect its status on the world financial stage in the face of an exodus of stock-market big names.\n\nIndustrial action\n\nLabour\u2019s traditional union-friendly stance could point to some \u00adresolution in long-running public sector pay disputes. A standoff in the rail industry has dragged on for more than two years, with train drivers in the Aslef union the remaining holdouts. While there are no immediate strikes planned, further action could be called unless there is a swift resolution.\n\nSeparately, the president of the TUC, Matt Wrack, has called for a summit with unions in the next few days to ensure Labour moves quickly to improve workers\u2019 rights.",

A Labour source told PoliticsHome earlier this year: \u201cWhile there\u2019s still much work to be done to win a general election, we owe it to the public to ensure we\u2019re prepared to govern, given we\u2019d inherit a complete mess from the Tories. Leaning on the expertise of those who have been at the heart of government is an important part of that work.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And within months, it was clear to all of us on the Conservative [benches that] whenever Labour got its act together \u2026 to a point where it was poised to return to government, Rachel Reeves would be close to the very top of it.\n\nLaunching one of the most radical shake-ups for planning regulation in decades could prove politically risky for Labour, with the changes likely to pave the way for construction projects that could prove locally unpopular.\n\nSuccessive governments have struggled to make changes amid stiff opposition. However, the party hopes that by moving early in his premiership, fresh from a landslide victory, and building a broader base of political support, Starmer can give the shake-up more chance of making progress.\n\nIt is also expected to take time for changes in regulations to have an impact on construction, adding to the urgency of the changes should Labour want to be able to point to a track record of housing delivery come the next general election in 2029.\n\nIn its manifesto Labour said it would make changes to forge ahead with new roads, railways, reservoirs, and other nationally significant infrastructure. It would also set out new national policy statements to prioritise construction projects.",

Hermer was among a group of Jewish lawyers, including former president of the UK supreme court Lord Neuberger, to write a letter warning that international law must guide Israel\u2019s response to Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack.\n\nThe letter stated that Hamas\u2019s actions \u201cwere not simply a moral outrage but an egregious violation of all norms of international law\u201d.\n\nIt said that Israel had a clear right in international law to respond in self-defence and a duty to defend its citizens, but added: \u201cTo be clear, collective punishment is prohibited by the laws of war. Equally, international law requires combatants to ensure minimum destruction to civilian life and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAdam Wagner, a human rights lawyer who co-signed the letter with Hermer, described him as \u201can international law expert [who] has lived and breathed human rights law since the Human Rights Act arrived\u201d.\n\nSir Jonathan Jones, the former Treasury solicitor and permanent secretary of the government legal department, described it as an \u00ad\u201cexcellent appointment\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Patrick Vallance, who was one of the government\u2019s most senior advisers during the Covid pandemic, is the new science minister.

I have no doubt he will take very seriously the attorney general\u2019s vital role of upholding the rule of law in government.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hermer\u2019s arrival has meant sidelining Emily Thornberry, the London Labour MP who had held the role in opposition.\n\nStarmer\u2019s allies believe that appointments to a \u201cgovernment of all the talents\u201d, or \u201cgoats\u201d, will demonstrate that the prime minister intends to lead in a non-ideological way.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lord Jones later complained that being a junior minister had been \u201cone of the most dehumanising and depersonalising experiences a human being can have\u201d.\n\nOthers caused political embarrassment for the government. However, Lord Darzi stayed in post as a health minister for two years, while his review of the NHS won broad support.\n\nIn other appointments announced on Saturday, Ellie Reeves, the sister of Rachel Reeves, was made a Cabinet Office minister and replaced Anneliese Dodds as party chair.\n\nDan Jarvis became a Home Office minister, and Jim McMahon and Matthew Pennycook were made ministers in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Douglas Alexander, meanwhile, was made a business minister.",

        "body": "Standing in front of a Soviet-era industrial elevator, ready to descend 2,000ft for a gruelling six-hour shift at a coalmine in eastern Ukraine, Ludmyla Vashkatova looked unfazed.\n\nThe last thing she saw before stepping into the metal cage and plunging into darkness with dozens of other miners was a towering sign urging workers to take care. \u201cYou are awaited at home,\u201d it read, a stark reminder of the perils working at a frontline mine in the heavily shelled city of Pokrovsk.\n\n\u201cAt first, going underground was scary, but you soon get used to it,\u201d said Vashkatova, 49, as bare-chested workers emerging from the night shift, their faces darkened by coal dust and their bodies drenched in sweat, passed by her.\n\nVladimir Putin\u2019s invasion, which saw hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men serve at the front, has pushed women like Vashkatova down into the mines, taking up traditionally male jobs to keep the country\u2019s economy going.\n\nNearly three-quarters of Ukrainian employers have complained of workforce shortages, according to a recent study, and in Kyiv intervals between metro trains have increased due to a worker shortage, with up to 10% of the workforce mobilised. Nationwide, there is a 30% deficiency in bus drivers.\n\nA former village school teacher in the eastern Donetsk region, Vashkatova lost her job last year when relentless Russian shelling forced her pupils to turn to online schooling.\n\nWhile scrolling online, she saw an ad on Facebook from Ukraine\u2019s largest steelmaker, Metinvest, for a job at the Pokrovsk mine, seeking workers to operate machines underground.\n\n\u201cThe pay is good and stable,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is quite rare these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a teacher but now I am a student again. It is an interesting process,\u201d Vashkatova said, adding that she had a few weeks left of training before she could operate the machinery unsupervised.\n\nTo enable women to work underground, the Ukrainian government lifted a law that had previously prohibited women from working in \u201charmful or dangerous\u201d conditions.\n\nView image in fullscreen Violetta Loevska, right, says she sees it as her duty to keep the mine running after her uncle was sent to the front. Photograph: J\u0119drzej Nowicki/The Guardian\n\nSome have taken the opportunity with open hands as jobs in the battle-ravished region dried up.\n\nAmid the rumble of rail carts and hum of machinery in the dark and dusty labyrinthine network of tunnels, Marina Vykhrevna, 50, stood alongside a group of male workers inside the mine.\n\nHaving spent three decades working at a mine above ground sorting dry coal, she welcomed the opportunity the war gave her to train as a quality control inspector underground.\n\nHer salary had doubled to 19,000 (\u00a3360), and with the influx of women, a bond of camaraderie had formed. \u201cI think it\u2019s great more women join. The girls are supporting each other,\u201d Vykhrevna said.\n\nShe added that her female friends were initially surprised when she told them about her job, but have since inquired about available positions.\n\nUkraine has the world\u2019s sixth-largest coal reserve, with 90% of it located in the Donbas region, where mining has long been the lifeline for many towns and cities.\n\nNearly everyone at the mine in Pokrovsk, a city with a prewar population of about 61,000, has a relative who was fighting to defend the country.\n\nVioletta Loevska, 21, who recently started working at the mine measuring methane levels, said she saw it as her \u201cduty\u201d to keep it operating, especially since her uncle who worked at the mine had been sent to the front.\n\n\u201cEveryone understands that there just aren\u2019t enough men left. If we don\u2019t work here, who will?\u201d she said as she walked down a tunnel.\n\nDown in the mine, Loevska stressed, gender did not matter, dismissing the notion of lingering stigma surrounding taking on traditionally male roles.\n\n\u201cI knew very well what I was signing up for. Women can do the job just as well as men. All that matters is keeping other miners safe.\u201d\n\nBlue-collar industries heavily dominated by sturdy working-age men, such as mining, transport and construction are disproportionately affected by mobilisation. These vital sectors are expected to face further workforce depletion after president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s decision to lower the conscription age to 26.\n\nBut in the east, shortages are especially acute, with many families fleeing abroad or to the relative safety of western Ukraine.\n\nSince the start of the war, 915 out of 6,578 male workers at Metinvest\u2019s Pokrovsk mine have joined the armed forces, while others have left the region, said Serhiy Stepanenko, the head of the mine\u2019s human resources department.\n\nStepanenko said that about 30 women have so far taken up jobs underground, while some women have started working in traditionally male-dominated roles in logistics and transportation.\n\nView image in fullscreen Women such as Tetiana Lishchenko are learning to drive a truck, which was a male-dominated role. Photograph: J\u0119drzej Nowicki/The Guardian\n\nBut he said many of the most physically demanding positions would remain closed off to women. \u201cThe worker\u2019s deficit is problematic and female employment won\u2019t fix it,\u201d Stepanenko said, adding that the mine has been forced to change the production outlook this year based on the available personnel.\n\nBeyond the numerous usual hazards and long-term health risks of working in a Soviet-era coalmine \u2013 an industry plagued by deadly accidents \u2013 miners in Pokrovsk also face the threat of constant Russian bombardment. The mine is located just 15 miles from the battlefield, and Russian forces have been slowly creeping closer to Pokrovsk in recent weeks.\n\nThree days after the Guardian descended into the Pokrovsk mine, Russia shelled another site in the nearby city of Selydove, setting several production facilities on fire. The attack cut electricity at the mine, trapping 53 miners for hours before they were evacuated.\n\n\u201cOf course we worry about the fighting. All we can do is follow the safety protocols as best as we can,\u201d said Loevska.\n\nBut the shortage of men is felt far beyond the frontlines, where the constant noise of rocket alarms and artillery shells has become a fixture in daily life.\n\nTo tackle some of these challenges, the Ukrainian government and independent organisations have set up fast-track retraining programmes for female workers across the country.\n\nOn a recent morning on the outskirts of Kyiv, a group of women gathered for a truck driving course organised by the NGO Reskilling.\n\n\u201cTruck driving was traditionally a male profession, but I have always wanted to experience what it\u2019s like to be behind the wheel of such a powerful machine,\u201d said Valentyna Kaistreno, who lived in Mariupol before Russia occupied the city, as she stepped outside a giant truck.\n\nKaistreno noted that for a long time, women were expected to stay at home and take care of their children.\n\n\u201cBut now, the situation in the country has changed, and attitudes are evolving too.\u201d",

        "body": "Australian owners of Tesla batteries could miss out on lucrative revenue streams because the US energy giant restricts the devices\u2019 ability to interact locally with third parties and authorities continue to dither over setting and enforcing standards.\n\nAn increasing number of products from air conditioners to hot water heaters and solar panels can be controlled remotely, and consumers can sign deals rewarding them for altering power usage during peak load periods, including supplying electricity to grid.\n\nTesla is required in many US states to enable so-called interoperability of batteries. However, the company disables that capability in its main storage product \u2013 the $15,000 Powerwall 2 battery \u2013 it sells to Australians, industry participants say.\n\nThey say federal and state governments should impose US mandates on Tesla and other battery suppliers according to an international standard \u2013 IEEE1547-2018 Clause 10 \u2013 to maximise future benefits to consumers and the grid, and firms restricting utility should be excluded from rebates, such as New South Wales\u2019 subsidy program of as much as $2,400 a battery.\n\n\u201cBatteries that do not offer their full performance via an open standards-based, non-cloud control port are too easily locked into a particular business model to the detriment of their owners,\u201d said Dean Spaccavento, the chief executive of Reposit Power.\n\nGovernments should specify and enforce a local control interface for any battery installed as part of their rebate programs, he said. Spaccavento said his firm does not bundle Tesla batteries into its services because of the US company\u2019s stance.\n\nGuardian Australia has sought comment from Tesla.\n\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator highlighted the potential for coordinated consumer energy resource (CER) storage in its grid blueprint released last week.\n\nFrom about 200 megawatts now, such storage will rise to 37 gigawatts by 2049-50, or two-thirds of the entire storage in the national electricity market. Without \u201ceffective orchestration of consumer batteries\u201d, the grid would need about $4.1bn in extra investment, Aemo\u2019s integrated system plan said.\n\n\u201cAs all batteries [Tesla] sell here are connected to their cloud, it is literally a remote software command that could switch the capability back on,\u201d an industry veteran said.\n\nIf the battery only has \u201ccloud control\u201d, devices that could be orchestrated will instead \u201cfight each other\u201d to the financial detriment of its owners and nullify its potential benefits for grid stability and other services, the veteran said. Authorities have had eight years to come up with appropriate standards.\n\nA spokesperson for Aemo said CER coordination and control was \u201ccritical to a least-cost transition\u201d, and \u201ccan only be achieved with effective interoperability\u201d of such assets as home batteries.\n\nThere is no requirement in Australia for Tesla to allow local third-party access, like in the US, they said. \u201cA number of processes\u201d were under way to review technical standards, access issues and consumer protections, they added.\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it was up to governments to impose interoperability or access obligations on battery suppliers.\n\n\u201cAny restrictions on access or product interoperability would only raise concerns under the Competition and Consumer Act where those restrictions lead to a substantially lessening of competition,\u201d they said.\n\nRichie Merzian, the acting chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, said \u201cconsumer energy in Australia has long been viewed by energy retailers as a problem to be managed rather than an opportunity to be embraced\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Australia has a huge take-up of consumer energy products but very little thought, regulation or resourcing has come with this,\u201d Merzian said. \u201cA gradual phase-in of interoperability capabilities into the Australian product set will mean huge new benefits that people could only have dreamed of just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nCon Hristodoulidis, a policy director at Clean Energy Council, noted standards for the interoperability of consumer resources would hinge on a final report from the federal government.\n\n\u201cIt is important that households are empowered to make the right choice of home batteries and have greater flexibility to select service providers without experiencing higher software and hardware costs in so doing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said: \u201cConsumer energy resources, including things like home batteries, will play an important role in Australia\u2019s energy transformation towards 82% renewables by 2030.\u201d\n\nHe said state and energy ministers were committed to reforming the National Consumer Energy Resources Roadmap to allow consumers to export more solar power to the grid and deliver nationally consistent standards in key areas, including vehicle to grid technologies.\n\nA spokesperson for NSW\u2019s energy department said it was engaging with industry stakeholders, including battery manufacturers, and \u201ccontinuing to finalise the details of the peak demand reduction scheme to ensure it delivers the best possible outcomes for all participants\u201d.",

        "body": "Hackers claimed this week that they had obtained barcode data for hundreds of thousands of tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour, demanding that Ticketmaster pay millions in ransom money or they would leak the information online.\n\nThe hacking group posted samples of the data to an online forum\u2013 ticket data on Swift\u2019s shows in Indianapolis, Miami, and New Orleans \u2013 and alleged it possessed an additional 30m million barcodes for other high-profile concerts and sporting events.\n\nThe ransom posts on the online forum were from the hacking group ShinyHunters, and an account that appeared to be associated with it called Sp1d3rHunters. The group has a history of claiming responsibility for major hacks against companies including Santander bank, AT&T, Microsoft and others.\n\nTicketmaster denied offering any money to the hackers, who had not engaged with the company about the ransom, according to a statement from parent Live National Entertainment. Ticketmaster also stated that its ticketing technology prevented such leaked barcodes from being used as tickets by refreshing barcodes every few seconds.\n\nHopeful Swifties probably won\u2019t be able to attend their icon\u2019s world tour with an ill-gotten ticket. Although the data appeared to be from the hacking group\u2019s large scale breach of Ticketmaster and Live Nation earlier this year, cybersecurity experts who examined the leak agreed that the stolen data would not be useful for gaining access to an arena. The data could not be used as a ticket because the Ticketmaster mobile application uses dynamic barcodes, experts said, whereas the data in the hack is static.\n\n\u201cThis data is almost certainly not sufficient to allow someone to recreate a barcode to get in,\u201d said Don Smith, vice-president at the cybersecurity firm Secureworks. \u201cIf you\u2019re running events of the size and scale of the Eras tour, you are not going to make it easy for someone to just get access to a database and then be able to create a fake ticket.\u201d\n\nDespite ShinyHunters\u2019 ability to gain access to the Swift ticketing data, which included information on tickets for nine upcoming dates across the three US cities, experts said that companies such as Live Nation have more sophisticated measures to prevent that data from being used to actually steal tickets.\n\n\u201cIf the thought here was that you\u2019re going to create absolute chaos on all future Eras tour dates, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe ransom threat to Live Nation is part of a broader rise in cyberattacks and ransomware in recent years. The attacks have targeted major corporations and public institutions, with analysts estimating that victims paid out $1.1bn in ransoms in 2023. The United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service is still reeling from a devastating attack by a Russia-based ransomware gang in June.\n\nEarlier this year, ShinyHunters allegedly breached a third party contractor to gain access to Ticketmaster\u2019s data that included the names, partial payment details, phone numbers, ticket sales and other information on around 560 million customers. LiveNation confirmed the hack in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in May after ShinyHunters took credit for the attack.\n\nThe hack added to Live Nation\u2019s myriad of public relations problems and legal woes. The US Department of Justice sued the company in May, alleging it was illegally monopolizing ticket sales and seeking to break it up. Live Nation also faced widespread backlash over its handling of Swift\u2019s Eras tour, with a botched sales process leading to hours-long waits, failure to handle consumer demand and tickets going on resale for exorbitant amounts. Swift herself has bashed the company repeatedly.\n\nSwift\u2019s tour has been the target of cyberattacks before. In February, hackers breached Australian events company Ticketek, breaking into individual accounts and reselling Eras tour tickets. The company set up pop-up stands outside Swift\u2019s shows for fans to report their concerns and potentially regain their tickets.\n\nShinyHunters has also claimed responsibility for accessing bank and credit card numbers for around 30 million customers and employees at Santander bank earlier this year. The group attempted to sell that information to the highest bidder. In May, the FBI and US Department of Justice seized the online forum that ShinyHunters used to post information and ransom threats from its Live Nation and Santander hacks, but another site quickly popped up.",

        "body": "On social media videos, audiences throw packs of tissues around the cinema halls. Tearful TikToks from across Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore show friends leaving the cinema weeping. Thailand\u2019s latest hit film, How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies, has reduced audiences across south-east Asia to tears \u2013 and broken box office records.\n\nThe film, about a university dropout who offers to care for his terminally ill grandma, hoping to inherit her house, has reportedly earned 334m Thai baht ($9.1m) at the Thai box office and become the most successful Thai film ever in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.\n\nIt is the latest success story for films made in Thailand and south-east Asia, which, while Hollywood has grappled with strikes and production delays, have captured audiences across the region and boosted the cinema industry.\n\n\u201cCovid, and industry issues that impacted Hollywood product flow, have ushered [in] a period of growth for local and regional films, in some cases with record-breaking results,\u201d said Rance Pow, of Artisan Gateway, a film consultancy.\n\nIn Indonesia, the horror film KKN di Desa Penari (KKN in Dancer\u2019s Village) sold more than 10m tickets in 2022, according to local media, becoming the country\u2019s highest-grossing locally made film. The Vietnamese romance Mai, released in February, has become the highest-grossing Vietnam-produced film of all time at home and in North America and Europe, according to Deadline.\n\nA scene from KKN di Desa Penari, which became Indonesia\u2019s highest-grossing locally made film. Photograph: handout\n\nWhile screens are being closed down in the US, Indonesia\u2019s biggest chain, Cinema XXI, listed on the Indonesian stock exchange last year, while in Thailand new cinemas are being opened.\n\nRecent Thai successes were not necessarily made with large production budgets, nor did they receive government help prior to their release, said Dr Unaloam Chanrungmaneekul, an associate professor at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. But they resonated with audiences because they were rooted in local culture and dealt with contemporary social issues, including the gap between generations.\n\n\u201cThey present a mix between comedy, fantasy and social realism \u2026. They show satirical scenes about Thai culture, politics, belief, and challenge Thai norms,\u201d she said.\n\nHow to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies explores the dynamics within a Thai Chinese family: the unequal treatment of sons and daughters, the gulf between young and old, the fading away of traditions and language.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they [achieved] huge success in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, and also maybe other countries [with Chinese populations] \u2026 The cultural identity [of the films] is very deep and very clear,\u201d Unaloam said.\n\nWaritsara Panacharoensawad, 30, who reviews films on her social media channels as Aquabbiew, was among many who shared their tearful response to the movie online.\n\nShe saw parallels between the film and the experience in her own family, where her grandmother was cared for by her and her mother, and was moved by its nostalgic setting \u2013 scenes of grandma\u2019s home, piled full of things, and the memories of sleeping next to her grandmother or parents.\n\n\u201cThe movie is like a middleman, to talk between the young generation and the old generation,\u201d Waritsara said.\n\nIt also reflected social problems in the country, she added. A scene in which relatives take off their shoes and place them in a long line to mark their place in a never-ending hospital queue resonated. \u201cIt shows [the state of] the medical welfare here. If the grandma had been rich, I think she could have stayed [alive] longer.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s decision to cut 250 jobs at Manchester United, which caused shock and tears from some employees, will save about \u00a310m a year. With the redundancies worth an estimated \u00a340,000 a head, the saving is part of Ratcliffe\u2019s drive to restructure the club and make it sustainable.\n\nThere is a recognition among the workforce that United have become a bloated operation and the Guardian reported last December that up to 300 jobs were under threat. But when the planned redundancies were communicated at an all-staff meeting on Wednesday, there was surprise among a number of those attending in person or remotely.\n\nThe meeting, which began at noon, was scheduled for an hour but lasted only 15 minutes. The announcement was led by Jean-Claude Blanc, the acting chief executive, who will stand down when Omar Berrada begins as the permanent CEO on 13 July.\n\nBerrada has been on gardening leave since his hiring from Manchester City in January and is expected to join United\u2019s summer tour of the US, which begins when Erik ten Hag\u2019s team fly to Los Angeles on 24 July.\n\nTen Hag signed a new deal to 2026 on Thursday after a review of his candidacy which included Jason Wilcox, the technical director, speaking with numerous potential replacements. Despite the transparent consideration given to replacing the manager, Ten Hag and Ratcliffe\u2019s leadership team recognise the need for unity if United are to be successful.\n\nUnited retain a firm interest in signing the centre-backs Jarrad Branthwaite and Matthijs de Ligt from Everton and Bayern Munich respectively. However Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Harry Maguire may have to be sold for both to be signed because of financial imperatives.\n\nLast month United had a \u00a345m offer for Branthwaite rejected. They will make a second bid only if Everton indicate a willingness to lower their valuation, thought to be a minimum of \u00a360m. United believe De Ligt is worth between \u00a340m and \u00a350m.\n\nOn Friday United and Nice, who are also owned by Ratcliffe, were cleared by Uefa to compete together in next season\u2019s Europa League.

        "title": "Houses and pylons: Labour\u2019s biggest business challenges",
        "body": "A landslide victory for Labour was also a satisfactory result for the vigilantes of the bond market. A Conservative administration that served up Liz Truss\u2019s reckless budget of unfunded giveaways in 2022 has been punished. A Labour party promising fiscal discipline, to the point where it ditched a previous flagship \u00a328bn policy on green investment in case it scared the horses, has been rewarded.\n\nSo, yes, one can see why the UK has suddenly acquired haven-like status in the eyes of financial markets. Unlike the US and France, for instance, international investors now know what they\u2019re getting with the UK: a stable government anxious to demonstrate its market-friendly credentials. Meanwhile, inflation is falling and cuts in interest rates lie around the corner. \u201cWe believe UK government bonds (gilts) are attractive at current levels,\u201d said Peder Beck-Friis, an economist at Pimco, the enormous bond fund manager.\n\nAll that is very helpful for attracting investors, as the incoming chancellor, Rachel Reeves, emphasised throughout the campaign; the big-picture outlook for growth and investment could be worse. Here, though, are two detailed pro-growth targets that look hard to achieve but are central to Labour\u2019s plans. First, the new government wants 1.5m homes to be built in England and Wales in the next five years. Second, it intends to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030.\n\nOn houses, Labour starts from a position where as few as 150,000 might be built this year, half what it needs for a par annual score for its five-year target. Talk to the executives in the housebuilding sector and many think that the ministers will have done well if they get to the implied annual run rate of 300,000 by the end of parliament.\n\nThe ingredient that ministers can directly influence is the planning rules. Reeves has called the planning system \u201cthe single biggest obstacle to our economic success\u201d and Keir Starmer promised last year to \u201cbulldoze through\u201d the UK\u2019s \u201crestrictive planning system\u201d. The taboo of building on the green belt \u2013 or, at least, the \u201cgrey\u201d parts of it \u2013 will be challenged. So expect a return to local authorities being given mandatory targets for housebuilding, as a first step, and funding for planning officers to follow.\n\nEven so, the 1.5m target looks a stretch: supply chains cannot simply be turned on by government diktat. And Labour\u2019s parallel demand for more affordable houses within the mix may cause tensions with big private-sector housebuilders, which dominate the market to a far greater degree than in the 1970s, the last time the UK was building at such a rate.\n\nLabour wants to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. Photograph: Spencer Bowman/Getty\n\nOn energy infrastructure, there is at least a blueprint for reform. Nick Winser, the electricity commissioner, delivered his report to the previous government last August. But note the size of the job, even when the Conservatives were pursuing a deadline of 2035. \u201cIn Great Britain, around four times as much new transmission network will be needed in the next seven years as was built since 1990,\u201d said Winser\u2019s report.\n\nThe biggest impediment are blockages created by the \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d system of allocating hookups to the grid for new wind, solar and battery storage projects. Some developers have been waiting up to 15 years to produce power. The worry is that the system is being gamed by operators who are more interested in selling on a connection rather than building the infrastructure themselves. Ofgem, the regulator, now has rules to kick out such \u201czombie\u201d schemes but, again, that process does not happen overnight.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, Great British Energy \u2013 the state-owned company that will partner with local authorities in local power schemes and with the private sector in novel technologies such as floating off-shore wind \u2013 will take time to set up. Nor does its capitalisation of \u00a38.3bn over the life of the parliament sound like gamechanging money when National Grid alone intends to invest \u00a330bn in the same period.\n\nAnalysts at the investment bank Jefferies think that \u201cLabour\u2019s goal to have a net zero grid by 2030 appears to be an unrealistic target, even with steady progress\u201d. One energy expert it consulted concluded that \u201ceven if the new government executed every project in the pipeline, had linear interconnector growth, and electricity demand on the lowest end of the range, the country would still miss the target by 25%.\u201d The 2030 ambition \u2013 one of the central manifesto pledges for growth \u2013 looks extremely challenging.",

        "body": "When Keir Starmer stood on the steps of 10 Downing Street as our new prime minister, he spoke of hope and of a promise that things will change for the better. But hope is in short supply in my household. At the age of 44, I have never been this skint, this hungry, this cold or this worried.\n\nI am unable to work owing to multiple disabilities, and the past few months have been a very frightening time to be receiving benefits. While I understand people cheering the end of 14 years of the Conservatives, I am nervous that when Starmer promises change he is not thinking about people like me. In his victory speech he spoke of cleaners, builders, and nurses facing insecurity despite doing the right thing. I feel that insecurity every minute of every day, but simply cannot work because of my disabilities. That leaves me completely unable to make ends meet.\n\nPersonal independence payments (Pips) should cover the additional costs of my disabilities, such as a chiropractor to manage the pain of my fibromyalgia, or holistic therapy for my mental health. But the cost of living is so high they never stretch that far. The Conservative party even discussed replacing some of the support I receive with vouchers. This feels like a form of discrimination: it\u2019s demoralising to be trusted only with vouchers rather than money. I am glad to see the back of the Tories, but it\u2019s hard to feel excited about a Labour government when it has made no promises to invest in social security.\n\n\n\nI know many say we have to be patient, and that change will come. But my kids face empty food cupboards on a weekly basis. We cannot wait for this change. It needs to come now. The political debate over this election has been focused on immigration and pledges to support \u201chard-working Britons\u201d while people like me are left to scrabble to get by. What about people who are unwell and who can\u2019t work? When we do feature in political debate, it\u2019s only as a problem that needs fixing: cut our benefits, say the Conservatives; get us back to work says Labour.\n\nEvery day I wake up and try to think of ways to make ends meet. My situation is hopeless: I can\u2019t afford a weekly shop from the supermarket and have now gone two weeks without buying my own shampoo and conditioner. Instead I\u2019ve had to rely on charity. It wasn\u2019t even much better when I was working; in my job as an administrator, I still had to go to the food bank. Levels of social security payment leave families like mine below the poverty line, and yet we still hear comments far too often that imply people choose a life on benefits. But no one would choose this life, my life, and I want this to change, so that families everywhere can have a hope of something better. Families like mine, where no one is in work, have lost an average of \u00a35,500 a year since 2010.\n\nAnd disabled people often face additional costs. My health conditions mean I need to use the washing machine and shower more often than most people \u2013 as is the case with many disabled people \u2013 so capping the price of energy bills would really help. The benefit cap must also go, and free school meals should be universal. This is not asking a lot \u2013 just for our basic needs to be met. Starmer said on the steps of Downing Street that the work of change will begin immediately. I truly hope so. But for me to have trust in him, he must listen to people like me and change our our failing social security system to make a better future possible for us all.",

        "title": "\u2018Beyond marketing, beyond explanation\u2019: how Inside Out and Despicable Me saved the summer",
        "body": "Five weeks ago, Hollywood was in the doldrums. A succession of hotly tipped blockbusters \u2013 The Fall Guy, Furiosa, IF \u2013 flopped. The mood was ominous. The last time early summer box-office takings had been so low was in 2000.\n\nToday, considerably more cheerful records are being broken, thanks entirely to children\u2019s films. Three weeks ago saw the release of Inside Out 2, Pixar\u2019s sequel to its 2015 animation about the emotions jostling for supremacy in the head of an 11-year-old girl named Riley.\n\nEven the most optimistic-seeming predictions were that it would make $80m (\u00a362m) on its first weekend of release in the US. In fact, it made $155m (\u00a3121m). On its second weekend, ticket sales only dropped by 35% (by comparison, Barbie\u2019s fell 43% over the same period in 2023). Last week, Pixar\u2019s latest became the fastest film ever to make a billion dollars worldwide \u2013 in just 19 days.\n\nIn the US, however, it will lose its place at the top of the chart this weekend, when it is toppled by another children\u2019s animation sequel. Despicable Me 4 opened in the US on Wednesday, taking $27m (\u00a321m), and is on course for a five-day total of $120m (\u00a394m) over the Independence Day holiday. (It opens in the UK next Friday.)\n\n\u201cSuccess begets success,\u201d says Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety. Parents who enjoyed taking their children to Inside Out 2 are now primed to repeat the experience. \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d\n\nMy six-year-old thinks Inside Out 2 is the funniest movie he\u2019s ever seen. My mom thinks it\u2019s the saddest. It\u2019s many movies in one Dave Holstein, screenwriter\n\nYet the scale and speed of Inside Out 2\u2019s triumph remains mysterious. \u201cIts explosive success is a potent reminder of what happens when everyone in the world wants to see the same movie,\u201d says Gaydos. \u201cThere is pent up demand that lands on the same square the same day. It\u2019s beyond marketing, beyond explanation.\u201d\n\nChris Meledandri, founder and CEO of Illumination, a division of Universal Pictures and the production studio behind Despicable Me, concurs. \u201cPeople were missing the cinema,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the minute the signals started to flash that Inside Out 2 was the film they\u2019d been waiting for, you saw a kind of a spontaneous eruption.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Chris Meledandri. Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nEven Inside Out 2\u2019s writers were taken aback. \u201cIt\u2019s always surprising when four million people show up to your movie,\u201d says Dave Holstein. His father texted to apologise for not being able to see it over opening weekend. \u201cGo to a different theater,\u201d his son texted back. \u201cAll sold out,\u201d came the reply. \u201cEvery screen, every time.\u201d\n\nWhen Holstein\u2019s co-writer, Meg LeFauve, went to her local cinema on the first Saturday after the film\u2019s release, she was struck by the sight of the popcorn queue snaking round the block. \u201cAt the end of the film,\u201d she says, \u201ceverybody stood up and cheered. I thought: \u2018Oh, OK, we might\u2019ve touched a chord. This could be big.\u2019\u201d\n\nMuch was resting on Inside Out 2\u2019s pulling power. Pixar head Pete Docter, who directed the first film and executive produced the second, last month admitted to muted hopes and minimal fingernails. Should the sequel sink at the cinema, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to think even more radically about how we run our business\u201d.\n\nThe problem Docter identified was a pandemic hangover. Pixar\u2019s decision to release two key titles, Soul and Elemental, straight to streaming had likely habituated audiences to seeing such films on their own sofas.\n\nHowever, Holstein thinks this trend may have helped Inside Out 2. \u201cThe number of people who have seen the first film has grown exponentially since it first came out, because so many people have now caught up with it on Disney+.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Dave Holstein and Meg LeFauve at the Inside Out 2 premiere. Photograph: Alberto E Rodr\u00edguez/Getty Images for Disney/Pixar\n\nInside Out 2 is a family film with cross-generational appeal. It appeals to young children, teenagers (the new movie sees Riley\u2019s headquarters co-opted by Anxiety as she turns 13), twentysomethings who loved the first film, plus parents and grandparents. \u201cIt\u2019s many movies in one,\u201d says Holstein. \u201cMy six-year-old thinks it\u2019s the funniest movie he\u2019s ever seen. My mom thinks it\u2019s the saddest movie she\u2019s ever seen. When my son sees it in 10 years, he\u2019ll have a whole different movie to watch.\u201d\n\nWhile less obviously ambitious offerings such as Super Mario Bros (2023\u2019s second-best-performing film, after Barbie), plus 2024\u2019s Kung Fu Panda 4 ($545m/\u00a3425m) and Garfield ($240m/\u00a3187m), were respectable performers, their target demographic is narrower and takings were correspondingly capped.\n\nAt the end of the film everyone stood up and cheered. I thought: \u2018Oh, we might\u2019ve touched a chord. This could be big\u2019 Meg LeFauve, screenwriter\n\nInside Out\u2019s reach, by contrast, means it performs less like a family film and more like an event movie in the moulds of Marvel or Barbie. Nineteen per cent of its opening weekend audience were aged between 25 and 34, and 18% were between 18 and 24. It seems adults aren\u2019t only willing and eager to take the children \u2013 they\u2019re willing and eager to go without them.\n\nMore surprisingly, this also appears to be the case with Despicable Me 4. Exit figures from its first day of US release suggest 59% of the audience were over 18, with a further 20% aged 13-17. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding,\u201d says Meledandri, \u201cis that there\u2019s a very strong nostalgia factor, which means it\u2019s actually playing across all ages.\u201d\n\nAudiences\u2019 responses also more closely mirror those towards \u201ca full-blown comedy\u201d, says Meledandri, than traditional family fare. \u201cAnd comedy in theatrical films is becoming more and more rare.\u201d Even rarer is mainstream comedy that translates across international territories \u2013 something at which the film\u2019s Spanglish-jabbering minion characters (\u201clanguage-agonistic,\u201d says Meledandri) are old pros.\n\n\u201cEvery part of the world can really lay claim to them in a primary manner,\u201d says Meledandri, \u201cand have the exact same enjoyment.\u201d\n\nBoth films also boast a significant female skew. Inside Out 2 features almost no male characters, while Gru\u2019s focus remains on protecting the three orphan girls he has adopted.\n\nAnd both are buoyed by having a nimble US improv star fronting their promotional drive: Steve Carell (who voices Gru) in the case of Despicable Me 4, and for Inside Out 2, Amy Poehler, who voices Joy.\n\n\u201cThey both have incredible comedy chops, but also huge hearts,\u201d says LeFauve. \u201cAmy is inseparable from Joy. So it\u2019s wonderful from a marketing perspective that she really seems to walk out of the screen.\u201d\n\nYet the business model behind the two series diverges dramatically. Meledandri founded Illumination in 2007, when \u201ca consistency of box-office success\u201d for market leaders DreamWorks, Disney and Pixar meant \u201cthe pressure wasn\u2019t really there on cost containment\u201d.\n\nHis strategy put sustainability at the centre \u2013 with rapid returns. The Despicable Me series is now the top-grossing animated franchise of all time, with box-office takings of almost $5bn (\u00a33.9bn). Profit margins are widened by budget consistency: the first Despicable Me cost $69m (\u00a353.8m) in 2010, the fourth cost $70m (\u00a354.6m). Inside Out 2 cost $200m (\u00a3156m).\n\nView image in fullscreen Vanessa Feltz and family attend screening of Despicable Me 4 in London. Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images for Universal Pictures UK\n\n\u201cThe old formula that the second instalment would do 75% of the business of the first film, and so on, has been thrown out of the window,\u201d says Gaydos.\n\nMeledandri\u2019s model has set significant industry precedent. Now, \u201cmanaging costs has become much more prevalent,\u201d he says, applauding Disney for doing so within such a large and long-established organisation.\n\nDespite this belt-tightening, says Gaydos, \u201cright now, anyone who is in the animation field must be feeling really good. These look like good bets to people who invest in a big way with family movies.\u201d\n\nAnd the key word, he says, is \u201cfamily\u201d \u2013 not \u201canimation\u201d. \u201cRemember that Barbie, which was a huge movie, an Oscars movie, a talking-point movie, was still a movie about a kids\u2019 toy.\u201d\n\nThe difference is that family films are now the predominant genre for everyone. The pictures stayed small. It\u2019s the audiences that got big.",
        "summary": "Even the most optimistic-seeming predictions were that it would make $80m (\u00a362m) on its first weekend of release in the US.\n\u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201dMy six-year-old thinks Inside Out 2 is the funniest movie he\u2019s ever seen.\nIt\u2019s many movies in one Dave Holstein, screenwriterYet the scale and speed of Inside Out 2\u2019s triumph remains mysterious.\nIt\u2019s beyond marketing, beyond explanation.\u201dChris Meledandri, founder and CEO of Illumination, a division of Universal Pictures and the production studio behind Despicable Me, concurs.\nPhotograph: Alberto E Rodr\u00edguez/Getty Images for Disney/PixarInside Out 2 is a family film with cross-generational appeal.",

        "title": "Great Britain? by Torsten Bell \u2013 why Labour must move fast and fix things",
        "body": "Choose your fighter: mission-driven government or radical incrementalism? Evangelical academic or nerdy policy wonk? Economist Mariana Mazzucato\u2019s idea of reconceptualising government around a few long-term goals inspired Keir Starmer\u2019s five \u201cmissions\u201d. Former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation Torsten Bell suggests a more pragmatic approach, set out in this book, published midway through the election campaign. He has just become MP for Swansea West, and will be a key figure in Labour\u2019s Treasury. However, the new government will have to decide \u2013 in rhetoric and action \u2013 which is more convincing.\n\nBell\u2019s case for \u201cradical incrementalism\u201d rests on three pillars. First, that the UK is in deep trouble; we\u2019ve combined abysmal levels of productivity growth, resulting in stagnant real wages and slow growth in living standards, with persistently high levels of inequality and rising levels of severe deprivation. As he notes, \u201cthis should be enough to put to bed the zombie idea that Britain faces a trade-off between growth and equality: being \u2018more normal\u2019 means becoming more prosperous and more equal.\u201d\n\nSecond, the path to \u201cnormality\u201d requires a combination of relatively quick and modest policy shifts with longer-term strategies. From abolishing the two-child benefit cap, which would make a massive difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged kids, to increasing our miserable levels of both private and public investment, Great Britain? is full of policy detail. Much of this \u2013 reforming the planning system so that we can build more houses, reducing the exploitation of lower paid and insecure workers, reforming the tax system so that it taxes richer and older people more and workers less \u2013 is well-trodden territory, largely reflects the consensus among economists and thinktanks, and is none the worse for that. Many of us would be much happier with this prospectus than Labour\u2019s timid and sometimes incoherent manifesto.\n\nAnd third \u2013 and this is perhaps the most important point of difference with the \u201cmission\u201d approach \u2013 many of these changes can and should be implemented quickly. In time, this incrementalism can and should add up to radical change, but we don\u2019t need a fully formulated roadmap to start the journey, and we can\u2019t afford to wait. Bell makes the argument for immediate, concrete change on both principled and political grounds: \u201cEarly victories will incrementally rebuild faith and break us out of the stagnation trap ... in time, higher public investment drives growth, but in the short term it means something almost as important: potholes that are filled in, rather than providing a daily, jolting reminder of the country\u2019s stagnation.\u201d\n\nThe subtext is clear. \u201cMissions\u201d are fine; but, as everyone who\u2019s ever worked on an \u201cinterdepartmental strategy\u201d knows, the risk is that a new government spends its first year setting up working groups, workshops, consultations, and evidence papers, culminating in a big set piece ministerial speech and the publication of a hefty policy document, after which everyone relaxes. Meanwhile, separately, the Treasury won\u2019t stump up the money, the pothole is still there, and the public\u2019s distrust of all politicians ratchets up yet another notch.\n\nAs a civil servant, I helped establish the Child Poverty Unit \u2013 which Labour has highlighted as the exemplar of \u201cmission-driven government\u201d in action. And I am convinced that there is no substitute for objectives, like ending child poverty, that are long-term, ambitious and directly impact people\u2019s lives. But Bell is right that unless government puts its own political capital, and our money, where its mouth is, they will ring hollow. That applies to all of Labour\u2019s missions, from net zero to the NHS to \u201cexpanding opportunity\u201d. Leaving the two-child limit \u2013 which Bell rightly excoriates \u2013 in place, not improving pay and conditions in social care, or failing to address unfair zero-hours contracts will undermine Labour\u2019s credibility from the start.\n\nLabour\u2019s six \u201cfirst steps\u201d suggest that they recognise this, but these range from the specific and quantifiable (more teachers and NHS appointments) to generic politician-speak (economic stability) to bureaucratic deckchair-shuffling (replacing the \u201cIllegal Migration Operation Command\u201d with a \u201cBorder Security Command\u201d). Bell argues convincingly that Labour needs to go further and faster to deliver concrete improvements in people\u2019s lives. As he concludes, \u201cProblems will not vanish overnight \u2013 yet, as we start investing in our own future, the clouds that hover over Britain will lift far more swiftly than we might realise.\u201d Keir Starmer should listen.",

        "body": "The family of a deaf man who was groomed by a gang into taking out a \u00a328,000 business loan has demanded to know how a vulnerable person, with virtually no assets, could be marched into a Metro Bank, and allowed to borrow such a huge sum.\n\nPeter James*, who has special educational needs, and who only communicates through British Sign Language, was being chased by the bank\u2019s debt collectors, and facing possible bankruptcy, before Guardian Money became involved.\n\nHis case, one of the most unusual that we have featured in some time, raises questions about how banks treat people who need help communicating, and what safeguards are in place to stop them being taken advantage of.\n\nIt also highlights how difficult it can be to communicate with Metro Bank when things go wrong.\n\nThe story of what happened to James is somewhat muddled as it was almost four years ago, and the family has only learned exactly what happened in the past two weeks.\n\nIn 2020, James was taken to the Ilford branch of Metro Bank in London, where one of the people with him claimed to be acting on his behalf. There they opened a bank account in his name.\n\nOnce they had presented his ID and he had signed the forms, they disappeared along with his newly issued debit card.\n\nAt some point later, they applied for a business bounceback loan from the bank, and this was paid into the newly opened account.\n\nJames, who lives in a south London council flat with his wife, who is also deaf, had problems during lockdown when his identity was stolen. Covid support grants were applied for, according to his father-in-law, Steve Hall*. HMRC, he says, quickly realised these applications were nothing to do with his son-in-law, and stopped chasing him for repayments.\n\nIt advised him to get Cifas (Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System) registered, which acts as a warning to other lenders faced with credit or loan applications. That was not in place when the loan application was made to Metro Bank, and there were no alarm bells until default notices started arriving on James\u2019s doorstep in late 2021.\n\nThe family explained the situation to the bank. However, rather than accepting it had been defrauded, Hall says Metro Bank held his son-in-law responsible, steadfastly refusing to reveal any information about the loan, or how it was taken out, and continued to demand repayment.\n\nGetting the details out of my son-in-law has been difficult but it now looks as though he has been groomed by a gang Steve Hall\n\nThe family, who attended their local Metro Bank branch, and even issued several subject access requests for information that were all ignored, say they only learned the exact details after Guardian Money\u2019s intervention.\n\n\u201cI help my daughter and, inevitably, her husband, with their financial affairs, and initially thought this must be another case of identity theft,\u201d Hall says.\n\n\u201cGetting the details out of my son-in-law has been very difficult, but it now looks as though he has been groomed by a gang.\n\n\u201cThrough a relation of an old school contact he met \u2013 he doesn\u2019t even know his surname \u2013 he was promised some kind of work in a new business.\u201d\n\nHe was told to bring his passport for a meeting, was picked up from work in a Mercedes car and forced to hand over his phone.\n\nHe was then taken to the Ilford branch of Metro, where the account paperwork was processed.\n\nThroughout this, his contact did all the talking on his behalf, signing the instructions to him as they went. James says he had no idea a loan was being taken out, let alone one in his name.\n\n\u201cAt the end of all this, he says he was dropped back at the tube,\u201d Hall says. \u201cHe had to hand over the bank card in exchange for his phone, and the group disappeared with both the card and, we now know, \u00a328,000.\n\n\u201cPeter says that as he got out of the car, the person signed that he would contact him the next day about the work, told him to be careful and to keep his mouth shut. He never heard from him again.\u201d\n\nThis case would not be the first time a vulnerable person had been used by people purporting to be their friends, or by promising them well-paid work.\n\nView image in fullscreen Metro Bank agreed to write off the loan after the Guardian took up the case. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nWhat the family can\u2019t understand is how Metro decided he was worthy of such a loan. Hall says that while his son-in-law has a steady job, he lives in social housing, and has virtually no discernible assets, with the possible exception of two PlayStations.\n\nMeanwhile, the family has also questioned why staff at the branch did not ask to see any ID of the person who accompanied him.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to the Metro branch to try to get some answers, we all had to produce our ID, but it seems the person who was interpreting while this loan was taken out, didn\u2019t,\u201d Hall says.\n\n\u201cHow can a bank give such a large loan to an obviously vulnerable person without authenticating the person acting on their behalf. It is all very troubling.\u201d\n\nAfter Guardian Money took up the case, Metro Bank has agreed to write off the loan and will no longer be pursuing James.\n\nIt says this decision was made on the basis of the new information that has come to light, of which it was previously unaware.\n\nIt says: \u201cInvestigating this case revealed how unscrupulous scammers are \u2013 they will prey on anyone.\n\n\u201cWe would like to remind your readers to be wary of being rushed, or pressured, into opening financial accounts and credit cards, sharing personal details (passwords, account numbers, security numbers, passcodes, etc) and even handing over/transferring money. All of these are red flags for a fraud, in addition to the more obvious one of someone threatening you.\n\n\u201cIf you are in any doubt, contact your bank as soon as it is safe for you to do so, to share your concerns.\u201d\n\nIt says that it is not Metro Bank policy to ask for the ID of anyone attending a branch with one of its customers, even when that person is applying for a significant loan, meaning this could happen again.\n\nFor its part, the family has called on Metro to learn lessons from the case.\n\nUltimately, though, they are just delighted that they can put the matter behind them now that the loan has been written off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just paid my annual \u00a375 (subscription) to the Guardian, which seems a ludicrously low price to pay for such service,\u201d Hall says.\n\n* Names have been changed\n\nThe option of only being able to make big bank transfers when you are at home, or running any big payments past a close friend or relative, are among new tools to fight scammers that are being offered to customers of the digital bank Monzo.\n\nThere were almost 3m confirmed cases of payment fraud last year, with a combined value of \u00a31.2bn.\n\nAs well as authorised push payment (APP) scams, where someone is persuaded to transfer money to a fraudster, customers also need to be wary of shoulder surfing, where a thief watches for their phone password before swiping their device.\n\nMonzo\u2019s security controls will now let customers set up \u201cknown locations\u201d, which they will need to be in if they want to make a bank transfer or withdrawal over a limit of their choice. If anyone attempts a transfer outside those locations, it will be refused.\n\nView image in fullscreen Make sure no one can see when you enter your phone\u2019s password. Photograph: deepblue4you/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe \u201ctrusted contacts\u201d tool will allow customers to set up family members or friends to check any transaction over their set minimum, while a secret QR code will let them verify their identity with an individual code stored on a different device or on paper.\n\nMonzo \u2013 which operates as an app-based service \u2013 says its security controls \u201cadd a much-needed moment of pause while in the process of transferring money out of an account, encouraging people to stop and think about whether they\u2019re being targeted by fraudsters\u201d.\n\nCustomers can choose whether to opt in to the controls or not, but if they do decide to use them, they must choose two so that there is a second backup check if the first fails for some reason.",

        "body": "Complaints from Taylor Swift fans who paid \u00a3660 each for premium concert seats but say their views were blocked by stage equipment have thrown the spotlight on \u201cVIP\u201d tickets and exactly what you get for your money.\n\nWhile some will be surprised that anyone would pay more than \u00a3600 for a ticket and a few items of \u201cmerch\u201d, particularly in a cost of living crisis, pricey packages offering a supposedly once-in-a-lifetime experience are becoming increasingly common.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing growing fan demand for VIP experiences in the UK,\u201d the ticketing company Ticketmaster told Guardian Money.\n\nIt says 80% of VIP ticket buyers are aged over 40 but adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a growing interest among gen Z.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift packages \u2013 good value?\n\nThe US megastar recently finished a string of huge UK dates and is coming back for five more at Wembley in August.\n\nLast Sunday, the Guardian\u2019s sister paper, the Observer, featured a letter from a reader who paid more than \u00a32,640 for four tickets for one of the concerts in Liverpool as a treat for their daughters. When they arrived, the reader says they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment.\n\nView image in fullscreen Taylor Swift on stage at Wembley last month. Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management\n\nAs well as standing tickets costing either \u00a3110 or \u00a3172 and seats priced at between \u00a358 and \u00a3194, there were six different VIP packages on sale. Each offered a ticket (either seated or standing) plus the same set of \u201cexclusive\u201d merchandise, including a tote bag, four prints and VIP tour laminate. These packages ranged in price from \u00a3196 to \u00a3662. (All these prices are for the Wembley shows, although those for the other UK venues were very similar.)\n\nThe most expensive is the It\u2019s Been A Long Time Coming package, and this is the one the Observer reader bought for her daughters. It promised an \u201cunforgettable\u201d seat.\n\nMost, if not all, of the packages were quickly snapped up as soon as they went on sale in July last year, and therein lies the potential problem with these sorts of deals: fans are allocated a specific seat way before any detailed thought has been given to the stage configuration and where things such as the sound equipment and lighting rigs are going to be positioned.\n\nThe It\u2019s Been A Long Time Coming package appears to be the least good value if you assume it includes a top-price (\u00a3194 at Wembley) seated ticket, as that means you are effectively paying \u00a3466 for the gifts. That is, unless buyers were allocated tickets that the organisers claim are even better than the \u00a3194 ones.\n\nThe Ready For It package, meanwhile, cost Wembley buyers \u00a3277 each and included a \u00a3110 general admission standing ticket \u2013 so you are effectively paying \u00a3167 for the extras. But this package also includes \u201cearly entry\u201d, enabling fans to bag a prime spot, which some will rate as a valuable perk, although you only get a 30-minute head start.\n\nMoney-no-object meet and greets\n\nIn 2009, Britons were being offered Beyonc\u00e9 packages where you got to say hello to the superstar, have your photo taken with her and watch the concert from a front-row seat. The price: \u00a31,265 per person.\n\nView image in fullscreen John Lydon recently finished a UK spoken word tour. Photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian\n\nOne of the priciest VIP meet-and-greet ticket packages currently on offer is for Ms Lauryn Hill and the Fugees, who are playing London (the O2) and Manchester (Co-op Live) in October. The cost is \u00a3885 and \u00a3879 respectively.\n\nSome gen Z-ers may be more tempted by the 21-year-old Italian-Norwegian singer Alessandra, best known for her Eurovision song contest 2023 track Queen of Kings, who is playing UK dates next February. VIP meet-and greet tickets for her London date at Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire are \u00a3121. You get goodies including access to the pre-show sound check and a photo opportunity using your phone \u201cso you can share straight to your socials\u201d.\n\nThe best-value package we found was for the former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon \u2013 AKA Johnny Rotten \u2013 who this week finished a UK spoken word tour. For about \u00a390, fans got a VIP meet and greet including a photo opportunity and autograph, a goodie bag including a print of an original artwork by Lydon and a lanyard, and a best-in-the-house seat.\n\nWeird and wonderful gifts and experiences\n\nCyndi Lauper has to be the winner of this category. Fresh from her set at Glastonbury, she is selling tickets for a UK tour next February and offering a VIP ticket package costing up to \u00a3482. In addition to a message delivered via QR code, you get an Uber to and from the venue, a pre-gig \u201cexclusive on-stage photo\u201d (but without Lauper present) and the chance to check out her \u201cglam station and button-making station\u201d \u2013 whatever they are.\n\nView image in fullscreen Cyndi Lauper on stage at Glastonbury last month. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nFor those flushed with cash \u2026\n\nGeneral admission tickets for Kylie\u2019s London Hyde Park show next Saturday (13 July) currently cost \u00a3111 but if you like the idea of separate toilets away from the masses, there are a range of VIP ticket options offering those plus, usually, a closer view of the stage \u2026 priced at between \u00a3324 and \u00a3434.\n\nAt the cheaper end of the spectrum, the Irish singer Hozier is playing Chepstow Racecourse in Monmouthshire, Wales, on Tuesday (9 July), and general admission tickets are \u00a349, but for \u00a379 you get a \u201cpremium view\u201d at the front and access to \u201cposh flushable loos\u201d.",

        "body": "I have much good fortune in my life, but in one respect I am unlucky: I live in the part of the country with the longest waiting times for driving tests, and I have been learning to drive.\n\nI began learning in 2022. In June 2023, I was test-ready. But when I tried to book my test, there were none available until mid-November, meaning I had to pay for six extra months of lessons so I wouldn\u2019t forget what I had learned.\n\nI failed that test \u2013 a stupid, nervous mistake. After time off to lick my wounds, I rebooked my test in January. The earliest test I could get? In late June 2024.\n\nThe result of all this was that by the time I went for my second test last month, I had spent at least \u00a31,000 on a year of unnecessary lessons. And I had the pressure of knowing that if I failed, I\u2019d have to wait another six months, and pay out yet again.\n\nI am not alone. In 2019, the average waiting time for a driving test at my local London test centre was 2.8 weeks. As of 4 March 2024, it was 24 weeks. Four years on from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused driving tests to be suspended, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), which carries out the tests in Great Britain (Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Driver and Vehicle Agency), has not recovered.\n\nWhile waiting times are coming down in Wales and Scotland, in England the situation is getting worse. In March 2022, the average waiting time for a practical car driving test in England was 14.5 weeks. In March 2023, it was 15.8 weeks. As of March 2024, it was 17.8 weeks, more than double the seven-week target set out in the DVSA\u2019s annual report.\n\nYou give them your personal information, they use it to abuse the system, and create a bigger backlog, and it goes on\u2019 Max Sobol\n\nBut according to the DVSA, I am the problem. Me and all the other learner drivers, for booking driving tests before they\u2019re ready. As a result, says the DVSA chief executive, Loveday Ryder, in a chiding blog post, \u201cthose who need to drive for their job, such as nurses and carers\u201d aren\u2019t able to access tests. If only we\u2019d stop being so irresponsible, NHS nurses and carers could go to work.\n\nThere is a straightforward way to determine whether this is true. If learner drivers booking tests when they aren\u2019t ready is causing the backlog, the pass rate would be down post-Covid.\n\nBut Guardian analysis of DVSA data reveals that the pass rate for learner drivers has actually gone up post-pandemic. In the five years from April 2014 to March 2019, the average pass rate in England was 47.8%, whereas post-Covid, from April 2021 to December 2023, it averaged 48.2%. England is no outlier: throughout Great Britain the pass rate post-Covid is higher \u2013 46.6% for April 2014 to March 2019, versus 48.9% for April 2021 to December 2023.\n\nSo if learner drivers aren\u2019t the problem, what\u2019s really going on at the DVSA?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for festival tickets,\u201d says Calu Malta, 27, who works for a non-profit organisation. In March, she woke up at 6am on a Monday morning, when the DVSA releases new tests, to book a driving test near her home in north London. Malta will have to wait six months for her test, in August.\n\nWhen a test becomes available, says Sue Smith, 62, a Newbury driving instructor who searches for her students, \u201cit\u2019s like having heart palpitations. You have to have the fastest fingers in the west.\u201d As a result, some learners are seeing their theory tests, which are only valid for two years, expire before they can pass.\n\nThere is a way to get a test faster \u2013 on the black market. Dozens of businesses offer fast-track tests, advertised through WhatsApp groups, websites and driving schools. The array of dates on offer is staggering. Fees range from \u00a3120 to \u00a3350 for tests that should cost \u00a362.\n\nView image in fullscreen Max Sobol: \u2018I suppose it\u2019s silly giving these companies your driving licence details, but it\u2019s the only way you can get a test.\u2019 Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\nWhen faced with an impossible dilemma \u2013 spend hundreds on extra lessons, or pay touts \u2013 many decide that the second option is cheaper. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d says Dan Cloake, a 35-year-old lighting technician from east London. In April, he paid \u00a3170 for a fast-track driving test through a WhatsApp group promising \u201cearly driving bookings\u201d. \u201cThis is a public service and we are having to pay this private tax.\u201d\n\nIn order to book his test, Cloake sent the touts a photo of his provisional driving licence. \u201cIt had my home address, my date of birth, quite a lot of personal information on it,\u201d he says. Is he worried about what the touts have done with his data, I ask.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Cloake slowly. \u201cA little bit. Now I am thinking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a constant battle to keep on top of these bot things,\u201d said Ryder when giving evidence to the transport committee last July. Touts use automated software, known as bots, to reload the DVSA website until a test becomes available, then grab it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all above board,\u201d insists a Bradford-based driving instructor as he offers me a fast-track driving test slot for \u00a3200. \u201cNothing illegal.\u201d I\u2019ve called asking for his assistance in booking a driving test in Thornbury, where waiting times last year averaged 24 weeks. \u201cYou tell me when you need it,\u201d he says genially.\n\nHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s not illegal to sell a driving test for profit, although it is a violation of the DVSA\u2019s terms of use. But when you examine how the touts operate, evidence of illegality emerges.\n\nThere are two main ways to book a driving test: the public access system, open to the general public, and the business system, accessible to driving instructors and driving schools. On the business system, instructors and schools can book multiple tests, and, crucially, they can swap tests between different learners.\n\nBut in order to book a test, everyone, including instructors, needs a provisional driving licence, registered to someone who has passed their theory test. So how do the test companies do it?\n\n\u201cOn our system,\u201d boasts the director of one firm that offers fast-track test slots for between \u00a3190 and \u00a3250, \u201cwe have loads and loads of other licences, all looking for test dates. So what we\u2019re able to do, using their licence, is hold and reserve test dates, basically swap people in.\u201d\n\nThe smooth-talking Londoner says that one of the agencies he partners with to book tests has \u201c8,000 licences able to hold and reserve test dates for other customers. And as soon as one comes available, they\u2019ll hold it, reserve it, wait for the customer to confirm, then just swap them in.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Waiting for a driving test is like \u2018waiting for festival tickets\u2019, says learner driver Calu Malta. Photograph: macana/Alamy\n\nThis is how some touts operate: by reserving tests using other people\u2019s driving licences without their consent, in a probable violation of data protection laws, and then switching in the details of whoever buys the test. A Time Out writer recently wrote about having her driving licence used to book 53 tests without her knowledge. She\u2019d previously given her details to touts.\n\nFraudsters have even sent out phishing emails, purporting to be from the DVSA, asking driving instructors to share learners\u2019 licences. \u201cThe police don\u2019t have the resources to take proper action against fraud,\u201d says Dr Ben Collier, an online crime expert at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cFrauds like this are almost seen as not illegal.\u201d\n\nIn the driving instructor community, it\u2019s common knowledge that some instructors participate in these scams, to the frustration of their peers. \u201cInstructors are buying tests,\u201d says Simon Brady, 59, an instructor from Bradford. \u201cThey do it without their pupil\u2019s knowledge. They get their driving licence details and sell it to someone else.\u201d\n\nWhen Max Sobol, a 39-year-old film director from east London, paid \u00a3132 for a fast-track driving test in April 2022, he sent a photo of his driving licence over WhatsApp to the touts. Sobol failed his test in May and struggled to book another. Not wanting to pay for another black market test, Sobol\u2019s partner contacted the DVSA in July 2022 \u2013 only for the DVSA to tell her that Sobol actually had a test booked for that October.\n\nStopping the ability to swap tests means the scam will fall to pieces. It\u2019s the only solution. But the DVSA won\u2019t do it Simon Brady, driving instructor\n\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s silly to be giving these companies your driving licence details,\u201d Sobol says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only way you can get a test. You give them your personal information, they use it to abuse the system, and create a bigger backlog, and it goes on. You\u2019re over a barrel with it.\u201d\n\nLike an arsonist who burns down your house, then sells you a tent, the touts offer a solution to a problem they created. But Ryder doesn\u2019t see the black market touts as fuelling the crisis, only as a symptom of it. \u201cThis problem,\u201d she told the committee, \u201cwill go away when the wait times come down.\u201d\n\nAs well as blaming long waiting times on the public, for booking tests before they are ready, the DVSA has pointed the finger at the people who carry them out. Driving examiners went on strike in December 2022 and January 2023. \u201cWe were seeing a steady improvement \u2026 until the industrial action part started,\u201d Ryder told the select committee.\n\nThe DVSA does not appear to have undertaken much soul-searching about whether it might have done anything differently. After scores of driving instructors left angry comments under a post about waiting times, the DVSA turned off comments on a subsequent post. \u201cThis is not about censoring your views,\u201d it said.\n\nYet the cause of the waiting times crisis is simple. There aren\u2019t enough tests to clear the backlog, and many of those that are available are being sold on the black market.\n\nAccording to Guardian analysis of DVSA data, as of 2024, the total Covid backlog for Great Britain is more than 1m tests. Since pandemic restrictions ended in 2021, the agency has made available an extra 212,000 tests, meaning that, at the current rate, it will not clear the Covid backlog until 2026.\n\n\u201cThe core of this problem is that there are not enough practical tests for everyone,\u201d says Rachel Newland, 46, a driving instructor from Reading. \u201cAnd the reason for that is that there is an examiner retention crisis. Until the DVSA acknowledges that, nothing will be fixed.\u201d Newland campaigns for the DVSA to increase examiner pay: a petition she set up currently has 1,883 signatures.\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul Weinberger, who has created a bot to get around block bookings by companies. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian\n\nAs of July 2023, the DVSA had recruited 474 new driving examiners since March 2021. But about 15 examiners quit each month.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. Examiners test seven students a day, work weekends for no additional pay and are often abused by members of the public. For all of this, they are paid about \u00a327,000 a year.\n\nAs civil servants, driving examiners cannot speak to the media. But conversations with well-placed sources reveal a stressed-out workforce. Candidates are angry at having to wait so long for tests, and take it out on them. They are being sent out with unsafe candidates in non-dual control cars. They are genuinely fearful of crashes. They feel frustrated and underappreciated. Another strike was narrowly avoided earlier this year.\n\nBecause the government determines civil service pay, the DVSA cannot put up salaries. But it could ask the government to make reselling tests illegal.\n\n\u201cStop the ability to swap tests,\u201d says Brady. \u201cThen the whole scam will fall to pieces. It\u2019s the only solution. But the DVSA won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe DVSA is resistant to this change because most driving instructors use the test-swapping service responsibly, to trade candidates who aren\u2019t ready for their tests with candidates who are. Yet those benefits are marginal, given the way the system facilitates an exploitative black market. We cannot swap GP appointments, or primary school places, or NHS operations. Why must we be able to switch driving tests?\n\nIn the absence of the one change that would work, the DVSA has reduced the amount of times driving tests can be changed from 10 to six, and implemented more anti-bot protections incorporating AI technology. It says it has created nearly 150,000 new tests and redeployed managers to help clear the backlog. It has a counter-fraud team that reports to social media networks if necessary. To date it has issued 231 warnings, suspended 687 accounts, and closed 570 accounts for misuse of the booking system, and removed 4,700 accounts that were not linked to approved driving instructors. It urges the public only to book their driving tests themselves, or through their driving instructor, to prevent their information being misused.\n\nIn January 2023 it made it a violation of its terms of service to sell driving tests for profit, or use driving licences without consent. But dozens of touts continue to flout these rules. And so English learners must choose between waiting six months for a test, or paying the touts and risk having their data misused. But there is a third way.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right that I should have to pay the black market for something that\u2019s a public service,\u201d says Paul Weinberger. In July 2022, Weinberger, who is 31 and lives in south London, needed a driving test, but his test centre had an 18.5-week wait.\n\nIt took Weinberger, who is a software developer, one evening to build a bot to search the DVSA website, and it took that bot two days to find him a test. \u201cIt was quite simple,\u201d he says. After he\u2019d passed his test, Weinberger uploaded details of the bot to Reddit. \u201cPlease be kind,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand do try to not make a business out of this.\u201d\n\nSince Weinberger built his bot, the DVSA has introduced stricter anti-bot protections. I meet Weinberger in a cafe to see if his bot still works. He instals it on my laptop and smiles as it begins reloading the DVSA page, looking for slots. \u201cIt still works,\u201d he says.\n\nOne woman had her driving licence used to book 53 tests without her knowledge. She\u2019d previously given her details to touts\n\nRyder has said that the DVSA plans to rebuild its booking system. If that removes the ability to switch tests, an exploitative industry will slam to an emergency stop. But the conditions that allowed it to start up will remain.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a lot of public services are broken,\u201d says Cloake. \u201cThis is just another example.\u201d Fourteen years since austerity began, we are used to non-functioning public infrastructure. We pay a tax to access basic services, such as booking driving tests, because we have no expectation of things getting better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m originally from Brazil,\u201d says Malta. \u201cIn Brazil, you have to pay to make things accessible. It\u2019s scary to see that happening here.\u201d\n\nAs for me, I passed my driving test. If I\u2019d failed, I wouldn\u2019t have waited another six months for a test. I\u2019d have fired up Weinberger\u2019s bot instead: my indefatigable friend, a middleman who\u2019s not trying to make money from my misfortune.\n\nWith data by Tural Ahmedzade",

It has a new tyre but there is no record that it has been done.\n\nGatwick airport parking is not accepting liability for the damage and refusing to compensate us for our onward travel costs.\n\nES, by email\n\nUsing valet parking has always been a leap of faith because if your car is damaged by a valet, or in the car park, the cover normally offered is very limited. If you do use these services a good tip is to take a picture of the mileage and fuel gauge when you drop off your vehicle as it will help with any postmortem. You did not do this.\n\nThe Gatwick service is run by NCP and, according to its account of events, it says the employee returning your BMW 2 Series to the airport reported smoke, followed by a bang, and stopped immediately.\n\nIt was thought to be a puncture, so it arranged for a replacement tyre so as not to delay your journey home on a bank holiday. The tyre fitter diagnosed the underlying problem.\n\nThe terms and conditions of this service state: \u201cWe and our subcontractors are insured for any loss or damage to your vehicle which happens as a result of our employees and subcontractors not driving carefully.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for you, Gatwick says: \u201cThe damage to the vehicle in question was caused by a broken coil spring and classed as mechanical wear and tear, therefore we are unable to accept any liability. We have issued the passenger a full refund for their parking as a gesture of goodwill.\u201d\n\nIt has agreed to refund the \u00a3150 cost of the valet parking but, after footing a \u00a31,000 repair bill, you don\u2019t think the explanation adds up. However, as the car has more than 50,000 miles on the clock, you might struggle to prove this was not wear and tear, as it says.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

It no longer issues paper or cards. To my mind this is digital exclusion.\n\nWhen I contacted M&S it said the decision to move Sparks online was based on customer feedback.

The figure for London was \u00a32,652 a month \u2013 almost three times the \u00a3894 asked for in north-east England.\n\nRightmove said the average advertised rent outside London in May was an inflation-busting 7% higher than a year earlier.\n\nIn the capital, meanwhile, an improvement in the balance between supply and demand meant annual rent growth has slowed from its peak of 18% in 2022 to 4% in May this year, still higher than the 2% official consumer prices index (CPI) inflation figure for May.\n\nRightmove called on the next government \u201cto accelerate housebuilding and incentivise landlords to invest in more homes for tenants\u201d to help tackle the supply and demand imbalances and stabilise rental growth.\n\nIt said its analysis showed about 120,000 more rental properties were needed to return rent growth to \u201cmore normal levels\u201d of about 2% a year, based on current demand.\n\nRent rises have been blamed largely on demand greatly outstripping supply, exacerbated by landlords with buy-to-let mortgages trying to pass on sizeable increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.\n\nIn many areas there were \u201cnowhere near enough homes to satisfy the number of tenants looking to move\u201d, Rightmove said.\n\nScotland was the hardest hit by supply and demand imbalances, the property company said. By contrast, the situation had improved in London owing to fewer tenants looking to move and an increase in available properties to rent.\n\nTim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s property expert, said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget there was a time before the pandemic where rental price growth was more stable. [Annual] price growth at 7% suggests we are still out of balance.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe next government should be prioritising an improvement to the planning process, an acceleration of housebuilding, and encouraging more supply into the rental market.\u201d\n\nSeparate figures from Propertymark, a professional body for estate and letting agents, showed there were about nine new applicants registered for each available UK property in May.\n\nIt said that though most of its members reported that rents were continuing to increase or were static, there was some good news for prospective tenants with 18% of firms reporting rents falling against 12% in April.",

        "body": "Greg Jackson, CEO and founder of Octopus Energy\n\nView image in fullscreen Greg Jackson Photograph: Octopus Energy/PA\n\nThis result is a landslide for the green economy. There\u2019s hundreds of billions of pounds in capital waiting to come into the UK\u2019s green energy sector \u2013 but in recent years the political instability in the UK means investors have lacked the confidence to make this happen.\n\nIn the run-up to this election the Labour party spent a good couple of years speaking to business leaders in the energy sector, and across the economy, about their concerns. The amount of dialogue they have had means they know what business needs, and they now have the parliamentary majority to deliver it.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity for a Labour government to deliver bold reforms which can unleash green growth. And the sooner they start, the sooner these changes can bring benefit to the UK. Planning reform is arcane and complex and challenging, but this is the key to kickstarting growth.\n\nMargherita Della Valle, chief executive of Vodafone Group\n\nView image in fullscreen Margherita Della Valle Photograph: Vodafone/Reuters\n\nThe new government is right to focus on growth and boosting investment. It is also good to see that Labour will place investment in infrastructure at the heart of its industry strategy. Understandably, with the UK\u2019s stretched public finances, there will also be a greater focus on the private sector to support the much-needed injection of investment to fuel this growth.\n\nUnderpinning the potential of so many different sectors are networks and connectivity. Yet at a time when network infrastructure has never been more important to the economy, the UK is falling behind. Labour\u2019s manifesto rightly recognises the issue through its commitment to \u201cnational 5G coverage by 2030\u201d.\u201d\n\nMick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers\u2019 union Aslef\n\nView image in fullscreen Mick Whelan Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer\n\nThe opportunity to give hope and aspiration to millions, after a decade and a half, cannot be underestimated. There is a massive task, with 14 million in poverty after 14 years of economic incompetence. This Labour government can make work pay, grow the economy, and give ordinary people their voice back.\n\nCloser to home, it must grow green integrated transport, rather than protecting the failed private interests of a quarter of a century of rail privatisation.\n\nWe look forward to early discussions on resolving the longest rail dispute in history. Aslef expect nothing, but naturally hope for a resolution. And we think, though we don\u2019t know, that it\u2019s possible. The Tory government was obstructive, effectively acting as puppet master to the train operating companies. If this Labour government allows us to deal with the employers, without their hands being tied, anything is possible.\n\nJennie Daly, CEO of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey\n\nView image in fullscreen Jennie Daly\n\nHousing delivery has a vital role to play in our society and in unlocking economic growth across the UK through investment, not just into much-needed energy efficient new homes, but in the associated investment in community infrastructure such as schools and amenities, and local transport infrastructure.\n\nA decade-long problem of under-resourcing in the planning system and lack of ambition at all political levels has driven a rapid decline in both new housing development and planning consents across the country, and so we welcome the Labour party\u2019s longstanding focus on the reform of planning policy and look forward to working closely with them to enable the delivery of critical new housing.\u201d\n\nAlastair Currie, CEO of events equipment hire group SLX\n\nView image in fullscreen Alastair Currie\n\nQuite frankly, [the past few years] have been chaotic, I\u2019ve felt very lonely, and on my own [as a business], and you just have to deal with what you can control in front of you. I think we\u2019ve got to have a change. And I sincerely hope that it does make a difference.\n\n\n\nI know it\u2019s not going to be quick, because there are so many calls on government funds with the health service and education. I just think that we need a longer, more strategic plan for our relationships with Europe. It seems crazy not to be more open in a market that we\u2019re so close to.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s really been driven home to me over the last six months [working on the Paris Olympics], just how difficult we\u2019ve made life for ourselves. It just doesn\u2019t help with relationships, either, because it creates an awkward divide.\n\n\n\nFrom the new government, I would love better European relationships and I think some stability around taxes for business would be good. And if there could be a squeeze on the interest rate, that\u2019d be amazing too.\n\nAndy Higginson, chair of JD Group and of the British Retail Consortium\n\nAndy Higginson Photograph: Emma Slater\n\nWe hope for but don\u2019t expect a bit of boost from the arrival of a new government. The situation isn\u2019t great in terms of the economy and they need to be brave to tackle some of the issues.\n\nI was impressed by [shadow chancellor] Rachel Reeves and her perspective on City regulation and the need to get that side of the economy driving. The investing environment in the UK is weak and banks are off the pitch for a lot of small and medium-sized businesses. The stock market is weak in terms of valuations and the amount of money flowing into things. I think with her economist background she seems to have a good plan for that.\n\nLabour have said they will look at business rates and all retailers are looking at that with some hope. I think they know it\u2019s a distorted tax in sense that it is old and out of date and needs adjustment to create a level playing field.\n\nOn workers\u2019 rights, we employ a lot of people at the lower end of the pay scale and for them to be a bit better-off is good. What we don\u2019t want to do is affect the competitivity of business, and Labour have tried to reassure on that. I am hoping the reforms will be sensible and not drag on any of the good things in the economy like flexibility.\n\nPhil Urban, CEO of pubs and restaurants group Mitchells & Butlers\n\nView image in fullscreen Phil Urban\n\nAll changes of government bring opportunities and challenges that businesses have to take advantage of or overcome. At M&B we have not spent much time overthinking what a Labour government will mean other than looking at their manifesto. We will cross the bridges as they arise, and seek out how to optimise all the changes they make.\n\n\n\nIn terms of hopes, we would like to think they will recognise the value of the hospitality sector and recognise that if they give us a break through business rates reform, a reduction in employer national insurance contributions, speed up the planning process, and ideally bring VAT in line with Europe, then the sector will thrive, investing as it does so and creating jobs.\n\n\n\nGetting some stability and certainty can only help, so settling the election early has been a positive outcome.\n\nPaul Thwaite, CEO of NatWest Group\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul Thwaite\n\nGrowing our economy to help increase prosperity and raise the living standards of people across the UK is, rightly, a priority for our new government. The financial services sector will be a crucial partner if we are to achieve this shared ambition.\n\nWe welcome the government\u2019s commitment to work with the private sector through long-term policies such as the National Wealth Fund and a modern industrial strategy.\n\nTo support our economy, we also need a competitive banking sector. We have a strong track record of high regulatory standards and consumer protections, and this must continue. However, I believe there are practical reforms in areas like fraud, competitiveness and regulation that would better enable banks to support customers and promote investment.\n\nI look forward to working with the government and across industries to make meaningful progress on critical issues that will help to create jobs and prosperity in every region and nation of the UK.",

        "body": "The labor market started to ease in June, with 206,000 jobs added to the US economy last month, according to new labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nThe number of new jobs is close to what economists had expected for the month. The figures represent a slight cooling compared to May, when the economy added a revised 218,000 jobs.\n\nThe unemployment rate in June was 4.1%, a 0.1% increase compared with May and the first time the rate has been above 4% in over two years.\n\nData released earlier this week suggested the labor market was starting to cool. Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers added 150,000 jobs in June, down from 157,000 in May. Job losses also appear to be growing. Executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported 48,786 job cuts in June, down from 63,816 cuts in May but still a nearly 20% increase compared with June of last year.\n\nThe jobs figures, released on the first Friday of every month, have been closely watched by Wall Street, which is eager to see interest rates drop, and in Washington, where the strength of hiring has been one of the few bright spots for the Biden administration, which is struggling with poor polling on its economic policies.\n\nAlong with inflation figures, which come out later in the month, the Federal Reserve uses jobs figures to determine whether the economy is cooling and ready for interest rates to drop.\n\nLast month, officials at the Fed kept rates at a two-decade high of around 5.3%, where it has been for nearly a year. The Fed has been trying to bring inflation down to 2%. In May, inflation sat at 3.4% \u2013 lower than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but still higher than the Fed\u2019s target rate.\n\nMinutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting were released on Wednesday and showed the central bank was waiting for \u201cadditional favorable data\u201d before making cuts.\n\nBut in bringing inflation down, the Fed must make sure the labor market is not cooling too much. Earlier this week, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said at an event that the economy has \u201cmade a lot of progress\u201d and has \u201cseen a pretty substantial move toward better balance\u201d in the labor market.\n\n\u201cWe want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down. We want to understand that the levels that we\u2019re seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation,\u201d Powell said.\n\nInflation figures for June will be released on 11 July. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is on 30 and 31 July.",

        "body": "Housebuilders rallied sharply on the London stock market after Labour\u2019s landslide general election victory as investors bet that Keir Starmer\u2019s pledge to bulldoze planning rules and build 1.5m new homes would benefit the sector.\n\nAfter the party secured a majority widely expected in financial markets, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies and the pound edged higher on Friday while government borrowing costs remained roughly unchanged.\n\nThe FTSE 100 later pared gains to finish the day down 0.5% at 8,203, while the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 closed up 0.9%.\n\nCity analysts said a clear Labour win could bring stability to British politics after years of turmoil under the Conservatives since the 2016 Brexit vote, while positioning Britain as a \u201csafe haven\u201d for global investors amid rising political instability in the US and France.\n\n\u201cA landslide victory provides the sort of clarity and stability that equity markets need in an increasingly volatile world,\u201d said Ben Ritchie, the head of developed market equities at the fund manager abrdn. \u201cIf the new government get this right, businesses with significant exposure to the UK economy should be the likely winners.\u201d\n\nHousebuilders were the biggest gainers, with Persimmon, Vistry, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey among the top risers in the FTSE 100.\n\nShares in Crest Nicholson jumped as much as 11% after it reportedly rebuffed a bid from its rival Avant Homes, which is owned by the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors.\n\nAvant made an all-share proposal to the board of Crest last month, Sky News reported, which was rejected. Elliott would have become the biggest shareholder in the combined group. Weeks earlier Crest had rejected a bid from Bellway, another London-listed housebuilder, that valued the business at \u00a3650m.\n\nAnalysts at the investment bank Jefferies said Labour\u2019s win was \u201ca major positive for UK housebuilders\u201d as the party \u201cappears more supportive, engaged and focused on delivery of homes\u201d.\n\nStarmer had made planning reform a centrepiece of his election campaign to \u201cget Britain building again\u201d, aiming to spur economic growth, create jobs and build 1.5m new homes over the next parliament.\n\nThe pound rose 0.4% against the dollar to $1.28, with sterling the strongest performing big currency against the dollar this year after rallying in the run-up to Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\nCurrency markets had widely priced in a Labour landslide and Starmer\u2019s key message that he would seek to restore stability, improve economic growth and take a fiscally responsible approach to government.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inflation has returned to the government\u2019s 2% target, after a prolonged period of soaring price rises and a peak inflation rate of 11.1% in October 2022. That was the highest level in 41 years.\n\nThe economy has recovered from a shallow recession at the end of 2023 and grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of the 2024, in the latest official data.\n\nAs inflation comes down, the Bank of England is expected to start cutting interest rates, possibly as soon as next month, in a move that will provide relief and hope for households facing sharply higher mortgage costs.\n\nKathleen Brooks, the research director at the broker XTB, said investors would now concentrate on what Labour does in the early days of power.\n\n\u201cThe focus now will quickly shift to Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first 100 days in office, and how he lays out his economic plans to boost growth at the same time as improving public services.\u201d",

        "title": "Markets left barely stirred by Labour\u2019s thumping election win",
        "body": "Shares rose a bit. The pound barely budged on the currency markets. There was no shortage of demand for UK government bonds. A dramatic night in politics left the City relatively unmoved.\n\nThere were three big reasons for that. The first was that a thumping Labour victory had been expected for months. It was, in the parlance of financial markets, fully priced in. A hung parliament would have been a different story but there was never any real prospect of that, and once the results of the exit poll were announced the result was not in doubt. International investors are far more worried about what might happen in the second round of the French elections on Sunday than they were about the outcome in the UK.\n\nThe second reason there was only the slightest of reaction to the biggest Conservative defeat in history is that the markets think little will change. The small opening rise in the FTSE 100 index of leading London shares was led by housebuilders in anticipation of changes to planning law but Labour\u2019s economic plans are modest and cautious. It has ruled out big increases in spending and taxes and will be subject to rules governing how much it can borrow.\n\nThis is neither 1945, when a Labour government came to power on a radical socialist manifesto, nor 2017, when a victory for Jeremy Corbyn certainly would have caused a stir in the markets. Rachel Reeves has spent a lot of time convincing the City that she will be a safe pair of hands as chancellor and it has paid off.\n\nThe final reason for the serene response in the markets to Labour\u2019s win is the belief that the worst is over for the economy. A global pandemic and the energy crisis prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have meant the period since 2019 has been something of an economic horror show.\n\nThe Conservatives have been severely punished for presiding over the highest inflation in 40 years, the higher mortgage rates that resulted from Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous premiership, and for living standards being lower at the end of the last parliament than they were at its start. Without question, the election was a rejection of the Conservatives rather than a strong endorsement for Labour.\n\nThe scars from the coronavirus pandemic have not yet fully healed but the impact of the cost of living crisis is fading. Growth is picking up and inflation is back to its 2% target. Real incomes are rising and the Bank of England will soon start to cut interest rates, perhaps as early as next month.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Opinion polls have shown the party heading for one of the largest majorities in modern political history.\n\nAnything other than a resounding Labour victory would have been a major shock after predictions among City traders for a night of relative calm on the currency markets, with dealing rooms across the Square Mile focused not on whether the party would win but on the scale of Starmer\u2019s landslide.\n\nAhead of official results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, the exit poll suggested Labour was on course to win a majority of 170.\n\nStarmer\u2019s expected majority is likely to solidify financial market expectations for a period of stability in British politics after years of turmoil under the Conservatives since the 2016 Brexit vote, when the shock leave outcome triggered a crash in the pound.\n\nAfter four prime ministers in five years, sterling has recovered from a record low of $1.03 in 2022, when Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget triggered a meltdown in financial markets that required the Bank of England to intervene to prevent pension funds from going bust. The pound had been one of the strongest-performing currencies across major economies in recent weeks in anticipation of the result.\n\nThe pound remained steady after the publication of exit polls on Thursday, with sterling trading unchanged on levels earlier in the day at about $1.27.\n\nLabour under Starmer has also shifted to the economic centre ground, aiming to distance the party from the more radical policies of Jeremy Corbyn after the former leader suffered a heavy defeat to Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories in 2019.\n\nAnalysts said a Labour majority below triple digits could have drawn a reaction in financial markets. Traders were also focused on whether Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party might win a sizeable number of seats, as a potential indicator of future political pressures on Starmer over the EU and immigration. The exit poll predicted that Reform would win 13 seats.\n\nStarmer has sought to maintain a cautious approach to economic policy after Labour\u2019s 2019 defeat, when Corbyn promised a far-reaching transformation of the economy, and after Truss\u2019s ill-fated economic experiment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "Is Shein really worth \u00a350bn? Reasons to be sceptical are piling up",
        "body": "A stock market listing for Shein has been talked about for so long that the round number of \u00a350bn has become attached to this Chinese-founded fast-fashion retailer as a plausible valuation. It\u2019s probably time to ask: are you sure about that number?\n\nThe figure isn\u2019t plucked out of thin air, it should be said. Shein raised money from private equity backers last year at a valuation of $66bn, which is roughly \u00a350bn. But, since the company also raised a few dollars at a $100bn valuation the previous year, it has merely demonstrated the standard truth that valuations set in thin private markets can be volatile and are not to be relied upon. Translating a sketchy private number into a hard valuation on a serious public market is a different game.\n\nThen consider what has happened since those fundraisings. For starters, Shein has failed to get itself listed in the US, seemingly because of opposition from US lawmakers. London is now the likely destination \u2013 initial papers have been filed with the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 but the label of being a New York reject, you would think, would knock a few quid off the price.\n\nNow comes something potentially far more serious. The EU is drawing up plans to impose custom duties on cheap goods imported from China and seems to have Shein \u2013 plus the likes of fellow marketplaces Temu and AliExpress \u2013 in mind.\n\nThe threshold for the levy in the EU is \u20ac150 (\u00a3127) and was probably set at that level because of the administrative hassle of chasing small sums. But, given the explosive growth in such sub-\u20ac150 parcels, there is a fair argument that the retail market is now being distorted and it has become worthwhile for the authorities to pursue duties on packets now deemed \u201cde minimis\u201d. Why should Chinese-based retailers, dispatching orders in small packets to get under the duty threshold, while also enjoying subsidised postage costs in China, enjoy such an advantage?\n\nThe same argument is running in the UK, where the threshold is \u00a3135. Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, this week called for loopholes to be closed for \u201csome of the businesses that aren\u2019t paying tax in the right way, so it\u2019s a level playing field for everybody\u201d. Absolutely right: the rules need a fundamental rethink.\n\nAn open question is how far Shein\u2019s business model would be damaged if custom duties had to be paid. Donald Tang, Shein\u2019s executive chair, has argued in the past that the firm embraces reform in the name of \u201cfair competition around the world\u201d and has claimed tax breaks are \u201cnot foundational to our success.\u201d Outside investors, one suspects, would want to see detailed evidence to support the latter claim. The core pitch to consumers is that the clothes are dirt-cheap; the customs duty advantage does not feel irrelevant.\n\nIn the meantime, the guessing-game on valuation must proceed on the basis of little detailed information. The Singapore-domiciled Shein drones on about how it uses AI to predict demand, how it ships to 150 countries and how it keeps waste to a minimum, but it is less forthcoming about financial performance.\n\nThe FT reported that it had seen a financing document showing $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in profits for 2023 and roughly $45bn (\u00a335bn) in gross merchandise value, but audited numbers are what count in a listing document and for valuation purposes. Even before one considers the controversy around alleged labour malpractices, some scepticism is required around the \u00a350bn valuation. Shein is big, but it has barely started to explain its business meaningfully.",
        "summary": "A stock market listing for Shein has been talked about for so long that the round number of \u00a350bn has become attached to this Chinese-founded fast-fashion retailer as a plausible valuation.\nShein raised money from private equity backers last year at a valuation of $66bn, which is roughly \u00a350bn.\nTranslating a sketchy private number into a hard valuation on a serious public market is a different game.\nFor starters, Shein has failed to get itself listed in the US, seemingly because of opposition from US lawmakers.\nEven before one considers the controversy around alleged labour malpractices, some scepticism is required around the \u00a350bn valuation.",

        "body": "The EU is moving forward with plans to impose customs duty on cheap goods in a shift that could hit imports from online retailers and harm a hoped-for London listing by the fast-fashion seller Shein.\n\nThe potential change comes amid growing disquiet among retailers based in mainland Europe, the UK and the US about rising competition from the Chinese-linked marketplaces Shein and Temu, which exploit a loophole that excludes low-value items from import duty.\n\nIn the EU, the threshold for the levy is \u20ac150 (\u00a3127) and in the UK it is \u00a3135, enabling retailers such as Shein to ship products directly from overseas to shoppers in those markets without paying any import duty. In the UK, items valued at \u00a339 or less also do not attract import VAT.\n\nSubsidised postage costs in China make it more cost-effective for businesses based there to send cheap goods by air.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said: \u201cIn May last year we put on the table customs reforms for a simple, smarter and safer customs union. What we have proposed now is there is no exemption any more for packages valued at below \u20ac150.\u201d\n\nThe e-commerce proposal must first be discussed and accepted by the European parliament, which sits again later this month.\n\nLast year, 2.3bn items below the duty-free \u20ac150 threshold were imported into the EU, according to a report in the Financial Times that highlighted the potential change.\n\nJohn Stevenson, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said that the impact of a change in the rules on Shein \u201cwould be huge depending on the territory\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Shein logo and web shop. Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/Reuters\n\nSome countries imposed import duties of up to 30%, he said, and having to pay that would force Shein to either completely change its business model, put up prices or take a hit on profit.\n\n\u201cThe whole model is based on not paying duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have a massive impact.\u201d\n\nStevenson was quite sceptical that EU countries would be able to close the loophole in the short term, given the complexity and cost of checking billions of parcels.\n\nHowever, he said the issue would be high on investors\u2019 list of concerns alongside potential ethical issues in its supply chain if Shein went ahead with launching a London listing, as is expected as early as this autumn.\n\nShein also faces increased competition from fellow social media-driven retailers including TikTok Shop and Temu, as well as the post-Covid return to the high street by shoppers, which has helped the likes of Primark.\n\nResearch from Earnest Analytics found that Shein shoppers in the US allocated 43% of their online discount spending to the brand last month compared with 66% a year ago, just before TikTok transactions began.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, some financial planners have said their wealthy clients are selling assets and property in the fear that Labour could increase capital gains tax.\n\nThe reading on the S&P Global services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) slowed from 52.9 in May to 52.1 in June, its lowest reading since November but revised up from a preliminary estimate of 51.2.

        "body": "A landslide victory for Keir Starmer in the general election on Thursday could hand Britain a stability premium in global markets, boosting the pound, shares and investment in the UK at a time of mounting political turmoil elsewhere, City investors have said.\n\nIn sharp contrast with Conservative party warnings over the dangers of a large Labour majority, analysts in the City of London said the prospect of a resounding mandate for Starmer\u2019s party could secure Britain\u2019s \u201csafe haven\u201d status among investors in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nAfter failing to close the gap in opinion polls during the election campaign, Rishi Sunak made a last-ditch warning that a Starmer \u201csupermajority\u201d would \u201cbankrupt people in every generation\u201d.\n\nHowever, City analysts said a Labour landslide could pave the way for global investment in Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty since the 2016 Brexit referendum under the Tories, which had clouded the prospects for international investors.\n\nHighlighting mounting political instability on both sides of the Atlantic and the meltdown in financial markets triggered by Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget \u2013 when investors spoke of a \u201cmoron premium\u201d for Britain \u2013 City experts said a clear outcome on Thursday could return Britain to a steadier footing.\n\nNuwan Goonetilleke, the head of shareholder assets at Phoenix Group, which manages more than \u00a3280bn in investments, said money was already pouring into London-listed assets in anticipation of a Labour victory.\n\n\u201cThe UK is really being seen not just as a safe haven, but the safest of havens \u2013 especially in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the previous gyrations seen in the markets, whether that\u2019s Liz Truss or the leftwing policies from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour in 2019, we\u2019re not really seeing any of those wild swings now. That tells you how far the UK has come from Brexit when there were huge unknowns priced-in for the UK.\n\n\u201cWith a Labour majority, it continues to really double down on that promise of economic stability, growth and wealth creation.\u201d\n\nThe pound has rallied against the euro on global currency markets since Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in France in early June, in a development opening the door to a possible far-right victory or hung parliament in one of the EU\u2019s most powerful economies.\n\nJoshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said: \u201cGiven the political shockwaves being felt around Europe, the prospect of a stable political environment could yet help place the UK economy as a haven for years to come.\u201d\n\nWhile UK government bond yields have remained stable in recent weeks, French borrowing costs have risen sharply. Investors said uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election in November had also bolstered UK assets.\n\nAny other result than a clear Labour victory would come as a shock in City dealing rooms after failure by Sunak to close a 20-point gap in opinion polls, which show the Conservatives on track for the party\u2019s worst defeat since at least 1906.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, some party insiders believe ditching Corbyn-era policies is important for wooing swing voters and tackling accusations of fiscal incompetence that have clung to the party since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Labour leader and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also argue that restoring political stability after years of Tory infighting \u2013 leading the party to its fourth prime minister since 2016 \u2013 could reinvigorate private investment in Britain, helping to meet his growth ambitions without the need for large tax rises or additional government borrowing.\n\nWhile Sunak has argued \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d taken under his premiership have helped the economy to \u201cturn a corner,\u201d which could enable interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, opinion polls suggest many voters are refusing to give him much credit after 14 years of Tory rule.\n\nMichael Browne, chief investment officer at the asset manager Martin Currie, said Britain\u2019s economy and financial markets could benefit from a period of stability under a Labour government that was \u201cmore moderate and international in tone\u201d.\n\nHe said the situation was comparable to 1997 when UK government bonds and sterling rallied in anticipation of Tony Blair\u2019s landslide victory. \u201cTo quote a well-known campaign slogan from 1997: \u2018Things can only get better.\u2019 With the current backdrop we would like to think so for the UK\u2019s equity assets.\u201d",
        "summary": "However, City analysts said a Labour landslide could pave the way for global investment in Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty since the 2016 Brexit referendum under the Tories, which had clouded the prospects for international investors.\nNuwan Goonetilleke, the head of shareholder assets at Phoenix Group, which manages more than \u00a3280bn in investments, said money was already pouring into London-listed assets in anticipation of a Labour victory.\nThat tells you how far the UK has come from Brexit when there were huge unknowns priced-in for the UK.\nInvestors said uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election in November had also bolstered UK assets.\nHe said the situation was comparable to 1997 when UK government bonds and sterling rallied in anticipation of Tony Blair\u2019s landslide victory.",

        "title": "Labour is putting its plans for Britain in the hands of private finance. It could end badly | Daniela Gabor",
        "body": "The Labour party has a plan for returning to power: it will get BlackRock to rebuild Britain. Its reasoning is straightforward. A cash-strapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance, attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of Tory underinvestment. Labour has already done the arithmetic: to mobilise \u00a33 of private capital from institutional investors, you need to offer them \u00a31 in public subsidies. But every time you hear Labour announce such an infrastructure partnership, think of the hidden politics. BlackRock will privatise Britain \u2013 our housing, education, health, nature and green energy \u2013 with our taxpayer money as sweetener.\n\nBlackRock has long peddled the idea of public-private partnerships for infrastructure, climate and development. Yet its political momentum has recently accelerated. When its chair, Larry Fink, the world\u2019s most powerful financier, sat with world leaders at the G7 summit last month, he promised the following: rich countries need growth, infrastructure investment can deliver that growth, but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated $75tn (\u00a359tn) necessary by 2040. Trillions, however, are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions (BlackRock, the largest of these firms, manages about $10tn, as a shrinking welfare state pushes us \u2013 future pensioners \u2013 into its arms).\n\nIf governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can\u2019t it deploy trillions without the government\u2019s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.\n\nBut for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to \u201cderisk\u201d investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.\n\nThe choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords \u2013 the most prominent being Blackstone, the private equity fund \u2013 can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about \u00a31.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.\n\nLook behind Blackstone\u2019s returns \u2013 which come from rents and rising house prices \u2013 and you will find the state\u2019s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support \u2013 such as housing benefit \u2013 that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we\u2019re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.\n\nLabour\u2019s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer\u2019s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to \u201chow do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?\u201d This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn\u2019t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.\n\nAlready, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure \u2013 though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer\u2019s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people\u2019s living standards.\n\nInstead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What\u2019s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.\n\nDaniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol",

        "body": "Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month.\n\nAnnual inflation in consumer prices across the 20-country bloc eased from 2.6% in May, according to a flash estimate from the EU statistical agency Eurostat, matching financial market expectations.\n\nHowever, core inflation \u2013 which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 remained unchanged at 2.9%, marginally higher than predicted by economists in a reflection of stubborn inflationary pressures.\n\nAnalysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June.\n\n\u201cNothing in these figures would make the ECB cut again in July, and we think it\u2019ll be eagerly awaiting data over the summer before seriously debating a next rate cut in September,\u201d said Bert Colijn, the senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING.\n\n\u201cThe summer is set to be relatively boring [for the ECB]. It can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth. It can also see how market turmoil around the French elections plays out.\u201d\n\nIn its flash estimate for June, Eurostat figures showed services had the highest annual inflation rate at 4.1%, a stable rate compared with May. Annual price growth for food, alcohol and tobacco slowed from 2.6% in May to 2.5%.\n\nRiccardo Marcelli Fabiani, a senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cInflation resumed its descent after it had been temporarily interrupted in May, and it will continue to fall as inflationary pressures wane thanks to easing wage growth, lower energy prices and normalised price expectations. But core inflation remaining stable reminds us that the disinflationary process will be bumpy.\u201d\n\nThe ECB cut its main deposit rate last month to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. It was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years.\n\nHowever, the central bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent, with a robust labour market and resilient wage growth.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "summary": "Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month.\nAnalysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June.\nIt can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth.\nIt was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years.\nA second rate cut \u201cfeels ambitious\u201d, he said.",

        "body": "Economic growth will bring prosperity to all. This is the mantra that guides the decision-making of the vast majority of politicians, economists and even human rights bodies.\n\nYet the reality \u2013 as detailed in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council this month \u2013 shows that while poverty eradication has historically been promised through the \u201ctrickling down\u201d or \u201credistribution\u201d of wealth, economic growth largely \u201cgushes up\u201d to a privileged few.\n\nIn the past four years alone the world\u2019s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty in 2030 \u2013 the deadline set by the world\u2019s governments to eradicate it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to social protection.\n\nHundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive in a world that has never been wealthier; many are driven to exhaustion in poorly paid, often dangerous jobs to satisfy the needs of the elite and to boost corporate profits. In low-income countries, where significant investment is still required, growth can still serve a useful role. In practice, however, it is often extractive, relying on the exploitation of a cheap workforce and the plundering of natural resources.\n\nConcrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product\n\nThe endless quest for growth at all costs, and the escalating use of the natural resources it demands, is pushing our planet way beyond its limits. Six of the nine \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d \u2013 Earth\u2019s life-support systems \u2013 have already been crossed. For too long, the health of our planet has been sacrificed for inequitable material gain.\n\nOur economies are failing us. We urgently need to look beyond profit, beyond the short term and beyond the interests of the few.\n\nA \u201chuman rights economy\u201d can deliver for people and the planet because it shifts our focus from growth to humanity \u2013 grounding the purpose of the economy in fundamental, universal human values. It offers human rights as a guardrail to keep the economy on track \u2013 meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities and eradicating poverty.\n\nThis proposition is not some fairytale. Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 which tells us nothing about the ecological or social fallout of economic activity.\n\nAnd we need to start valuing what really counts. GDP has no way of accounting for the estimated 16.4bn hours spent every day worldwide on unpaid work, largely carried out by women, that underpins the global economy: caring for children, people with disabilities and older citizens.\n\nUnpaid domestic and care work should be remunerated through paid parental and carers\u2019 leave, included in pension calculations, and supported through access to safe water, sanitation, affordable childcare facilities and other essential services.\n\nFinancing these services while reducing our dependence on GDP growth is achievable through progressive tax policies such as inheritance and wealth taxes, preventing illegal financial flows and tax evasion, and tackling corruption. More effective international cooperation on tax, debt and social protection is also needed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet a growing movement is rallying against our growth-driven economic model: climate activists, workers and trade unions, scientists and academics, young people, environmental and human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples, progressive economists, and activists fighting inequality, gender disparities and colonialism are speaking out.\n\nAs world leaders prepare to gather for the Summit of the Future in September \u2013 a UN initiative that aims to forge a global consensus around what our future should look like \u2013 this groundswell of support for an alternative vision of progress must be embraced. Without a roadmap for a global economy that protects human rights, including the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the final document leaders agree in New York will continue to lead us down the path to extinction.",

The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still \u201ctoo expensive\u201d in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nAccording to the RAC\u2019s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p.\n\n\u201cFuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,\u201d the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe RAC\u2019s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nHe said prices at forecourts owned and run by Shell and BP were the most expensive, highlighting Competition and Markets Authority data showing that Shell-owned sites were the most expensive in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe remain baffled how the very same fuel can be sold for such vastly different prices by the biggest retailers, whether they\u2019re run by supermarkets or the world\u2019s largest oil companies,\u201d he said.\n\nRishi Sunak has made lower inflation the cornerstone of the Conservatives\u2019 general election campaign after a return in the official headline rate to the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% in May, down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nThe shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, however, has said pressure on household finances remains \u201cacute\u201d as average prices remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The figures suggest average prices in UK shops are continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.\n\nThe chief executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said retailers had, however, cut the prices of some key products including butter and coffee. Non-food prices were also in deflation \u2013 meaning average prices are falling compared with a year earlier \u2013 as shops tried to boost their sales by discounting products.\n\n\u201cThis was particularly true for TVs with great deals to capitalise on the Euros fever,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever wins Thursday\u2019s election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.\u201d",

        "body": "Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity.\n\nAfter outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent\u2019s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as \u201cbarbaric\u201d by unions, takes effect from Monday.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy. \u201cWhen almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.\u201d\n\nThe pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation \u2013 part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year \u2013 Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009.\n\nThe six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage.\n\nEither choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work.\n\n\u201cThe nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,\u201d Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. \u201cAnd it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required.\n\nFor opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers\u2019 rights in the name of flexibility.\n\n\u201cIn reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,\u201d said Sotiropoulos. \u201cBetter productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.\u201d\n\nThe measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country\u2019s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff.\n\nTrialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada.\n\nGreeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less.

        "body": "Nick Hartley, who has died aged 80, was a respected economist and in the 1990s served as head of energy, economics and statistics at the Department of Trade and Industry.\n\nHis reputation was made as chief economist at Oftel (the Office of Telecommunications) for six years from 1984. He was then chief economist at the Department of the Environment (1990-94), before becoming head of energy, economics and statistics at the DTI, a post, he liked to point out, once held by Harold Wilson. In 1996, Nick joined the economic consultancy Oxera, from where he was seconded to the Cabinet Office to head up a report on energy policy.\n\nBorn in London, the only child of Nancy (nee Fulton), a dressmaker, and Edward Hartley, a publican, Nick went to St Clement Danes grammar school, Hammersmith, where he and I met in 1955. Sitting side by side in assembly for the headteacher\u2019s address to the new boys, he introduced himself: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Hartley, like the jam.\u201d\n\nIn the sixth form we were told by our economics teacher, Jack Harvey, to apply to St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, to study economics. We arrived in 1962 during a winter so cold that the River Granta froze, and Nick and I would walk on it to Grantchester.\n\nAfter graduating, Nick passed the civil service exam and became assistant principal at the Department for Education, where he worked for JAR Pimlott setting up polytechnics (1965-69). From there, he moved to the Treasury as an economic adviser (1969-84). He was seconded from the Treasury twice, in 1970-71 to do an MPhil at York University, and in 1974-77, to the Royal Commission on the Press.\n\nLatterly he was a companion of the Guild of St George, a charity for arts and crafts founded by John Ruskin who, Nick said, \u201cwas asking all the right questions about the way work and society should be organised\u201d. Nick travelled throughout Italy with Ruskin\u2019s work in mind, and artistic interests were central to his life.\n\nHe wrote several books, including The Prince of Privateers (2012), a life of one of his forebears who was on the British side in the American war of independence, and Monuments Officer (2012), a novel.\n\nAn enthusiastic theatregoer, as an undergraduate he played Lucky in a production of Waiting for Godot. After hearing Bob Dylan\u2019s second album in 1962 he became a lifelong fan of the musician. He was also a keen reader of the magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, so after watching a film at Cambridge, whether Hammer horror or Truffaut, he would give notes on \u201cauteur theory\u201d.\n\nThe novelist and playwright Nigel Williams described Nick as having a \u201cunique brisk theatricality\u201d. Perfect words with which to preserve my own memories of him, particularly as the briskness often involved the sort of expansive gestures that put any wine glasses on a table at risk.\n\nNick is survived by Jenny (nee Stern), whom he married in 1975, and by their sons, Ned and Gabriel, and granddaughters, Violet, Hazel and Hana.",

        "body": "Paul Krugman (How the \u2018unforced error\u2019 of austerity wrecked Britain, 28 June) hits the nail on the head when he says that there was no economic case for the austerity that the coalition government foisted on us in 2010, the effects of which are still with us. It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour.\n\nThe American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned.\n\nProf Roger Brown\n\nSouthampton\n\nPaul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy \u2013 here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too.\n\nSecond, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector\u2019s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector.\n\nAlternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both.\n\nAusterity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we\u2019ve suffered from the consequences ever since.\n\nDave Pollard\n\nLeicester\n\nPaul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy. But in solely blaming the Tories, he neglects to acknowledge the role of the Liberal Democrats in both enabling austerity and even co-authoring the genesis of the policy through the key role played by the then chief secretary to the Treasury David Laws.\n\nAlthough in post for only a short time, his role was pivotal in developing the first drastic cuts in public expenditure. We now live with the consequences of 14 years of monetarist dogma ruthlessly, pitilessly and unfairly applied.\n\nAlan Beynon\n\nBarmby Moor, East Yorkshire",

Boeing has announced the takeover of Spirit Aerosystems as it tries to retake control of its supply chain following a series of production issues. As part of that deal Airbus will take over Spirit operations serving it, including in Belfast which makes wings and fuselages for the small A220 jet. However, the Unite union has said that 40% of the 3,600 workforce is employed on parts that are not related to Airbus projects, including work for Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. Airbus did not say whether it plans to continue that work. Local politicians are concerned that job losses may result at an historic factory that traces its history back to Short Brothers, the first company to make production aircraft. First minister Michelle O\u2019Neill and deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly released statements in which they said the government was working with the company to preserve the Belfast operations. Economy minister Conor Murphy said: \u201cI have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.\u201d Reuters reported: The leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s (DUP) Gavin Robinson, said the sale represented only \u201ca partial solution\u201d. Steve Aiken, a member of the smaller Ulster Unionist Party, said it was an outcome \u201cneither management, workforce or the unions desired\u201d, calling on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy minister to intervene to ensure the entire business is retained. \u201cThe minister also needs to emphasis to Airbus the considerable investment the Northern Irish and UK governments have made in wing and aerostructure manufacturing in Belfast and that we will not be allowing our aircraft industry to be asset stripped and manufacturing moved elsewhere,\u201d Aiken added. Share\n\n6d ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation \u201cremains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta has breached the EU\u2019s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a \u201cpay or consent\u201d model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc\u2019s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into \u201cpay or consent\u201d on Monday and found the model \u201cforces users to consent\u201d to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the \u201cwith adverts\u201d versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term \u2013 although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn.

Photograph: Jacob King/PA Sharon Graham, Unite\u2019s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share\n\n6d ago 12.59 CEST Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July \u2013 after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite\u2019s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May.

The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May\u2019s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May\u2019s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers\u2019 input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA It\u2019s a big news day for what remains of Northern Irish manufacturing: first, we had the news that Airbus will take over the historic Shorts aerospace operation from Spirit Aerosystems. And now there are renewed questions over the future of the nearby Harland & Wolff site, after its shares were suspended on the London\u2019s junior stock market. It has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time, the Guardian\u2019s Jack Simpson reports. It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point. The Belfast-based shipbuilder was plunged into uncertainty last month when it was reported that the UK government was witholding the approval of a \u00a3200m loan guarantee promised in December to shore up its finances.

That is still a notable move, but less than the nearly 3% surge earlier. The euro is up by 0.5% today against the US dollar at $1.0766. A hung parliament would make it more difficult for either the far-right National Rally (RN) or the leftwing New Popular Front coalition to win a majority and increase spending.

Fellow co-chair Debbie Wosskow said: A female chancellor, one of the highest offices in the country, who has already vowed to put women at the heart of economic plans, is so vital. A female chancellor who also recognises the billions that female entrepreneurs could add to Britain\u2019s economy is even better. Reeves has already vowed to close the gender pay gap once and for all, and to make flexible working the norm. These are structural drivers of inequality that should be addressed at a policy level and will play an integral part in allowing women to embrace entrepreneurship. For the most effective change, though, we need to enable a new era of public and private sector collaboration. Just 2% of capital investment goes into all-female founded teams in the UK, and we need to break this decades-long cycle. This is exactly what the taskforce exists to do and, by working with the new chancellor, we will make great strides this year and put the UK on the map for female entrepreneurs. Share\n\n2d ago 17.29 CEST Jasper Jolly Former Nissan and Aston Martin executive Andy Palmer has said that the Labour party could signal a new phase for the UK automotive industry. Palmer was chief operating officer at Japanese carmaker Nissan, bringing mass manufacturing of electric cars to the UK for the first time. He then led British sportscar maker Aston Martin until 2020. He said he hoped a stable government could attract more inward investment from major companies to build in the UK. He said: I\u2019m no politician, but I am an auto guy, an industry guy. What I saw over the last five years was a disengagement with industry and business. I woke up today with probably a greater sense of optimism for an awful long time, at least in that I\u2019m pretty sure the Labour party will listen to autos and business. Palmer said he believed that the UK needs more battery manufacturing. He is now chair of a Slovakian battery company, Inobat, which could potentially benefit from government support if it were to invest in the UK. We\u2019ve fallen behind dramatically in that green revolution. We need to grasp it. Share Updated at 17.30 CEST\n\n2d ago 17.02 CEST Reeves has a tough task on her hands. Andrew Hunter, a senior economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the Labour may soon have to choose between higher taxes, higher borrowing or spending cuts. The new Labour government has an historically strong electoral mandate, but will still need to tread a fine line between enacting the required spending and reforms to improve public services and revitalise the economy, and maintaining the confidence of financial markets. Moreover, these challenges come at a time when the economy already faces a variety of other risks, including from geopolitical tensions or the possibility that persistent inflation could warrant interest rates staying high for longer than currently assumed. Attracting sufficient levels of private-sector capital through their green investment plans will likely to be key to Labour\u2019s hopes for a sustained resurgence in economic growth. But, while there is an upside risk that this succeeds and helps drive a sustained improvement in the economy\u2019s supply side performance over the coming years, it is not our current baseline forecast.

Will it work? Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, an alternative stock exchange focused on smaller companies, said: The first thing they\u2019ve got to do is gain the confidence of the City. The first 100 days is really going to matter. Reeves has \u201cdone a good job so far\u201d of reassuring the City with her pitch of stability, said Haynes. However, he said he wanted the government to offer more help to growing companies, and incentives to keep them in the UK rather than going elsewhere. He would particularly like the extension of the enterprise investment scheme, a tax break for investors, to companies that are growing quickly (including many that are listed on his exchange). However, Haynes is sceptical about plans to raise taxes that would hit some of the City\u2019s wealthiest, such as abolishing a loophole that allows private equity bosses to pay capital gains tax on earnings rather than higher income tax, abolishing the tax break for non-domiciled people, and taxing private schools. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help when you read things in the Guardian about putting up capital gains tax,\u201d said Haynes. \u201cThat kills entrepreneurship.

When revenues stagnate, cost cutting takes over. For years now it feels like we\u2019ve been trying to shrink to greatness and it\u2019s time to change course. We urgently need to invest. In our public services, in infrastructure, in our schools and universities and in housing. Our new government must foster productivity, encouraging regulators to facilitate real competition and holding businesses to account for their failures. It must encourage banks to support SMEs and drive out complacency about falling service standards. Real competition leads to better customer outcomes. When it comes to employee welfare, companies should be encouraged to follow the data and not the dogma. Happy and healthy colleagues are good for business. And our path to net zero can either be a burden or an opportunity. We should make it the latter and incentivise companies to invest in renewables and in a sustainable future. A new government and prime minister offers us a rare opportunity to re-boot UK plc. We must seize it with both hands. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of insurance marketplace Lloyd\u2019s, said: Lloyd\u2019s looks forward to partnering with the new UK Government to generate growth and to build resilience into our economy. Our role is to provide critical solutions to support disaster resilience, insuring the transition and bringing global investment to the UK. We look to the government to bring a period of greater stability and to enact reforms necessary to improve the economy\u2019s competitiveness.

Bosses in the financial sector have called on the new Labour government to boost investment and increase productivity after the sweeping win under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, write Kalyeena Makortoff and Jasper Jolly. The financial industry is one of the UK\u2019s key sectors, accounting for about one in every 12 pounds generated by the British economy. Labour described financial services in its manifesto as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s greatest success stories\u201d, and has pledged to bring forward public-private partnerships to fund investments in infrastructure. Here is what some of the City\u2019s bosses had to say. Andrea Rossi, chief executive of investment manager M&G, said: With over 12 million people in the UK seeking assistance to achieve financial security and the UK\u2019s financial advice gap widening (only 9% of Brits currently have access to advice), we would want to see any new government implementing policies that encourage long term savings and support better retirement outcomes. There is currently an acute set of societal challenges and barriers to saving for many, with the cost-of-living crisis drastically reducing disposable incomes. We\u2019d look to work with the next government and the wider financial services industry to provide more opportunity for savers to benefit from financial products that meet their investment needs. As a member of Labour\u2019s British Infrastructure Council I look forward to working with the government to unlock private investment to boost infrastructure investment in the UK. Private-public investment initiatives will be key in getting capital to sustainable British real estate and infrastructure projects that can position the UK for sustainable growth. Share Updated at 15.04 CEST\n\n2d ago 14.55 CEST Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist, said despite June\u2019s forecast-beating 206,000 gain in non-farm payrolls, overall this was a \u201cdisappointing\u201d report given the total 111,000 downward revisions to past months and the further rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, \u201cwhich puts us one step closer to triggering the Sahm rule on recessions\u201d. That 206,000 gain was also not nearly as good as it looks at first glance, with 70,000 coming from government jobs. Of the 136,00 increase in private payrolls, health care and social assistance accounted for 82,000 of those additional jobs. That suggests cyclical employment increased by only around 50,000, adding to the evidence of weakness in GDP growth, he said. Admittedly, the rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, from 4.0%, was for the \u201cright\u201d reasons, with a 277,000 increase in the labour force eclipsing a muted 116,000 increase in the household survey measure of employment. That means we\u2019re getting closer to triggering the so-called Sahm rule, although since the rate is being driven up mainly by strong labour supply rather than weak labour demand, we would caution against relying on it too heavily in what has been a unique cycle in many respects. Share Updated at 14.58 CEST\n\n2d ago 14.44 CEST The 206,000 increase in employment in June was similar to the average monthly gain of 220,000 over the past year, the bureau said. Government employment rose by 70,000 in June, higher than the average monthly gain of 49,000 over the past 12 months. Healthcare added 49,000 jobs, lower than the average monthly gain of 64,000 over the prior 12 months. Employment in social assistance increased by 34,000 in June, primarily in individual and family services (+26,000). Construction added 27,000 jobs in June, higher than the average monthly gain of 20,000 over the past year.

        "body": "3d ago 15.34 CEST Energy commodity trading in muted reaction to prospect of Labour victory Jillian Ambrose The muted market reaction to the prospect of a Labour party victory in the UK\u2019s general election is evident even in energy commodity markets today, where traders are not expecting to be caught out by any surprises. \u201cElection results look quite certain,\u201d one trader told the Guardian. \u201cCommodity traders won\u2019t be working past 5pm.\u201d The potential for Labour\u2019s manifesto points to translate into price movements appears limited, according to Robbie Jackson-Stroud, an analyst at commodities data provider ICIS. Jackson-Stroud said that any policies designed to spur the development and construction of new energy capacity requires time to agree upon at a policy level, as well as planning and then construction. He added that \u201ccost constraints in the current climate are the driver of investment in renewable capacity, and a change of party does not shift that.\u201d But the commodity market\u2019s underwhelming response to a potential Labour government has had one exception: the UK\u2019s market for carbon credits. Traders have placed record bets that the price of UK carbon allowances, known as UKAs, would rise on the basis that a future Labour government would bring in tougher climate policies making it more expensive to pollute. \u201cUKA prices have already rallied on expectation of improved green policies and the possibility that the UK\u2019s carbon market may link with the EU market under a Labour government,\u201d the trader said. The benchmark UKA price climbed to highs of \u00a350 a tonne in the weeks after the election was announced, from lows of \u00a331 a tonne earlier this year. On Thursday the price reached an intra-day high of \u00a346.30 a tonne. Share\n\n3d ago 15.17 CEST The 4.2% drop in the Novo Nordisk share price this week has wiped nearly \u00a315bn off its market value, reducing it to \u00a3370bn. The success of its weight loss treatments has turned it into Denmark\u2019s, and Europe\u2019s, most valuable company. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis has also looked at the eye study. Whilst the paper in question does indeed suggest some correlation with a rare ocular event, the quality of the evidence is very low, the error bars are very wide, we note the lack of prior identification suggests this would be a relatively rare issue (far rarer than stats in this paper would imply\u2026) and the worst case scenario would likely be a further update to the label warning section \u2013 hardly a game-changer. As an aside, we also remain relaxed on the pricing outlook, within the context of the damage that has already been done by the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. Share Updated at 15.17 CEST\n\n3d ago 15.01 CEST Shares in Novo Nordisk, and US rival Eli Lilly, have also come under pressure after Joe Biden attacked the company\u2019s pricing for weight loss drugs this week. The companies are charging \u201cunconscionably high prices\u201d that are above those paid in other countries, Biden wrote in an editorial with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders published in USA Today on Tuesday. If \u201cpharmaceutical companies refuse to substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country and end their greed, we will do everything within our power to end it for them,\u201d they wrote. Share Updated at 15.02 CEST\n\n3d ago 14.23 CEST Novo Nordisk shares fall 4.2% after eye study Shares in Novo Nordisk, the maker of the bestselling diabetes and weight loss injections Ozempic and Wegovy, have fallen more than 4% this week, after a study suggested that there could be a link between those treatments and vision loss. The shares are down 4.2% so far this week, but have somewhat recovered to trade 0.8% higher today. People who have been prescribed a weight-loss injection could be at a higher risk of developing an eye condition which can lead to blindness, the study found. The study, published yesterday, found that people with diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide, most commonly known under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, were more than four times more likely to be diagnosed with an eye condition known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (naion). Naion is a disorder in which the arteries which supply blood to the optic nerve in the eye become blocked. The condition can lead to loss of eyesight due to the optic nerve being deprived of oxygen and subsequently damaged. There is no known treatment for the condition, which affects 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population. Weight-loss jabs may be linked to condition that can cause blindness, study finds Read more Jakob Westh Christensen, market analyst at eToro said Considering that over 50% of Novo Nordisk\u2019s sales are attributed to these two blockbuster drugs and with a promising projected growth trajectory, any significant issues with the drugs could pose a threat to earnings and stock prices. However, the relatively minor market reaction indicates that investors are not overly concerned about this initial study. With a high valuation at nearly 40 times pprice/earnings, it is evident that the market has great expectations for Novo Nordisk\u2019s earnings growth in the year ahead. This growth is largely based on their GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss treatments, which are currently under scrutiny. This growth journey is supported by yet another uplift to management\u2019s 2024 outlook in connection with Q1-results, which now expects operating profit to grow 22-30%. However, it is important to note that this study is relatively small and has limited statistical power. The findings do not prove that the medications caused the eye complications, which are commonly associated with diabetes. To establish any connection properly, a much larger study must be conducted. As retail investors who hold Novo Nordisk stock, it is advisable to monitor this situation closely. Any significant threat to these highly successful drugs would constitute a significant setback to Novo Nordisk\u2019s growth journey. Share Updated at 15.11 CEST\n\n3d ago 13.51 CEST Russ Mould at AJ Bell has also looked at the medical equipment maker Smith & Nephew, Andy Murray\u2019s artificial hipmaker, which is leading FTSE 100 gains here in London. The shares jumped more than 8% after the activist investor Cevian Capital, a Swedish investment firm, disclosed a stake of around 5%. Activist investors often circle a struggling company so the news Sweden\u2019s Cevian has taken a stake in medical devices firm Smith & Nephew shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise. Cevian has previously taken positions in UBS, Vodafone and Aviva in an attempt to force change and the case for doing so at Smith & Nephew is presented by a near-40% decline in the share price over the last five years. Ian Cowie, columnist at the Sunday Times and interactive investor, said on X: Bargain Britain: Activist Investor Cevian Takes Stake in Smith & Nephew, Andy Murray\u2019s artificial hip-maker. Share price jumps for joy! https://t.co/MdiYfDwi4F \u2014 Ian Cowie (@iancowie) July 4, 2024 The positive share price reaction to Cevian taking a position in Smith & Nephew demonstrates the market thinks an outside catalyst for a shake-up of the business would be no bad thing. The company was severely affected by the pandemic as elective procedures like hip and knee replacements were cancelled, reducing demand for its orthopaedic products. Lockdown also hit the company\u2019s supply chain, as it did for many businesses. However, its post-Covid recovery has been faltering and an improvement plan announced in 2022 has not yet resulted in a material improvement in earnings and profitability. This hasn\u2019t been helped by a weak showing in the US market. Cevian is likely to hold management\u2019s feet to the fire and may look for more ambitious targets than set out under the existing improvement plan. It could also push for a rationalisation of the company\u2019s portfolio, which encompasses sports medicine and wound care alongside orthopaedics.

Photograph: Stephen Dwyer/Alamy Share Updated at 14.13 CEST\n\n3d ago 13.47 CEST Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, has looked at today\u2019s market moves. The FTSE 100 index has gained 80 points to 8251, up nearly 1% on the day, while European shares are also pushing higher. France\u2019s CAC has climbed 0.8% ahead of the second round of elections on Sunday. The FTSE 100 made a strong start on election day but its gains had far more to do with events on the other side of the Atlantic. Broad-based gains across the index followed weak jobs data from the US and a soft reading from the country\u2019s services sector. This was taken as an indication the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates sooner rather than later, with the labour market closely watched by Jerome Powell and his colleagues. The dollar fell which, along with the shifting rate expectations, helped power Asian markets to big gains, with one broad-based Asian index reaching its highest level in more than two years. Dominant regional name Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company traded above one thousand Taiwanese dollars for the first time. Closer to home, there was some relief that mainstream parties appeared to be mounting a concerted effort to thwart the far-right Rassemblement National\u2019s hopes of gaining a majority in the French parliament. Share\n\n3d ago 13.44 CEST Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at the trading platform Capital.com, said if we get a government change after 14 years of Tory leadership as suggested by opinion polls, \u201cthe market reaction is likely to be slightly muted given the outcome is mostly priced in\u201d. The majority of the momentum will come from investors\u2019 perception that the Labour Party can keep to its pledge to keep a lid on public spending and manage the national debt while putting the country back on the path towards stable economic growth. In particular, the plans to increase the supply of housing could benefit FTSE 100-listed housing stocks (Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group, etc.). Turning to the pound, she said: Barring any surprises which could bring volatility to markets, the pound may attempt to build on the pre-election rally of the last two days. But it is likely that it encounters resistance up ahead, especially as the focus remains on the Bank of England and its policy mandate, which has given no clear signs of when it will be able to start cutting rates. Markets are hopeful of a September start, but ongoing concerns about wage pressures in the services sector are keeping the central bank from making a move just yet. How these policy expectations evolve will likely have a bigger impact on the pound in the coming weeks than the election. Overall, the momentum in UK assets should not change much after the UK general election if things go as planned. As we\u2019ve seen from the political turmoil in France, the less political friction there is the better the market will react. There is no denying that a new government will face significant challenges up ahead and that can weigh on UK assets further down the line, but for now, a seemingly calm election should anchor UK stocks and keep the pound relatively calm. Share\n\n3d ago 13.03 CEST UK employers scale back expected wage growth, Bank of England says Employers in the UK expect their wage bills to grow more slowly over the coming 12 months, according to a survey that should give the Bank of England more confidence to cut interest rates in the next few months. The central bank\u2019s own Decision Maker Panel survey showed anticipated year-ahead wage growth fell by 0.3 percentage points to 4.2% in the three months to June. It was the lowest reading since the survey started in May 2022. The official measure of earnings growth has been too high for policymakers\u2019 liking, and also fed into stubbornly high services inflation. But this survey suggests that wage growth could cool in the coming months. Share\n\n3d ago 12.34 CEST EU trade chief: no basis for China to retaliate to new EV tariffs There is no basis for China to retaliate, as the European Union prepares to impose fresh tariffs of up to 37.6% on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said today, in an interview with Bloomberg News. The EU tariffs, which range between 17.4% and 37.6%, will apply from tomorrow, according to EU officials. They are aimed at stemming what European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has described as a flood of cheap Chinese-made EVs built with state subsidies. However, there is a four-month window during which the duties are only provisional and intense talks are expected to continue between the two sides. At the end of the period, the Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, could impose \u201cdefinite duties\u201d that typically apply for five years, on which EU members would vote. Dombrovskis said: Our aim is to\u2026 ensure fair competition and level playing field. Therefore, once again, we do not see any basis for retaliation. Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs. The provisional rates are almost exactly those announced by the Commission on 12 June. Beijing said at the time that it would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to safeguard China\u2019s interests. These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of European products such as cognac and pork. EU to put tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles as trade war looms Read more Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker, is opposed to the tariffs. It said: The timing of the EU Commission\u2019s decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEVs [battery electric vehicles] in Germany and Europe. The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group is confidently accepting growing international competition, including from China, and sees this as an opportunity \u2013 this also benefits our customers. The owner of the Jeep, Fiat and Vauxhall brands, Stellantis, has also come out against the proposed tariffs. Its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has criticised the duties and said the world\u2019s fourth biggest carmaker preferred to \u201cfight to stay competitive\u201d. The Shanghai-based electric carmaker Nio said: At this stage, Nio maintains the pricing of its current models in its European markets. however, it cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed. Despite these developments, Nio is fully committed to the European market: we believe in fostering competition and consumer interest, and we hope to reach a resolution with the EU before definitive measures are enforced in November.

        "body": "The British banking sector has called for the next government to penalise startups that take state aid and then list abroad amid concerns about young companies choosing foreign stock exchanges over London.\n\nUK Finance suggested subsidies and tax breaks could be clawed back, arguing in a paper published this week that companies in receipt of government help should have \u201ca two-way commitment\u201d.\n\nBritish businesspeople and City grandees have said for several years that London\u2019s stock market is in decline relative to other exchanges, notably in the US, where some fast-growing companies have said it is easier to attract investments.\n\nRecent departures from the London Stock Exchange have included the building materials company CRH, the betting company Flutter and the plumbing products company Ferguson. Perhaps most galling for the LSE, however, was the failure to attract the huge flotation of the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, which plumped for New York despite the personal lobbying of Rishi Sunak.\n\nIn a paper co-written by Global Counsel, the lobbying consultancy set up by the former Labour business minister Peter Mandelson, UK Finance suggested commitments to stay in the UK in exchange for government support could help to arrest the movement of companies abroad.\n\n\u201cThe government should also consider ways in which an expanded set of taxpayer-funded supports for early-stage growth companies involve a two-way commitment and would become repayable in part or full if a recipient ultimately chooses to list, or move valuable operations, outside the UK,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cWhere a UK company chooses to join public markets or locate is a choice for the company. However, there is a strong case for linking taxpayer supports to future commitments to using UK public markets and operating in the UK.\u201d\n\nRegulators, politicians and executives have prescribed various remedies for the perceived exodus. The Financial Conduct Authority last year unveiled sweeping reforms to make it easier for startup founders to keep controlling stakes, apeing the US.\n\nThe chief executive of the LSE, Julia Hoggett, argued last year that UK companies were not on a \u201clevel playing field\u201d because British asset managers tended to vote against larger, US-style pay packages.\n\nConor Lawlor, the managing director for capital markets and wholesale policy at UK Finance, said: \u201cWe want to see UK companies grow and be hugely successful. We also want to bolster our capital markets and the number of companies that choose to list on UK markets.

The decline in the ISM services index to 48.8 in June, from 53.8, takes it to its lowest since the lockdowns in 2020. Alongside a decline in the ISM manufacturing index, these surveys suggest that GDP growth will remain weak in the third quarter. They also add to evidence that labour demand is softening, and inflation will remain on a downward trend.

Leading the growth rankings for a second month running was the financials sector, where the rate of expansion in output picked up again to the sharpest since the end of 2021. Although returning to contraction territory for the second time in the last three months, technology firms recorded only a fractional drop in output in June. It was, nonetheless, the worst performing of the seven sectors. In contrast, the healthcare sector returned to growth in June, as output rose for the first time since March. Moreover, the rate of expansion in business activity was solid and the sharpest so far this year. The consumer goods and consumer services sectors saw differing trends during June, as growth in the latter accelerated to the fastest for two years. Meanwhile, consumer goods firms recorded the slowest upturn in output over the past six months. The basic materials sector saw an acceleration in the pace of output growth during June. Production levels rose at a solid rate that was the second-quickest since April 2022 (behind that seen in March 2024). Share\n\n4d ago 15.59 CEST US service sector growth picks up \u2013 S&P Global The US service sector picked up momentum in June, with the biggest rise in new orders in a year. Companies responded by taking on more staff for the first time in three months, but even so backlogs of work built up. Price pressures from both input costs and output prices eased in June, but remained above pre-pandemic averages, mainly because of higher labour costs. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US services PMI business activity index increased for the second month running in June, to 55.3 from 54.8 in May. Activity in the sector has now risen in each of the past 17 months, with the latest expansion the most pronounced since April 2022. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: US service sector companies reported an encouragingly solid end to the second quarter, with output rising at the fastest rate for over two years. Both new order inflows and hiring have also accelerated, the latter buoyed by firms taking on more workers in response to rising backlogs of work. With additional \u2013 albeit more muted \u2013 support coming from the manufacturing sector, the survey data point to GDP rising at an annualised 2.0% rate in the second quarter, with a 2.5% rate seen for June. Forward momentum is therefore gathering pace. There is some nervousness creeping in regarding the post-election business environment, but for now at least confidence about the outlook for the coming year remains elevated by recent standards and supportive of businesses investing in expansion. Some of this optimism relates to ongoing convictions that interest rates will start to fall before the end of the year. In this respect, a further cooling of price pressures in the survey \u2013 notably in the services sector \u2013 adds to signs that inflation should trend lower in the coming months to open the door further for rate cuts. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST\n\n4d ago 15.48 CEST Baillie Gifford-run trust sells Rio Tinto stake An investment trust run by Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford has sold its \u00a320m stake in Rio Tinto, accusing the mining giant of not doing enough to tackle environmental and social concerns. Disclosure of the disposal by the FTSE 250-listed Monks Investment Trust, first reported by the Times, comes weeks after Baillie Gifford came under pressure from environmental activists in a row that led to it pulling out of sponsoring the Hay Edinburgh and other book festivals. Baillie Gifford pulled out after calls by campaign group Fossil Free Books (FFB) for the company to divest from fossil fuels and companies linked to Israel. Nine festivals that were previously sponsored by Baillie Gifford are now seeking donations, we reported earlier this week. Monks said on Tuesday that it would sell shares in companies that are not making enough progress on environmental, social and governance factors and named the mining group as a company it had ditched. Karl Sternberg, chair of Monks, said \u201cconcerns regarding governance and the approach to environmental impact\u201d had not been \u201cadequately addressed\u201d by the world\u2019s second-largest mining group. Monks first voiced concerns over Rio Tinto after it bulldozed a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal site in Western Australia in 2020. The scandal triggered the departure of both Rio Tinto\u2019s chief executive and chair. Share\n\n4d ago 15.20 CEST US trade deficit widens slightly, labour market data softer US trade data and labour market figures are out. The trade deficit widened slightly to $75.1bn in May from $74.5bn, as exports fell by 0.7% month on month, countering a 0.3% decline in imports. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: Nevertheless, the decline in exports was more modest than the advance goods data had implied, so net external demand should now be a slightly smaller (albeit still sizeable) drag on second-quarter GDP growth. Factoring in the disappointing May construction spending data released yesterday too, we now estimate that GDP growth was 1.9% annualised \u2013 a little stronger than the first quarter, but well below the economy\u2019s immigration-boosted potential growth rate. The $3.1bn decline in goods exports was driven by a $2.1bn drop in industrial supplies, which was partly linked to the fall in energy prices. The $1.9bn decline in goods imports was more than explained by a $4.2bn fall in pharmaceutical drugs, which tend to be quite volatile on a month-to-month basis. For the second quarter as a whole, we estimate that exports declined by 0.8% annualised, with imports up by 8.3%. The latest labour market data still look a little softer ahead of key June payrolls figures, due on Friday. ADP employment increased by a muted 150,000, and initial jobless claims edged up to 238,000, from 236,000. Alongside the news that GDP growth remained lacklustre in the first half of this year, this new-found labour market softness is a little disconcerting. Share\n\n4d ago 14.41 CEST Oil prices hit two-month high ahead of summer driving season Oil prices have climbed to a two-month high, ahead of the summer driving season, and amid renewed tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose as high as $86.83 a barrel today, and is now trading at $86.41 a barrel, up 0.2% on the day. It has gained nearly $10 a barrel since the start of June. US light crude touched $83.36 a barrel and is now 0.2% higher at $82.97 a barrel, after pushing through $84 yesterday for the first time since April. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Oil prices are ticking upwards again, following a drop in US crude stockpiles for the week ending 28 June. Demand for fuel to power trips over the US holiday season is expected to be high. But traders are also eyeing potential supply constraints. Geo-political escalation in the Middle East is still a threat, given the ongoing violence in Gaza. The hurricane season forecast to be particularly fierce this year, given the devastation wreaked on the Caribbean this week and if severe storms hit the Gulf Coast, refining capacity could be significantly disrupted.

Syncona, a London-based life science investor that is listed on the FTSE 250, committed \u00a333.5m to the Series B financing, resulting in a \u00a314.1m uplift in its valuation of Beacon. (Series B financing is the second round of funding for a business through investment.) Syncona launched Beacon last year, after taking advantage of challenging biotech market conditions to acquire Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation off Nasdaq in 2022, and combining it with other pre-clinical programmes, including from the University of Oxford. Beacon, headquartered in London with another base in Massachusetts, focuses on developing gene therapies for both rare and prevalent diseases of the eye that lead to blindness, including X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Beacon\u2019s lead asset in XLRP is currently in intermediate to late-stage clinical trials. Share Updated at 14.11 CEST\n\n4d ago 12.47 CEST Eli Lilly's Kisunla is second Alzheimer's drug to get FDA approval The approval of Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla drug by the US health regulator means competition is heating up in the Alzheimer\u2019s drug market, analysts say. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday approved the experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug donanemab, marketed as Kisunla, for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody slowed the early stages of the fatal mind-robbing disease in studies. It is the second disease-modifying therapy to reach the AD market in the US, after Eisai/Biogen\u2019s Leqembi (Lecanemab) received full FDA approval last July. Philippa Salter, managing neurology analyst at the data and analytics firm GlobalData, forecast that Leqembi and Kisunla could generate global (US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan and China) sales of around $3.5bn and $2bn by 2030, respectively. She said: Despite gaining approval nearly a year ago, uptake of Leqembi has been slow. While the approval of Kisunla will provide further confidence [in this type of treatments], which could help drive the uptake of both drugs, many of the challenges faced by Leqembi will also apply to Kisunla. Both drugs require brain scans before treatment, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to assess levels of amyloid in the brain, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, with further MRI scans recommended prior to further drug infusions. She said access to these scans is a \u201ckey limiting factor for the uptake of these drugs\u201d. View image in fullscreen The Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla on Tuesday, for mild or early cases of dementia caused by Alzheimer\u2019s. Photograph: AP Salter explained: The MRIs help monitor for a known side effect of these drugs, the development of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs). The rates of ARIA were lower in Leqembi\u2019s Phase III trials compared to Kisunla\u2019s Phase III trials, giving Leqembi a key advantage in its safety profile. However, an important competitive advantage for Kisunla is its once-monthly dosing schedule compared with Leqembi\u2019s dosing of once every two weeks. Further, despite having a higher annual cost of therapy of $32,000 for Kisunla compared with $26,500 per year for Leqembi, Lilly states that in the long term, Kisunla will be cheaper and more convenient for patients since they won\u2019t have to take the drug indefinitely, something that was included in the FDA label, which states that once amyloid plaques have been reduced to minimal levels on PET imaging, stopping treatment can be considered. While there are clear advantages in not having to take a drug indefinitely, many questions have been raised about what happens once donanemab therapy is stopped. Further real-world evidence and clinical trial data will be key for physicians to feel confident in stopping treatment with Kisunla and therefore vital for the success of the drug.

Vodafone is seeking to acquire Three UK in a deal which is currently being probed by competition regulators, but many aspects of the new network sharing agreement are independent of the outcome of the Vodafone UK and Three UK merger. The agreement will see a combined Vodafone UK and Three UK commit to invest \u00a311bn in its network for the next decade \u2013 although this will be subject to regulatory approval of the deal \u2013 as well as Virgin Media\u2019s \u00a32bn annual investment in its network. The two operators have agreed subject to completion of the merger, Virgin Media O2 will acquire spectrum from the newly enlarged Vodafone and Three UK group establishing three scaled mobile network operators each with better alignment of spectrum holding. Ahmed Essam, chief executive of European markets at Vodafone, said: With this agreement and our merger with Three, we will transform the mobile experience for over 50m customers in the UK for the long-term, providing significant network improvements including more choice, better quality and greater coverage across the country. Lutz Sch\u00fcler, chief executive of Virgin Media O2, said: We are extending and bolstering elements of our existing network sharing arrangement,while also ensuring there is a robust, balanced and functional structure in place for the long-term should Vodafone and Three\u2019s proposed merger gain consent.

The shares fell as low as 38p and later traded at 39.4p, down 4.2%. Total sales were 6.9% lower year on year in its third quarter, while the UK tile market is down between 10% and 15%, and the company said it was taking market share. Demand for repair, maintenance and improvement has remained weak, especially for bigger projects. Like-for-like sales were 9.7% lower in the third quarter, similar to the 9.2% decline seen in the first half, although sales levels stabilised somewhat through the quarter. Topps said that slowing inflation, a pick-up in real wage growth, improving consumer confidence and increased activity in the housing market \u201cprovides some confidence in a cyclical recovery\u201d. But it cautioned that this recovery is yet to feed through into its market, and it is working to improve its digital offer to trade customers and other measures.

There is growing confidence that a majority for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally can be avoided in the second election round on Sunday, with political wrangling under way. France\u2019s CAC has gained around 1%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is 0.6% higher ahead of tomorrow\u2019s general election, Germany\u2019s Dax is also up by 0.6% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has risen by 1.3%. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at the trading platform Scope Markets, said: With President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist group and a left-wing alliance withdrawing candidates to minimise the number of three-way contests that might split the anti far-right vote, we have seen French [bond] yields head lower and stocks on the rise. With a hung parliament providing the basis for Macron to continue calling the shots, the market perception of a Le Pen victory comes down to the ability to achieve a majority or not. Tomorrow\u2019s UK election looks unlikely to create too many shockwaves given the sheer size of the majority expected for the Labour party. While Reform have been busy chipping away at the Conservative vote, recent scandals will have likely stifled support with two candidates defecting due to perceived racism within the party. For traders, the prospect of a stable Labour majority appears to be a positive, with sterling one of the best performing currencies over the past week. Looking ahead, the US jobs market remains in focus. Yesterday\u2019s JOLTS job openings data showed an unexpected rise counteracted by a downside revision to the May reading. Mahony said: With traders expecting a decline in Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls release, today\u2019s ADP figure looks to similarly head lower in a sign of weakness in the employment picture. The weakness seen for the dollar yesterday came off the back of comments from Powell, with the data dependent nature of the Fed being seen as a positive given the weakness expected in the jobs data this week. Nonetheless, traders will be concerned over the inflationary impact of the recent rise in crude oil, with yesterday\u2019s rise pushing WTI [West Texas Intermediate] through $84 for the first time since April. Share Updated at 14.38 CEST\n\n4d ago 10.44 CEST UK private sector growth at six-month low \u2013 PMI Expansion in the UK services sector slowed further in June with some evidence of a \u201cpre-election seize up\u201d feeding into a wider slowdown across the private sector to a six-month low, according to surveys. More momentum was lost in June, with the upturn at its weakest since last November as tomorrow\u2019s general election prompted some clients to adopt a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach before placing orders and commissioning new projects. New business intakes rose at a historically subdued pace, while the pace of job creation also eased. Meanwhile, firms\u2019 cost pressures continued to cool, but remained elevated. The rate of output price inflation accelerated slightly from May\u2019s recent low. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK services PMI business activity index remained in expansionary territory during June, posting 52.1. While this was the eighth consecutive monthly increase in output across the service sector, the headline index fell again, from 52.9 in May. Activity across the UK\u2019s private sector slowed to a six-month low. The composite output index, which pulls together the manufacturing and services surveys, remained in expansion territory at the end of the second quarter, but the pace of growth in business activity slowed for a second month running to its weakest in 2024 so far. At 52.3, down from 53.0 in May, the index was at a six-month low. Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: We are seeing some evidence of a pre-general election seize up across the UK services economy, with growth in business activity slowing to a seven-month low in June as the prospect of a change in government led to the adoption of a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach by some, restraining sales. Nevertheless, we\u2019re on track for another quarter of GDP growth, according to composite PMI data for the three months to June, albeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter\u2019s 0.7%. Turning to prices and firms\u2019 costs, he said: Prices still continue to show a high degree of stickiness across the UK service sector, although input cost inflation once again trended lower in June. The direction of travel here is encouraging for the Bank of England, but our survey\u2019s gauge of prices charged actually rose on the month as some companies noted their pricing power was strong enough to raise their fees. While costs, mostly from wages, have been the major driving force behind strong services inflation, the recovery of the UK economy from it\u2019s late-2023 lull adds another dynamic for policymakers to consider should stronger economic conditions motivate more companies to raise their prices.

It finished the day down 6.6%.\n\nThe filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which lists Gill as the reporting person, included a section \u201cCheck the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat\u201d under which the descriptor \u201cI am not a cat\u201d was checked.\n\nThe SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock\u2019s Friday closing price of $27.24.

The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.\n\nKrishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: \u201cThe vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France\u2019s high-stakes parliamentary elections.\n\nAgust\u00edn Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a \u201csmooth landing\u201d from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.\n\nGlobal government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.\n\nEmmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country\u2019s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nPolls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.\n\nCarstens said the BIS was not calling out any \u201cone or two\u201d governments but that the message was clear.\n\n\u201cThey [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a solid foundation to build upon.\u201d\n\nWith interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.\n\n\u201cThey can surprise you with not much notice,\u201d Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain\u2019s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss\u2019s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. \u201cYou really want to avoid that.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron\u2019s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 \u2013 an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.\n\nIf it forms a government, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn) for the rest of this year and \u20ac12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.\n\nThe left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.\n\nThe turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany\u2019s rising to its highest level since 2012.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The big three \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP Paribas and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u2013 are down 10%-14% since Macron\u2019s announcement.\n\nFrench banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.\n\nThe positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.\n\n\u201cCompared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,\u201d the former Mexican central bank governor said.\n\nAlthough Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.\n\nHe described an \u201cextreme\u201d scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.",

Pic: Reuters\n\nHaving turned the political map red, Labour's priority is steering the economy into the black.\n\nSir Keir Starmer's programme for government may be modest, but the means to deliver it are not.\n\nThe new prime minister and Rachel Reeves - the UK's first female chancellor - have a tough economic inheritance.\n\nFollow general election fallout live\n\nStagnant growth, hefty debt interest payments and an ageing, sickly population have left public services stretched.\n\nIf they are to revive them without breaking campaign pledges not to increase debt or raise taxes, everything rests on delivering growth.\n\nThe early indications from the financial markets was positive.\n\nBarely two years after Liz Truss's mini-budget sent the pound crashing and the cost of borrowing soaring, there was no similar drama to greet Sir Keir.\n\nBoth sterling and 10-year gilts were stable and the FTSE 100 index moved upwards, driven by housebuilders and lenders, an acknowledgment of Labour's plans to promote housebuilding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKallum Pickering, chief economist at investment bank Peel Hunt, said \"With this big majority early on, Sir Keir Starmer has momentum. So what does he do with it?\n\n\"There's too much debt to be lowering taxes or boosting spending. Those days are gone.\n\n\"So he'll probably use this for regulatory reform, the things that will be positive, like housing market reforms.\"\n\nHow to watch and follow the election All the information you need to see the results come in, wherever or however you like. Tap here\n\nThe FTSE 250, comprised of more British companies, also rose more than 1% in the first hour, a vote of confidence perhaps that Labour's promise of stability, the quality prized above all, will be delivered.\n\nSir Keir and Ms Reeves promise to stimulate growth but it will take the private sector, and the investors on whose confidence the UK relies, to deliver it.\n\nHow effective those plans are, and how new ministers handle a challenging in-tray and the inevitable unknowns, will shape the administration.\n\nTop of the list is planning reform, intended to accelerate housing and energy infrastructure, rewriting rules and reclassifying green belt to deliver homes in the face of inevitable local opposition.\n\nBarriers to onshore wind, moribund for a decade under the Conservatives, and solar energy, attractive to farmers but not their neighbours, will be removed, and the national grid will expanded and upgraded.\n\nThat should be good news for companies like Octopus, Britain's largest retail energy provider with ambitions to become a major generator if renewable projects become easier to deliver.\n\nFounder and chief executive Greg Jackson has welcomed Labour's commitment to the sector, which contrasted with Rishi Sunak's recent net-zero scepticism.\n\n\"I hope that what we've now got is the stability that we can invest in delivering a cheaper green electricity system,\" he told Sky News.\n\nRead more:\n\nLabour have won - but what happens next?\n\nLabour's journey back to power\n\nThe Tory story since 2010 in big pictures\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:32 Starmer: 'Change begins now'\n\nMr Jackson has specific demands.\n\nHe wants planning simplified - projects can currently take 13 years to get connected to the grid - market reform so local people benefit from local renewables, and a push to electrification.\n\nLabour will bring forward the phase out of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030, reversing Mr Sunak's delay to 2035.\n\n\"The big message for me is that voters have rejected going back to the world of fossil fuels and oil and gas. All of the research tells us that voters know that wind and solar are the cheaper, more secure, more reliable sources of electricity that we need,\" he said.\n\n\"Britain can really be a proud leader in this transition and that's going to be great for jobs.\n\n\"The countries that lead this way are the ones that are going to be most prosperous, and I really hope that that's where we're going to be now.\"\n\nWhile the oil and gas industry will baulk at an increase to the windfall tax and a ban on new North Sea licences, elsewhere Labour's approach has been largely welcomed by a business community bruised by Brexit.\n\nImproving the relationship with the EU is higher on business's radar than it seems to be on Labour's.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:32 Who is new PM Sir Keir Starmer?\n\nA return to the single market and free movement, a shortcut to growth, has been ruled politically and practically impossible in the short term, but Sir Keir and his team have talked about a warmer relationship with Brussels and improving the terms of the current deal.\n\nThree years after implementation, the negative impact on British companies trading with Europe is unarguable, with companies large and small no longer coy about mentioning it.\n\nSocrates Camenon founded his food processing and distribution company Golden Delight Foods in the 1980s, trading routinely with Greece and other European countries until Brexit.\n\n\"It has had a devastating impact,\" he said.\n\n\"We've lost all our exports, we're having continual problems of shortages of product, prices are increasing, and the difficulties in admin and paperwork is mind boggling.\n\n\"The red tape has created a nightmare.\n\n\"If a businessman makes a mistake he has to do a U-turn.\n\n\"We've made a mistake, we've got to go back there and re-negotiate.\n\n\"We knew the Europeans weren't going to make it easy for us, they had to make an example of us to set an example to 27 other states.\n\n\"But we've been the people who've been taken the pain.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:34 How election night unfolded\n\nCutting international red tape will be welcomed, but Labour's plans to impose domestic bureaucracy, in the form of employment reforms, has caused significant anxiety.\n\nThe \"new deal for working people\" has been downgraded from hard policy to a consultation, but it remains core to Labour's offer to voters.\n\nMeasures include the promise of \"day one employment rights\", including the right to parental leave and sick pay, ending \"exploitative\" zero hours contracts, and closing the ethnicity and disability pay gap.\n\nWith the living wage also rising, these are potential costs felt most keenly by small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe prospect of Ms Reeves equalising capital gains tax is also exercising some, a move that would end the unfairness of those who disguise income as capital gains paying less tax than workers, but could deter wealth creators whom it incentivises to take risks.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:47 Sunak resigns, saying 'I'm sorry'\n\nThe economic weather may bring some cheer, with inflation stabilising close to 2% and interest rates likely to fall next month, passing on a little respite to households and cheering markets.\n\nBut Ms Reeves and the new business secretary - Jonathan Reynolds has shadowed the role for more than two years - are unlikely to have the luxury of basking in it.\n\nThe in-tray is already full of thorny challenges, top of the pile Thames Water's debt crisis and the prospect of special administration, effectively nationalisation.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nThames' annual results will be published next Tuesday - and 48 hours later, regulator Ofwat will announce what it, and every other water company, can charge their customers in future, with steep increases guaranteed.\n\nIf Thames Water remains in its chief executive's words \"uninvestable\", the new government may have no choice but to trigger an administration that would be expensive and possibly open-ended.\n\nHow that is handled, and the outcome for Thames' shareholders and lenders, will have consequences for how the UK is viewed by the global investors Labour is relying on to fund the energy transition and beyond.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nOne nationalisation Labour are committed to is rail, albeit in stages as private contracts expire, and the business department will have to sign off the controversial foreign takeover of Royal Mail's parent company.\n\nAlso pressing will be a deal with Tata over the future of its Port Talbot works, a decision with far more baggage for Labour than the outgoing administration.",

        "body": "Forget the UK general election.\n\nThe poll that financial markets will be watching most closely over the next few days is the second round parliamentary 'run-off' in France this Sunday.\n\nThe French poll is unpredictable, to say the least.\n\nThe first round of voting last week raised the prospect of a hung parliament and prompted a relief rally in French assets on Monday this week.\n\nMarkets would prefer a hung parliament because Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National (RN or National Rally) and the New Popular Front (NPF) - an alliance of the far-left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialists - both want to raise taxes and public spending aggressively.\n\nBut uncertainty remains in the air as the NPF and French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble (Together) alliance scramble to prevent a triumph for RN.\n\nWhat next in French voting?\n\nUnder French electoral rules, where no candidate won outright in the first round of voting, a second round \"run-off\" is held between the two best-placed candidates and any other candidates who garnered more than 12.5% of the vote during the first round. Whoever gets the most votes in the second round wins.\n\nAccordingly, both the NPF and Ensemble have been standing down the majority of candidates in seats where they finished third last time - in the hope their supporters will vote tactically to keep out the RN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 14:41 French elections: Who are National Rally?\n\nLe Monde, the second best-selling newspaper in France, reported yesterday that 224 candidates have withdrawn.\n\nTactical questions\n\nThe tactic may not work, however, not least because the conservative Les Republicains - the party of former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy and which won 10.2% of the votes last Sunday - has given no such guidance to its supporters and could thus split the anti-RN vote.\n\nMoreover, a lot of liberal and conservative voters will be reluctant to vote for the NPF candidate when they come from France Unbowed, led by the 72-year-old left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who is often characterised as a French version of Jeremy Corbyn and who put together the alliance.\n\nEdouard Philippe, Mr Macron's former prime minister, has urged Ensemble's candidates to step down where they were in third place during the first round and get behind centre-right or centre-left candidates - but not candidates from RN or France Unbowed.\n\nA nervous watch\n\nLe Monde estimates that, of the remaining contests, some 409 will now be decided by a two-way duel. There are 89 three-way contests and two four-way battles.\n\nWith the RN expected by pollsters to get anything between 250 and 300 seats in the National Assembly - 289 is required for a majority and it came first in 296 seats in the first round - that has left markets watching nervously.\n\nEver since Mr Macron stunned Europe on 10 June by calling a parliamentary election, after Ensemble suffered a spanking in the European parliamentary election, investors have been rattled by the prospect of either RN or the NPF winning a parliamentary majority.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nMarket reactions so far\n\nThe CAC-40, the leading French stock index, fell by more than 6.5% between 10 June and last Friday - the final day before the first round of voting.\n\nSome individual stocks have fallen by more, though, with the banks Societe Generale and Credit Agricole down 10% and 7% respectively since Mr Macron called the election. The construction-to-telecoms conglomerate Bouygues has also fallen by 10% and Vinci, the construction and infrastructure services group which owns the UK civil engineer Taylor Woodrow, is down by more than 7.5%.\n\nThere has also been a sell-off in French government bonds - reflecting concerns that a high-spending RN or NPF government would increase borrowing.\n\nThe yield (bond yields rise as the price falls) on 10-year French government bonds jumped from 3.118% on the day before Mr Macron called the election to as much as 3.373% on Tuesday this week.\n\nAnd the premium that investors demand for holding 10-year French government bonds over their German equivalent surged from 47.61 basis points (0.4761%) before Mr Macron called the election to as much as 85.2 basis points (0.852%) last Friday - a sharp and pronounced move highlighting the anxiety of investors and taking the spread to its widest in 12 years.\n\nA French-style mini-budget moment?\n\nIt has led some investment analysts to speculate that France could suffer its own mini-budget moment - where bond investors sell the government's debt for fear of extra borrowing surging out of control.\n\nThe uncertainty has even spilled over to the Euro, which has fallen from $1.09 just before the European elections to as low as $1.067 in the days after Mr Macron called the snap poll, although it has since rallied to around $1.079.\n\nSome analysts now argue French assets represent good value, assuming the second round of voting produces a hung parliament or a modest majority for the RN, which is regarded as a more market-friendly outcome than a victory for the NPF.\n\nMarina Zavolock and Regiane Yamanari, strategists at Morgan Stanley, told clients today: \"We believe the two key remaining French election scenarios - no majority and RN absolute majority - would both ultimately be followed by a recovery in French and wider-European equities indices.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nAlready existing concerns\n\nBut there are still widespread concerns - and so serious are they that the European Central Bank has even faced questions this week at its annual Central Banking Forum in Sintra, Portugal, over whether it would be prepared to intervene in the markets, if necessary, to prop up French government bonds.\n\nFrance is already under a so-called \"excessive deficit procedure\" with the European Commission for running a budget deficit of 5% of GDP - well ahead of the 3% limit led out by the Maastricht Treaty. That was already putting it on a potential collision course with Brussels in the event of a victory for either the RN or the NPF.\n\nSome leeway 'because it's France'\n\nFrance has traditionally enjoyed a certain amount of leeway from Brussels over running excessive deficits because of its importance to the eurozone - where it is the second-largest economy behind Germany.\n\nThat attitude was famously summed up by Jean-Claude Juncker, a former commission president, when he was asked in 2016 why France was not forced to play by the same rules as, say, Greece or Portugal: \"Because it's France.\"\n\nBut Reuters reported today that some of the ECB's governors are expected to insist that the central bank should not intervene until Paris has thrashed out some kind of agreement with the Commission over its deficit.\n\nHowever, during a panel discussion, Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, indicated the ECB could intervene and especially if a sell-off in French government debts spread contagion to other Eurozone debt - just as her predecessor, Mario Draghi, did in 2012.\n\nMs Lagarde said: \"The European Central Bank has to do what it has to do. Our mandate is price stability. Price stability is obviously relying on financial stability, and we are attentive to that.\"\n\nSo markets have been put on notice.\n\nThe bigger picture, though, is that bond investors will continue to have concerns about the French deficit whatever the outcome on Sunday.",

        "title": "Kinross Gold: The Impressive Operational Performance Continues (TSX:K:CA)",
        "body": "Bjoern Wylezich/iStock via Getty Images\n\nOverview\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) is a large gold mining company that is guiding for a gold equivalent production of 2.1Moz in 2024, which is roughly in-line with what the company has produced over the last couple of years. I have covered Kinross a couple of times per year since 2022 and the prior articles on the company can be found here.\n\nFigure 1 - Source: Annual Reports\n\nThe company has much of its production coming from North and South America nowadays, but a substantial amount of earnings and cash flows still comes from the low-cost Tasiast mine in Mauritania. Overall, it is a relatively well-diversified gold mining company.\n\nFigure 2 - Source: Kinross Presentation\n\nThe stock price of Kinross is this year up 41%, outperforming the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) by a decent margin, and most peers. The strong gold price has naturally been a tailwind for the company, but the strong operational performance has also been a significant factor. The company delivered a good Q1 result.\n\nFigure 3 - Source: Koyfin\n\nOperations\n\nFigure 4 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports\n\nIn the above chart, we can see the gold equivalent production and costs on a consolidated level over the last couple of years for Kinross. The production volume has increased slightly compared to a couple of years ago and main contributing factor to the production increase, is the ramp up of La Coipa in Chile. The all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") has also been relatively flat lately, which is better than many peers.\n\nLa Coipa did in the most recent quarter have a gold equivalent production of 71Koz together with a very competitive production cost of $733/oz. That is up from effectively no production in Q1 2022. So, it is fair to say La Coipa has been a very welcomed addition to Kinross' portfolio of producing assets.\n\nFigure 5 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports\n\nFigure 6 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports\n\nWith that said, Paracatu in Brazil and Tasiast in Maurtania are the two largest and most important producing assets for Kinross. The Q1 2024 gold equivalent production for the two assets were 128Koz for Paracatu and 159Koz for Tasiast.\n\nThe production cost was $1,059/oz for Paracatu in Q1 and costs costs will be slightly elevated for Paracatu during 2024 due to planned mine sequencing, but the cost should come back down in 2025. The production cost was $660/oz at Tasiast, which has both the highest production volume and lowest production cost among the assets, so it accounts for a disproportionate percentage of the consolidated earnings and cash flows.\n\nThe three remaining producing assets in the U.S. are slightly smaller and the production costs are also higher. However, they have, like most assets of Kinross performed reasonably well lately. The production costs have decreased some at Round Mountain and Bald Mountain over the last couple of quarters.\n\nFigure 7 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports\n\nProduction was lower in the most recent quarter at Fort Know and the production cost has ticked up slightly over the last couple of quarters. However, the processing plant will see a substantial boost to the production volume when the ore from the Manh Choh project starts to get processed at Fort Know, which is on track for first production in early Q3 2024. This will be a welcomed near-term catalyst for Kinross.\n\nThere is also a resource update and a preliminary economic assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) due to be released on Great Bear during the second half of 2024. While we can likely expect Great Bear to continue to grow for some time due to the ongoing drilling, the PEA will provide some more accurate initial estimates on what Great Bear can be valued at.\n\nPeer Comparison\n\nIn the chart below, we can see the forward-looking Price to Earnings and EV to EBITDA ratios over the last few years. A couple of years ago, the valuation multiples were much cheaper for Kinross, both on an absolute level, but also compared to peers.\n\nFigure 8 - Source: Koyfin\n\nThe valuation multiples for Kinross are now more in the middle of the range. Some of the companies in the chart below have more jurisdictional risk, which probably justifies a lower valuation. Alamos Gold (AGI) and Agnico Eagle (AEM) have slightly higher valuation multiples, which is also makes sense given the lower operating costs and less jurisdictional risk. So, that Kinross today is somewhere in the middle of the ranges, seems fair.\n\nWith that said, Kinross still has slightly more financial leverage than most of its peers, even if the company has deleveraged some over the last couple of years. So, there is more balance sheet risk with Kinross than most of the peers, but the absolute level of financial leverage isn't at an alarming level.\n\nFigure 9 - Source: Koyfin\n\nConclusion\n\nKinross has some high-quality assets, which have performed very well lately, so the management team has done great job. The company also has an interesting near-term catalyst with the Manh Choh project and the potential of Great Bear makes Kinross a very interesting long-term investment as well.\n\nFigure 10 - Source: Kinross Presentation\n\nWith that said, the stock price performance of Kinross has been strong and the company feels relatively fairly valued at this point. So, I am neutral on the stock here. I last bought Kinross in mid-2022, when the stock was really out of favor. I am today more focused on emerging producers and developers, where some high-quality companies are still trading at more depressed levels.",

        "title": "Stitch Fix: Short-Term Pop Won't Fix Longer Term Issues (NASDAQ:SFIX)",
        "body": "Photosomnia/E+ via Getty Images\n\nWall Street loves a good rebound story, but the critical question is if turnarounds can be sustained. One of the stocks that surprised us over the past month is Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX), the e-commerce company that used to be known for sending its customers a box of five stylist-curated items called \"Fixes,\" from which customers selected their favorites and sent the rest back.\n\nWhen the novelty of this approach receded, and especially amid weaker consumer spending post-pandemic, Stitch Fix started to tank. But an early-June fiscal Q3 (April quarter) earnings print started to reverse the story, and Stitch Fix has now rallied from its YTD lows and is up nearly 10% year to date.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nBut again, we have to ask critically: is the company capable of retaining this rally? In my view, the answer is no.\n\nI last wrote a bearish note on Stitch Fix in April, when the stock was trading in the ~$2 range. And while I certainly didn't foresee the post-Q3 earnings pop, I am standing by my sell rating on this stock as a plethora of short and long-term risks have emerged.\n\nStitch Fix primarily popped on the company's outlook for Q4.\n\nStitch Fix Q4 outlook (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nFor Q4, as shown above, the company has guided to revenue declining \"only\" -14% to -12% y/y, which is a sequential improvement from a -16% decline in Q3 and a -18% decline in the preceding Q2. The midpoint of the company's guidance range of $317 million is $10 million, or ~3 points of growth, better than Wall Street's $306.6 million initial expectations.\n\nThat being said: we have to recall how Stitch Fix is getting there. Earlier this year, the company noted that it would be throwing all of its resources behind improving customer retention, through a combination of both heavier marketing spend plus increasing customers' touchpoints with its human stylists. All of these efforts are going to be costly, and as reflected in the guidance, the company is expecting only a 1.6-3.1% adjusted EBITDA margin: the midpoint of which is lower than 2.7% in the prior year Q4, and the peak 4.0% margin that Stitch Fix hit in 2021. The company is effectively eroding the gross margin benefits it's gaining from selling a higher mix of private label items by spending more on sales outreach.\n\nHere are several other core risks to be mindful of here:\n\nStitch Fix's unique elements have lost their novelty; is it just a fad now? The idea of getting a \"Fix\" of five items and keeping only what you like was the whole selling point behind Stitch Fix in the first place. But declining active customers seem to be suggesting that people don't want this complexity in the shopping process. In fact, Stitch Fix introduced its direct-buy \"Freestyle\" program to mirror classic e- tailers : And in doing so, it lost its niche in the first place. Without much of a powerful brand to draw from, it's unclear how Stitch Fix plans to remain relevant.\n\nThe idea of getting a \"Fix\" of five items and keeping only what you like was the whole selling point behind Stitch Fix in the first place.

Amid \"basic convenience\" buyers, it's unclear where Stitch Fix fits in. Losing customers despite higher marketing spend. Despite Stitch Fix's efforts to draw more customers in, it keeps bleeding active clients.\n\nSteer clear here: Stitch Fix is very likely to unwind its recent rally.\n\nQ3 download\n\nTo me, despite the above-expectations guidance in Q4, the company's actual results in Q3 did little to inspire continued confidence in this name. Take a look at the Q3 earnings summary below:\n\nStitch Fix Q3 results (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nRevenue declined -16% y/y to $322.7 million, which beat Wall Street's expectations of $306.2 million (-20% y/y) by a four-point margin. Revenue growth did accelerate two points from a -18% y/y decline in Q2, but we also have to note that the company's comps are getting easier as we are lapping very weak sales in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Stitch Fix's core problem of losing clients has continued to feature prominently. The Q3 ending client count was 2.63 million, down -20% y/y and representing a loss of 172k clients from Q2 alone.\n\nStitch Fix Q3 customer metrics (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nAnd we also point out that this is in spite of Stitch Fix spending 53% of its revenue on selling, general and administrative expenses (five points higher than 48% in the year-ago quarter) and 9% on advertising (two points higher than 7% in the year-ago quarter), which more than nullified three points of higher gross margins from a higher mix of private label sales.\n\nThere are small product tests that the company is running to try to improve results. One new initiative is \"quick fixes,\" which gives customers the optionality to add a second fix upon checkout. CEO Matt Baer noted that this effort has helped to boost average order values on the Q3 earnings call:\n\nIn Q3, we leveraged our analytics capabilities to improve the profitability of fixed transactions while strengthening client satisfaction. Following a robust analysis of client interactions, we found opportunities to reduce underperforming shipments. As an example, we currently offer quick fixes, which provide clients the option to schedule an additional fix immediately following checkout. Utilizing our proprietary demand algorithms, we improve the performance of Quick Fix\u2019s by only offering them to clients when we know the new fixes have a high likelihood of success. Within three weeks of this change, Quick Fix average order value improved by 25%.\"\n\nThat said, new initiatives plus the company's heightened expense on advertising has cut sharply into profitability. Adjusted EBITDA declined -50% y/y to $7 million as shown in the chart below, while adjusted EBITDA margins of 2.1% were 140bps weaker y/y:\n\nStitch Fix adjusted EBITDA (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nKey takeaways\n\nWith Stitch Fix's customer base continuing to recede despite heavier efforts in advertising, I continue to be wary of Stitch Fix despite the stock's recent rebound in confidence. Longer term, I find it very difficult to believe that the company can compete in a world of much larger and better-recognized fast fashion giants. Continue to steer clear here and invest elsewhere.",

        "title": "GE HealthCare (GEHC): Near-Term Risks, But Some Interesting Longer-Term Opportunities",
        "body": "Med-Ved/iStock via Getty Images\n\nAs much as investors may want to consider themselves as long-term owners, the reality is that short-term company performance still matters, and nobody likes to see their portfolio holdings decline. I mention this at the open of this discussion of GE HealthCare Technologies (NASDAQ:GEHC) because I do see a split between a riskier near-term outlook that is dependent upon a strong second-half performance and a longer-term outlook that may undervalue some significant growth drivers within the business.\n\nGE HealthCare looks undervalued enough that I worry that I\u2019m missing something or taking too bullish of a view toward the company\u2019s growth potential. I can argue for a fair value in the low-to-mid-$90\u2019s, and even over $100 by some metrics, but investors clearly don\u2019t feel the same at this point. I don\u2019t love the fact that GEHC is playing catch-up in areas like photon-counting CT, and margins need to get better, but I\u2019m also excited by the potential of the company\u2019s Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (or PDx) business, with leverage to opportunities in Alzheimer\u2019s, cardiology, and cancer.\n\nA Strong #2 In Imaging, But Margins Have To Improve\n\nSiemens Healthineers (OTCPK:SMMNY) is comfortable on top in the imaging space with close to 40% share, but GE HealthCare is a strong #2 with over 20% share across MR, CT, X-ray, molecular imaging, and women\u2019s health and over 30% share in some particular markets.\n\nI like GEHC\u2019s breadth of offerings, as there really aren\u2019t any major areas of imaging where the company doesn\u2019t compete, and I believe areas like molecular imaging and image-guided therapeutics are well-situated for ongoing growth. I also like the fact that while this is a capex-heavy business, about 40% of revenue is still recurring, with close to half of that coming from service contracts.\n\nSpeaking of capex, I think the Street too often frets about how reliant imaging businesses like Siemens Healthineers, GEHC, and Philips (PHG) may be on hospital capital budgets. It is true that imaging is now a cost center with the move from fee-for-procedure to bundled reimbursement, but it\u2019s also true that imaging is a critical offering. Performing procedures without adequate imaging increases failure rates, and insurers now typically won\u2019t reimburse for readmissions within 30 days. Moreover, having adequate imaging facilities is pretty much mandatory if a center wants to retain quality physicians.\n\nWhile I am not overly concerned about capex budgets (though I admit they can cause short-term volatility), I am a little concerned about GE\u2019s lagging position in photon-counting CT. This is a big step forward in CT imaging, allowing for much sharper images (2x better) with less radiation. Siemens Healthineers has been in the market with a photon-counting CT system for a while now, but GEHC is still a few years away.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think that GEHC is going to permanently lose business, but I do think the lack of a photon-counting offering will be a headwind. Longer term, I expect the company to catch up and perhaps even surpass Siemens Healthineers. GEHC has chosen to go with silicon detector technology (vs cadmium zinc telluride at Siemens Healthineers), and while silicon has upfront challenges because it collects fewer photons, GEHC is using an \u201cedge on\u201d approach for its sensors and silicon can offer advantages like increased resolution, reduced noise, and cost-effective manufacturing.\n\nLast and by no means least, I want to see GEHC improve its margins within imaging. The company trails Siemens Healthineers by a noticeable amount; even if I fold in GEHC\u2019s Ultrasound business (which Siemens Healthineers includes in Imaging), margins are in the low-teens (around 13%) versus over 20% at Siemens Healthineers. Neither company offers enough information for me to get to the heart of why this should be; GEHC may be spending more on R&D (to catch up) or it may have more fundamentally inefficient manufacturing and distribution. Whatever the cause, it\u2019s a must-improve item for management.\n\nGrowth Opportunities, Particularly In PDx, Could Be Worth More Than Seems To Be In The Stock Price\n\nGiven that I follow Siemens Healthineers and Philips at least somewhat regularly (need to get on that next Philips article\u2026), I was going to write about GE HealthCare sooner or later. What has surprised me, though, is the extent to which the Street doesn\u2019t seem to care about some of the growth opportunities within the business that could drive better margins and revenue in the not-so-distant future.\n\nIn Ultrasound, GEHC is starting to see increased use of ultrasound imaging in surgery for visualization and guidance, as well as point-of-care treatment. Both of these could drive high single-digit to low double-digit growth in markets already worth around $1B each. Better still, with Ultrasound already producing good margins for GEHC, the incremental margins on this growth should be attractive.\n\nGEHC also has a new collaboration (the announcement was in October of 2023) with Novo Nordisk (NVO) to develop non-invasive treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes that will center around peripheral-focused ultrasound technology (or PFUS). This is a much more speculative opportunity, but the upside (if it works) could be significant.\n\nWhat really interests me now, though, is the PDx business. This is the business that develops and manufactures contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals for imaging, and I see opportunities in Alzheimer\u2019s, cardiology, and cancer that are worth noting.\n\nFor Alzheimer\u2019s, GEHC has an opportunity to leverage prescription growth for Leqembi (sold by Biogen (BIIB) and Eisai (ESAIY)), as the label requires four MRI scans during diagnosis and monitoring, as well as PET scans in diagnosis and monitoring. Not only might this drive incremental MR and PET scanner sales, but it will also drive incremental sales of Vizamyl, the company\u2019s tracer for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe cardiology opportunity is even larger. Flurpridaz is a new PET radiotracer for myocardial perfusion imaging that has shown significant promise in two pivotal studies. Flurpridaz offers better resolution (it has a shorter positron range than Rb-82), and this allows for more accurate quantification of blood flow as well as the detection of perfusion defects that might otherwise go unnoticed. It also has a longer half-life (110 minutes), which means that it can be produced regionally and transported to hospitals that don\u2019t have cyclotrons, and it can also be used in stress tests.\n\nThere are an estimated 9 million or so perfusion tests done annually, but only about 1M are done with PET because of the current limitations of the radiotracers used. With the advantages of Flurpridaz, it could triple the market, generating $1.5B or more in incremental revenue opportunities for GEHC.\n\nLast and not least is oncology. PET scans are already routinely used in many cancer cases, but GEHC has a pipeline of new radiopharmaceuticals targeting things like estrogen and Her2 receptors (relevant to breast cancer) and CD8, which can help doctors determine much more quickly whether a patient is responding to targeted therapy. Along similar lines, the company has a licensing agreement with SOFIE Biosciences to develop tracers targeting fibroblast activation protein (or FAP), which is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts.\n\nWith a growing number of more finely targeted cancer therapies on the market and in the clinic, I see a large market opportunity in radio-tracers that can help identify those patients more likely to respond to a specific therapy and/or determine a treatment\u2019s efficacy earlier in the process, thus likely giving physicians and patients more options.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nAs I said, there are near-term challenges. Orders have been sluggish of late (up 1% in the last quarter), and the backlog declined about 2% sequentially in the last quarter. The China business has been hurt by tough comps and some fallout from the corruption investigations (which led to pauses in capital spending), and management\u2019s guidance for FY\u20192024 calls for a meaningful upswing in the second half of the year that may be challenging to achieve, particularly given tougher comps.\n\nWhile not wanting to underplay the near-term risk and the sensitivity of the stock price to disappointing quarters/guidance (the shares dropped 14% with Q1\u201924 earnings), I do still see a pretty healthy long-term outlook. I\u2019m looking for revenue growth on the higher end of 4% to 5% over the long term, and I do expect margins to improve meaningfully \u2013 from around 17% last year (EBITDA) to over 18% this year, over 19% in FY\u201926, and toward 20% in five years.\n\nGEHC still isn\u2019t optimized to run as a standalone company, so I think there\u2019s room to improve the manufacturing and distribution efficiency, as well as exit TSAs, while also benefitting longer term from the launch and growth of higher-margin products (including very high-margin radiopharmaceuticals). Long term, I think free cash flow margins can move into the low double-digits (still a few points below Siemens Healthineers), generating high single-digit FCF growth.\n\nM&A is also a potential driver. I don\u2019t expect large-scale deals from the company, but I do think it will look for tuck-in deals to fill gaps and/or add attractive offerings in areas like Patient Care and PDx. GEHC does have a marketing alliance with Accuray (ARAY) and if that company is successful with its relatively new China-focused radiation oncology products, it\u2019s possible GEHC could look to enter the rad-onc treatment market; I don\u2019t think this is likely, as competing with Siemens Healthineers\u2019 Varian is not a simple task, but it is possible.\n\nGE HealthCare shares look undervalued to me on both discounted cash flow and margin/growth-driven EV/revenue and P/E, with a fair value range between the mid-$80\u2019s and $108.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI do think that GEHC faces meaningful competition in its major markets from companies like Siemens Healthineers, Philips, Hologic (HOLX) and others, and I do think the company\u2019s margins are not where they need to be. At the same time, I see avenues to improve these margins and I also think there is underrated growth potential in the PDx business. I am concerned that FY\u201924 guidance is too high and that a revision could lead to another sharp selloff, but below $90 I think these shares have long-term appeal.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "title": "Dividends Aren't Magic",
        "body": "FOTOKITA\n\nCo-authored by Rida Morwa.\n\nWhen I was young, I became obsessed with magic. While many might enjoy watching the theatrics of a magic show, my mind was always on how everything was done. I would record David Copperfield and watch, rewind, watch, rewind until the video was worn out. I was always trying to figure out the \"secret\" of the magic trick. I'd go to the library and read books about magic tricks, and take what I learned there to deduce how various performers tricked the mind.\n\nIt turns out, that many magic tricks have their basis in math. Those who create magic tricks use their knowledge of math, science, and psychology to devise illusions that create an entertaining show.\n\nToday, I am going to perform a magic trick, which has its basis in math. While the trick probably isn't going to get me an invitation to replace Criss Angel, it does provide great insight into how we should think about our investment portfolios and how we withdraw cash from them.\n\nDividends \"Don't Matter\"?\n\nSome have developed the theory that \"dividends don't matter\", and that an investor could achieve the same effect by selling off shares as they need cash. Their reasoning is that cash paid in dividends are paid from the company, and therefore the value of the company is reduced by the exact amount of the dividend.\n\nIndeed, cash paid from the company is not available for other uses. The book value of a company is reduced by the exact amount of the dividend with each payment.\n\nSo what is the one detail that this theory is missing out on?\n\nThe reality is that the stock market does not value companies based on book value. That's a good thing for the \"Magnificent 7\" as they trade at enormous premiums to book value:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) trades at the smallest premium of \"just\" 785%. It would only have to fall 83% to trade at book value. NVIDIA (NVDA) trades at the largest premium to book value and would have to fall over 98% to reach book value.\n\nI'll go out on a limb and suggest that these kinds of collapses among these companies aren't likely to happen. While one might argue that certain types of companies are likely to trade closer to book value, even those that some suggest \"should\" trade at book value often don't.\n\nFor example, Annaly Capital (NLY) is a mortgage REIT that invests primarily in agency mortgage-backed securities. Agency MBS is a very liquid asset, that you can buy directly through your brokerage account. As a result, many suggest that book value should be the prime measure of valuation.\n\nHistorically, NLY has traded from 80% to 160% of book value.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSince stock prices aren't directly tied to book value, $1/share paid in dividends could be worth more or less than $1 in share price movement. Share prices move every day, the value of a dividend in your pocket doesn't.\n\nThis isn't always a meaningful distinction. If you are in a bullish stock market and prices are always going up, then selling shares can result is very similar cash flows as a stock with identical returns that pays a dividend. If shares are trading at large premiums, then $1/share on the balance sheet might generate far more than $1/share in share price.\n\nHowever, when a bear market happens, and everything in the market is trading at a significant discount, receiving a dividend or selling shares can be the difference between you destroying your portfolio and coasting through the bear market. This is due to \"Sequence of returns\" risk.\n\nThe Magic Of Sequence Of Returns\n\nI'm going to show you a magic trick. Here is a chart of Annaly Capital (NLY) compared to Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the S&P 500 from April 1999 through June 26, 2024:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nOn a $1,000,000 original investment, QQQ more than doubled in the following year before the dot-com bubble burst, causing it to underperform. From 2002 through 2024, QQQ caught back up and outperformed NLY.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nSo if you could go back in a time machine and had to choose one of these holdings to buy and hold no matter what, QQQ would be your choice, right? After all, it ends with an extra $1.3 million in value. Who doesn't want an extra $1.3 million?\n\nNow for the magic trick. The same time period, the same tickers, with one small change. You see, the investor with $1 million in 1999 likely felt very good about retiring. $1 million is still a good bit of money today, but in 1999? If you were a millionaire, people thought you were set for life. So if that investor retired, and started withdrawing $40,000/year indexed to inflation (AKA \"the 4% rule\"), here is what that looks like:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nNLY goes from slightly underperforming, to dramatically outperforming. The investor in QQQ, using the 4% withdrawal rule, has to be extremely concerned. They have $129,564 left from the original $1 million, and the 4% rule prescribes withdrawing over $75,000 in 2024. Something that clearly could not be done safely. Meanwhile, the NLY investor has $6.5 million in share value, income of over $765,000 in 2023 and is withdrawing less than 10% of the income to meet the target withdrawal.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nHow can such a relatively small withdrawal cause such an enormous difference? Let's go back to where the wheels came off and look at the annual returns in the early years:\n\nPay attention to the value of QQQ in 2000 through 2001 without withdrawals:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nNow compare the same numbers with cash being withdrawn:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nThe withdrawals caused the QQQ position to be worth 21.5% less by 2002, than it would have been if the funds stayed invested. In essence, the investor was forced to sell shares at poor prices. So by 2007, without withdrawals, QQQ was able to fully recover and survive the Great Financial Crisis. With withdrawals, it was only able to recover to $489k and in 2008 it was at $234k while withdrawals were approaching $51k. Forcing the selling of even more shares at low prices.\n\nTell me again how \"selling shares is no different than dividends\".\n\nSelling Low Destroys Capital\n\nIt's math. If you are selling shares at low prices, then when the price recovers you will hold fewer shares, and therefore it will take more upside to get you back to even. With an income approach, where the amount of dividends you receive is greater than your withdrawals, you are buying more shares when prices are low.\n\nThe fastest way to devastate your retirement portfolio is to be forced to sell when prices are low. The Income Method is a strategy designed to avoid ever being forced to sell shares to withdraw income. This way, you can decide to sell on your own time, at good prices.\n\nNote that dividend investments are not magic. They do not guarantee that you will get a particular dividend indefinitely. They can perform exceptionally well, or poorly. Dividends can be cut, raised, or even suspended. Also, if you withdraw more cash than is produced by your dividends, you may be forced to sell shares at poor prices, creating the same problem QQQ had above.\n\nA well-constructed income investment strategy incorporates these risks. This is why we recommend having a diversified portfolio of at least 42 income-producing investments, rather than all your investments in a single ticker. We recommend an allocation to fixed-income, which tends to be more stable. Finally, we suggest planning on reinvesting at least 25% of your dividend income, both to provide a source of income growth and also to provide a buffer in the event that we see a period of higher than average dividend cuts.\n\nWhat Dividends Are Not\n\nDividends are not \"magic money\" conjured out of thin air. They are payments paid by a company or fund to shareholders. Those payments come from cash that the company or fund acquires. Where does the company or fund get that cash? It can vary. It can vary for the same company across different payments.\n\nCash on hand: Sometimes a company might have excess cash sitting on their balance sheet. Operating cash flow: Many companies will pay dividends from the cash that is generated by their operations. Various non-GAAP metrics often aim to measure the amount of recurring cash flow being produced by the company's operations. These include FFO (Funds From Operations), AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations), FAD (Funds Available for Distribution), and CAD (Cash Available for Distribution). These metrics can often be a fantastic way to estimate the sustainability of a dividend. However, be aware that even if the metric carries the same name, the calculation may vary from company to company. It is essential that you look at the reconciliation to GAAP earnings so that you understand what adjustments have been made. If comparing two different companies, make your own adjustments so that the metrics are comparable. Investment Income: Some businesses primarily make money through investments. Mortgage REITs or BDCs are examples of companies that generate most of their earnings through investments. Capital gains: Capital gains can be sources of cash that is eventually distributed. In many cases, large capital gains are a source of one-time \"special\" dividends. However, for other investments, it might be a recurring part of their strategy. For example, CEFs (closed-end funds) are required to distribute most of their realized capital gains. So if you invest in a CEF, you can expect a significant portion of your dividends to stem from capital gains. Borrowing: A company might borrow money, usually on its revolver, to fund a dividend payment. Raising capital: Companies can raise cash from issuing common or preferred equity.\n\nWhen evaluating a dividend-paying investment, it is critical that we take the time to understand the business model of the company and where its dividends are going to be paid from.\n\nObviously, we want to avoid companies that are funding their dividends primarily through temporary or unsustainable sources like borrowing, unless we have a very clear picture for how they will achieve coverage in the future.\n\nThere is no shortcut. Using a metric to screen investments to narrow down the number of options you want to do a deep dive on can be helpful. However, you cannot rely on headline metrics to tell you how a dividend is being paid and whether or not it is safe. There are always numerous things going on within a company. They might be increasing their overall debt level to expand, but the dividend is comfortably covered by existing operations. Or a company might have significant capital gains that won't be recurring, making the dividend appear covered when it won't be in the long run.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividends aren't magic, but they are capable of performing a very incredible magic trick. They can prevent you from being forced to sell shares during a market downturn. Share prices are volatile, and they can often have very little to do with the underlying business. For those of us who are not forced to sell shares, the volatility of share prices is an advantage. We get to choose on any particular day whether we want to be a buyer or a seller.\n\nFor those who are forced to sell shares, the volatility of market prices is a great risk. Selling shares at poor prices is the greatest threat to a retirement portfolio. Unfortunately, it is something that many find themselves doing out of fear or necessity.\n\nAn income-based strategy can help deal with some of the complications created by volatile prices. We have a tangible measure of what we are getting paid. Just like with your job, you know exactly how much you got paid. Live on less.\n\nI'm not going to tell you I have the secret code to avoid losses. Life isn't a video game, there is no cheat code. Anyone who tells you they have a way to guarantee you make $X without a risk of loss, buyer beware.\n\nWhat I will tell you, is that if you take time to approach the market in a reasoned and logical manner, it can be a great generator of wealth for you. You will need to keep a level head, avoid panicking, and work to identify the best investment options for your goals.\n\nFocus on what the companies do, and how they generate cash to pay the dividend. Make your best estimate as to whether or not they will be able to continue to do that. Sometimes you might be wrong, and that is ok.\n\nFocus on building your income, and make sure you are withdrawing less. Maintain a cushion of excess dividends, and if that cushion shrinks, that is a warning sign for you to change things in your portfolio. The greatest benefit of an income strategy is that you are not faced with the decision that so many had to make in 2001/2002 on whether or not it was safe to withdraw funds. Since you aren't spending money until it is paid to you, you know the budget you have to work with, and you know if you need to do something to either increase your income or reduce your spending before it is too late.\n\nMore often than not, investors who take an income approach to the market will be surprised at just how much income their portfolio is capable of producing. They often get to enjoy the magical feeling that comes with having a lot of cash flow.",

Lilly's, in phase 3, is known as orforglipron.

Moldt said that consumer health product demand is rising due to an aging population and higher incomes.\n\n\"Companies specialising in consumer health areas will likely remain attractive acquisition targets in 2024 because recently spun-off pure-play over-the-counter drug and consumer health businesses are expected to use transactions to accelerate their own growth and transformation plans,\" he wrote.\n\nThat means the companies like Kenvue (KVUE) and Haleon (HLN) could be on the lookout for potential acquisitions.",

So sorry if it's popped up 100 times before.\n\nBasically I'm currently a cybersecurity student in college. I have 2 more years to go, and through scholarship and a 20ish hour job at the dorms I have tuition, housing, and food covered. Basically I'm not losing money, not making it. But at least I'm not in debt compared to my peers.\n\nI have about 1000 dollars in savings, and I'm looking to begin leaning how to slowly invest in slow and safe ways. Does anyone have any good references to look at for decent investing advice / places I could start throwing tiny bits of cash at to start learning without risk of doing anything stupid and somehow taking on debt (idk being on reddit I've been very much scared bc of all those \"I made a short (idk what that is) and now my house is gone posts)\".\n\nBasically I want to learn but atm the whole thing looks terrifying, hard to navigate and a bit scammy atm. Like at this point I'm fine with a 5 % yearly return. Or should I aim for more ?\n\nEdit - Thanks so much for all the advice guys ! I've definitely learned that unfortunately 1000$ really is not much in the grand scheme of things. I guess some context is that the main goal of this is to gain financial literacy / perhaps make something of my small hoard ( to which many have said the best option is for it to remain as savings). Unfortunately I grew up in an area with little financial literacy and many of my peers live paycheck to paycheck / are in debt, so I maybe perhaps felt a little too good about my meager holdings.\n\nSome extra context - I work as a \"RA\" for my college so as compensation for a relatively easy job (aside from dealing with the police at 4 am) is that I don't make traditional rent payments as my rent and food expenses are waived.\n\nI'm located in the US\n\nAnd I'm so grateful for all the amazing advice yall have given me \u2764\ufe0f",

        "body": "Hi all, I have been following the Sirius (SIRI) and Liberty Media (LSXMK, LSXMA) stocks for a bit. I had read about the plans to combine into a new public company (https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/522/liberty-media-and-siriusxm-announce-transaction-to-simplify).\n\nMy understanding here is that shareholders of Liberty media stocks would receive 8.4 shares of the new Sirius stock for every share currently held. SIRI is currently trading at around $3.60 a share, whereas the Liberty media stocks are at $22.95 a share. Would this mean that if you own 100 shares of Liberty media currently, you get 840 shares of Sirius? This would mean a currently $2295 investment in Liberty would convert to a $3024 investment in Sirius with the current stock prices - about a 32% premium.\n\nObviously prices of both stocks will fluctuate and these numbers will (and already have) change, but I wanted to make sure I was thinking of this right and not missing any important considerations. Previously Liberty was trading at about a 10% premium, but with SIRI stock price recently (and Liberty remaining about flat) this has increased quite a bit.\n\nAny insight on the approach here and/or what to expect as we go into the 3rd quarter and closer to the time this expected transaction will occur? Thanks in advance for any insights here.",

        "body": "The U.S. stock market just scored a gangbusters first half of the year. If history is a guide, Wall street could be in for another robust six months, according to Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, up nearly 15% in the first six months of 2024, set a new record close for the first time in more than two years in January and since then has achieved 31 fresh all-time highs, a pace that equates to a new record close on roughly one of every three trading days, said a team of Comerica analysts led by John Lynch, chief investment officer.\n\nThe large-cap benchmark index also booked one of its best starts to the year ever. Its nearly 15% return through the end of June ranks as the 13th best start for the S&P 500 since 1950.\n\nHistory suggests that fast opening halves of the year generally maintain their momentum through the second half, Lynch and his team said in a Monday note.\n\nSince 1990, there have been only 10 occasions where the S&P 500 has achieved a return greater than 10% in the first half of a year. In each instance, the large-cap benchmark index booked a positive return in the second half of the year, averaging a 10.8% return over the next six months and a 14.2% advance over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Comerica (see chart below).\n\nSOURCE: BLOOMBERG LP, COMERICA WEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, presidential election years, particularly those where the incumbent president is running for re-election, also provide tailwinds for the stock market, the analysts said. \u201cRe-election years usually benefit from fiscal stimulus, which provides a cushion for equity markets.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has gained in every presidential re-election year since 1944 (see chart below), but this year\u2019s performance would still \u201cstand out\u201d because stocks \u201care not usually strong\u201d in the early parts of election years, said Lynch and his team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typically the second half of the year that produces the strongest gains,\u201d they wrote.",

Supply chain problems, shifting consumer spending patterns and other quirks related to pandemic lockdowns and their aftermath collided with stimulus-fueled demand to send costs shooting higher.\n\nThe years of unusually rapid inflation that resulted have changed the nation\u2019s economic picture in important ways. Businesses are more accustomed to adjusting prices and consumers are more used to those changes than they were before the pandemic, when costs had been quiescent for decades. Beyond that, the Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates to 5.3 percent in a bid to slow demand and wrestle the situation under control.",

While they have felt the bite of rapid inflation over the last few years, they are likely to have more wiggle room in their budgets and more options to ease the pain by trading down from name brands to generic, or Whole Foods to Walmart.\n\nPoorer families have had less room to maneuver to avoid the brunt of high prices. Although the job market is strong, with low unemployment and wages that have risen especially rapidly at the bottom of the income scale in recent years, some signs of economic strain have been surfacing among lower-income Americans. Credit card delinquencies have risen, many lower earners report feeling less confident in their own household finances, and companies that serve lower-income groups report that they are under stress.\n\nThe gulf between higher- and lower-income consumers has been widening for years, but it is expected to show up especially clearly in travel this summer. Surveys show that richer households are more optimistic about their ability to take trips, and services that they are more likely to use \u2014 like full-service hotels \u2014 are flourishing.

        "body": "Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com. Include your name and location, or a request to remain anonymous. Letters may be edited.\n\nA Salutation Situation\n\nI work in a very fast-paced, fairly large (over 500, under 1,000 people) work environment. Most staff are in person five days a week, with the exception of some specialist staff who were hired in a remote capacity. We use an in-house office chat function similar to Slack for communication (in addition to phones, email). There is remote team member who comes down to the office perhaps one or two times a month for a couple of days. When this colleague reaches out to team members via the Slack platform, he will frequently just say \u201cHi <Name>\u201d with no follow-up. And then, the \u201cHi\u201d just sits there, and languishes. And it freaks people out! And confuses people. And is deemed as not a great mode of communication. And everyone talks about it! But no one provides him with any feedback! How can someone deliver the feedback that he would benefit being a little bit more forthcoming? Or are we all just obstinate and are not being understanding of a different communication style?\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nThis sounds annoying and weird and, yes, confusing and bizarre and off-putting. It makes me feel crazy, and I\u2019ve only just read your email! Also, I have questions! For one thing: Is he saying \u201cHi <Name>\u201d as a way to start a conversation about work with the colleague to whom his \u201chi\u201d is directed? Or is he, uh, just saying \u201chi\u201d? Anyway, if it makes you feel any better, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s him. It\u2019s definitely him. And though I can think of a few very passive-aggressive ways you could respond to creepy salutations, I\u2019m not going to share them here. However, it\u2019s interesting to note that neither you \u2014 nor I, at least at first \u2014 seem to have considered that one option may be to simply, and straightforwardly, tell this co-worker to cut it out. Except it\u2019s not that simple. Delivering feedback about a person\u2019s personal \u2014 or, in this case, professional \u2014 communication style requires a light touch. It\u2019s a tricky situation: You want what you say to be understood by your colleague without being overshadowed by his potential embarrassment or defensiveness. In other words, you want to be clear, but kind.\n\nSo, might I suggest the following: Inject a little honest levity into the exchange with a digital-speak acronym or some sort of emoji. Send the guy a direct message and say, \u201cHey [insert co-worker\u2019s name], when you write \u2018hi\u2019 without any follow-up, it freaks me out!\u201d and append the message with an \u201clol\u201d or a laughing emoji. If you don\u2019t have the sort of relationship with him that feels conducive to doing this, then my suggestion is to just sit tight and swallow your irritation. You can\u2019t always have the last word.",

        "body": "The first vaccine for malaria received major regulatory approval in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t become part of vaccination programs in Africa until 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if it had come faster?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the shots had arrived\n\n9 years ago?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n143,000.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s how many children\u2019s deaths could have been averted.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\n\n\nNurses in countries from Sierra Leone to Cameroon are packing a new vaccine into the coolers they tote to villages for immunization clinics: a shot to protect against malaria, one of the deadliest diseases for children.\n\n\n\nBabies and toddlers in eight countries in the region recently started to get the vaccine as part of their routine childhood shots. Seven other African countries are eagerly awaiting its arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a milestone in global health.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a cautionary tale about a system that is ill equipped to deliver critical tools to the people who need them most. It took decades and at least a billion dollars to reach this point. Even now, only a fraction of the children whose lives are at risk will get the vaccine this year, or next year, or the year after. It\u2019s been clear for some time what went wrong, but almost none of those issues have been fixed. That means that the next desperately needed vaccine stands every chance of running into those same problems. Take, for example, a new vaccine for tuberculosis that started clinical trials a few months ago. If it works as well as hoped, it could save at least a million lives a year. We\u2019ll know by 2028 if it stops tuberculosis infections. But if it follows the same trajectory, it will be at least 2038 before it\u2019s shipped to clinics.\n\n\u201cChildren are receiving the vaccine, and for that, I am the happiest man in the world. But on the other hand, I cannot avoid being dismayed at this inexcusably long delay.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Joe Cohen, co-inventor of the first malaria vaccine\n\nThe U.S. Army started work on a malaria vaccine back in the 1980s, hoping to protect soldiers deployed to the tropics. It teamed up with the drug company GlaxoSmithKline, and together they produced promising prototypes. But the military lost interest after a few years, and that left GSK with a problem. The people who desperately needed a malaria vaccine were in villages in sub-Saharan Africa. They would not be able to pay for a product that would cost millions of dollars to develop. GSK needed an altruistically minded partner. It found one in the nonprofit global health agency PATH, and by the late 1990s they had a vaccine to test. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation put up more than $200 million to test it. The clinical trials were complex, because this was a whole new type of vaccine \u2014 the first ever against a parasite \u2014 delivered to children in places with limited health systems. The process took more than a decade. Finally, in 2014, results showed this vaccine cut severe malaria cases by about a third. This was a successful result, but not as much protection as scientists had hoped to see. Still, GSK and PATH planned a production facility to make millions of doses. Gavi, the organization that procures vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, with funds from donors, would buy them.\n\nThen the Gates Foundation pulled its support.\n\nThere was a shake-up in the malaria division, and the leadership reoriented toward a new goal: eliminating the disease. The new malaria team said the vaccine didn\u2019t work well enough to justify pouring millions more dollars into it. It would be better, they said, to wait for a more effective shot in the future, and in the meantime to fund other strategies, such as genetically modifying mosquitoes.\n\n\u201cIf you go from very enthusiastic to very unenthusiastic and you\u2019re the Gates Foundation, people pay attention.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Robert Newman, former director, Global Malaria Program, W.H.O.\n\nThe decision was driven by researchers who were looking at data. They didn\u2019t factor in that the idea of a vaccine, even one with limited efficacy, would be so important to African parents \u2014 and African governments, which would come to see this as a classic example of a paternalistic donor ignoring their priorities. More than 300,000 children died of malaria that year. The foundation\u2019s announcement shoved the vaccine into limbo \u2014 in ways the foundation today says it did not anticipate.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, we could have communicated more often and more clearly about our decisions and listened more clearly to what the impact of those might have been on other institutions and their decisions.\u201d",

        "body": "The video posted last year on Chinese social media showed more than 100 Japanese children, supposedly at an elementary school in Shanghai, gathered in their schoolyard. Chinese subtitles quoted two students leading the group as screaming: \u201cShanghai is ours. Soon the whole China will be ours, too.\u201d\n\nThe messages were alarming and infuriating in China, which Japan invaded during World War II. Except that the scene actually took place at an elementary school in Japan. And the students were not stoking hatred of China; they were swearing an oath to play fair at what looked like a sporting event.\n\nThe video wasn\u2019t taken down until after it had been viewed more than 10 million times.\n\nXenophobic online content like the schoolyard video is the subject of debate in China right now. Last week, a Chinese man stabbed a Japanese mother and her son in eastern China. Two weeks earlier, four visiting instructors from a college in Iowa were stabbed in northeastern China. Some Chinese are questioning the role that online speech plays in inciting real-world violence.\n\nChina has the world\u2019s most sophisticated system to censor the internet when it wants to. The government sets strict rules about what can and cannot be said about politics, economics, society and the country\u2019s leadership. Internet companies deploy an army of censors. Private citizens censor themselves, knowing that what they post can get their social media accounts deleted or, worse, land them in jail.",

        "body": "The Biden administration awarded $504 million on Tuesday to a dozen projects across the country in a bid to transform communities that had been overlooked in the past into technological powerhouses.\n\nThe grants will fund \u201ctech hubs\u201d that aim to bolster the production of critical technologies in regions including western Montana, central Indiana, South Florida and upstate New York. The hubs are meant to accelerate the growth of advanced industries in the United States, such as biomanufacturing, clean energy, artificial intelligence and personalized medicine.\n\nThe program reflects a federal effort to expand America\u2019s science and technology funding beyond Silicon Valley and a few coastal regions, an initiative that Biden administration officials say will help revitalize areas that have traditionally received less government investment. Proponents say the projects will help create \u201cgood-paying\u201d jobs and tap into underutilized pools of workers and resources across the country.\n\nThe $10 billion program was authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act, which Congress passed in 2022 to ramp up the domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and increase funding for scientific research. The idea of spreading technology funding beyond Silicon Valley helped the legislation win broader support from lawmakers representing parts of the country that were eager to benefit.",

Voting happens in two rounds, and candidates who reached certain thresholds will move on to the next round on Sunday.\n\nA two-year streak of high inflation has left low- and middle-income French families grappling to pay for basics like energy, gas and food, while wages, in some cases, have failed to keep pace. Polls show that worries over \u201cpurchasing power\u201d were a top concern of voters, alongside immigration and security. Blue-collar workers turned out in droves to vote for the National Rally, which is promising to aid households and curb immigration.

        "title": "1 Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole -- and Here's Why",
        "body": "With the stock market at record highs, you'd think that the vast majority of companies would be thriving. However, this just isn't the case, as there is a wide range of outcomes from businesses in all different industries.\n\nConsequently, some companies flat-out continue to struggle mightily with no end in sight, even though the economy has remained resilient. Here's one business that fits this category that I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole. And I don't think you should, either.\n\nStruggling with growth and profitability\n\nShares of Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) currently trade 98% off their peak price, a milestone achieved in January 2021. While this was one of Wall Street's hottest stocks during the pandemic, it has since become one of the most disappointing. And this is due to ongoing challenges that don't appear to be getting resolved anytime soon.\n\nLet's start with demand. Peloton is having a hard time boosting its revenue. During the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), the business reported sales of $718 million, which was down 4% year over year. This marked the ninth straight three-month period that a drop was registered, clearly not an encouraging sign. And that figure was significantly lower than three years before in Q3 2021.\n\nIt's not a shock to anyone that after economies started to open back up and consumer behavior normalized, Peloton would experience a slump. In other words, demand was probably pulled forward. That's understandable, and it's something a lot of internet-enabled businesses saw at the time.\n\nBut what's truly alarming is that Peloton just hasn't recovered. Its connected-fitness subscriber base is plateauing, indicating how difficult it has been to sell more of the company's expensive exercise equipment. And this is despite launching a bike rental program in 2022, as well as entering into distribution agreements with e-commerce juggernaut Amazon and brick-and-mortar retailer Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\nAnd the business remains in terrible financial shape. While driving top-line growth is clearly a huge problem, Peloton's survivability is in question. It doesn't appear close to posting a profit anytime soon.\n\nThe net loss came in at $167 million in the latest fiscal quarter. The new management team has embarked on sizable cost cuts, which is the right move. However, it's anyone's guess when things will turn around.\n\nA high-risk situation\n\nA reasonable investor might still consider buying shares in this troubled enterprise. Peloton's market cap of $1.2 billion is less than half its trailing-12-month revenue of $2.7 billion. These shares have gotten so beaten down that it's impossible to find any ounce of optimism as we look toward the future. Deep-value investors, particularly those with a certain level of comfort with high-risk situations, might take a chance on Peloton.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm not one of those people. I don't have the skill set to accurately predict when, or if, Peloton will get on the right track. And I'll gladly pass on the stock.\n\nWhat I've learned by observing Peloton over the past few years is that it's best to focus on identifying businesses that consumers can't live without. What would happen if Peloton simply didn't exist anymore? Sure, some of the company's most loyal customers would be upset. But there are an unlimited number of ways to work out that the void would be easily filled.\n\nOn the other hand, think about Alphabet or Visa, for example. They are so vital to our day-to-day lives that we can't imagine our world without them. Peloton doesn't belong in this elite group. And that's another reason I won't touch the stock with a 10-foot pole.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Peloton Interactive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Peloton Interactive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Peloton Interactive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 91%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "body": "For the past 30 years, Wall Street and the investment community have been waiting for a game-changing innovation or technology to come along that can rival or surpass what the internet did for corporate America. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) just might fit the bill.\n\nWhen discussing AI, I'm loosely talking about using software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally be responsible for. What makes AI such a potential cornerstone innovation is the ability for software and systems to learn without human oversight. This ability to become more efficient at tasks over time, as well as learn new tasks, gives this technology utility in pretty much all facets of the U.S. and global economy.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJust how big the AI revolution could be is left up to interpretation and the imagination. But according to the lofty estimates provided by analysts at PwC, artificial intelligence has the capacity to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. PwC came to this conclusion by deducing that $6.6 trillion would be added by increases in productivity, with the remaining $9.1 trillion aided by consumption-side benefits.\n\nDollar figures this large aren't lost on Wall Street's brightest minds. Most Wall Street institutions and analysts have set lofty growth expectations and sky-high price targets on market-leading AI stocks.\n\nBut there are exceptions.\n\nBased on the low-water price targets from select Wall Street analysts, the following three leading artificial intelligence stocks can plunge by up to 91%.\n\nPalantir Technologies: Implied downside of 65%\n\nThe first top-tier AI stock that might get taken to the woodshed, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR).\n\nWhereas one analyst believes Palantir still offers 35% upside from where it closed on July 3, Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital believes it's worth $9 per share. If this forecast proves accurate, one of the hottest AI stocks would plummet by 65%!\n\nAlthough longtime Palantir bear Jaluria recognizes that its operating results have been solid, a May 2024 note implies concern about the company's commercial segment. Specifically, Jaluria points to revenue that's been pulled forward from special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that had signed deals with Palantir. There's no telling how sustainable or recurring this revenue will be.\n\nWhile Jaluria's concern is valid -- most SPACs have been disasters for investors -- Palantir does bring identifiable competitive advantages to the table that clearly do deserve some premium. For instance, the scope of services provided by Palantir can't be duplicated at scale by any other business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir's bread-and-butter operating segment has long been Gotham. This is the AI-driven platform that helps governments gather data and plan missions, among other tasks. The company typically secures multiyear contracts from governments using Gotham, which leads to sustained double-digit sales growth and predictable cash flow.\n\nHowever, the company's future likely rests with the success of its Foundry platform, the aforementioned \"commercial\" segment. Foundry is tasked with helping businesses understand their data so they can streamline their operations. Commercial customer count has surged 53% over the last year (as of March 31, 2024), albeit this segment is still in its very early stages of growth.\n\nAlthough Palantir can deliver sustained double-digit sales growth and is irreplaceable at scale, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 65 and a price-to-sales ratio of 25 (based on trailing-12-month sales), are tough pills to swallow in an already pricey stock market.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 22%\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that might face a coming beatdown is the company that's benefited most from the AI revolution: semiconductor titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWhile most Wall Street analysts can't set their price targets high enough for this leading AI stock, Deutsche Bank's Ross Seymour set a $100 price target ($1,000 prior to Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split) in May. If Nvidia were to hit $100 per share, it would shed 22% of its current value, which translates to almost $700 billion in lost market cap.\n\nIn many ways, Nvidia's expansion has been flawless. The company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) has quickly become the must-have chip for AI-accelerated data centers. Last year, Nvidia's GPUs accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped, according to TechInsights. With its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture set to make its debut in the latter half of this year, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble maintaining its compute advantage in enterprise data centers.\n\nHowever, history has consistently been a thorn in the side of businesses leading next-big-thing revolutions. Since the advent of the internet, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that's avoided a bubble in its early innings. Investors habitually overestimate the uptake and growth potential of new innovations and technologies while giving them no time to mature. Artificial intelligence seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nNvidia's fiscal second-quarter adjusted gross margin forecast of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) may also be an ominous warning. While an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% is still well above its historic norm, it represents a decline of 235 to 335 basis points from the sequential quarter. Putting two and two together, it suggests that competitive pressures have entered the picture.\n\nExternal competitors are releasing or ramping up production of their respective AI-GPUs in the second half of the year, while Nvidia's top four customers by net sales are all developing AI-accelerating chips of their own for their data centers. The GPU scarcity responsible for fueling Nvidia's scorching-hot adjusted gross margin looks set to wane -- and that's potentially bad news for investors.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 91%\n\nHowever, the potential disaster du jour among AI stocks is the world's most-valuable electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). The company's full self-driving (FSD) software, which uses a network of cameras and ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles, is a perfect example of how Tesla incorporates AI into its EVs.\n\nIn mid-April, longtime Tesla bear Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research lowered his uber-specific price target on Tesla to $22.86 per share. Historically, Johnson has arrived at his price targets by placing a multiple of 15 on his forward-year earnings estimate for the company and applying a 9% discount rate at the current price.\n\nThere's no denying that Tesla has done what had been impossible in the auto industry for more than a half-century. CEO Elon Musk successfully built the company from the ground up to mass production, and has delivered four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. But the praise ends here.\n\nOver the last 18 months, Tesla has slashed the selling price for its fleet of EVs on more than a half-dozen occasions. With its first-mover advantages waning and competition picking up, Musk has had no choice but to become more price-competitive. The end result has been a steep reduction in the company's operating margin, a reversal to a free cash outflow during the first quarter, and a big increase in the company's EV inventory.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla's efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. Though it does have a handful of small victories under its belt, the growth rate for Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment has tapered significantly, while gross margin for Services is in the low single digits. As much as investors want to pretend that Tesla is an energy or tech company, the bulk of its sales and profits still come from its now-struggling and cyclical EV operations.\n\nThe other damning factor for Tesla is the laundry list of promises and innovations from Musk that have failed to take shape. After a full decade of promising Level 5 autonomy for his company's EVs, Tesla's FSD hasn't budged from Level 2 autonomy. What's more, the Cybertruck has been an early stage flop, with multiple recalls and subpar deliveries.\n\nTesla is an auto stock with contracting margins and declining EV deliveries that's trading at a premium to even the loftiest of AI stocks. While a 91% drop might be a bit extreme, I'd have to concur with Gordon Johnson that significant downside seems likely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 68% of His Foundation's $46 Billion Portfolio Invested in 3 Phenomenal Stocks",
        "body": "Bill Gates is one of the best-known billionaires in the world.\n\nThe Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) founder became the first centibillionaire in 1999, decades before anyone else reached that level of wealth. He's still worth well over $100 billion today despite giving away billions to charitable causes and nonprofits over the past 25 years. Most of his donations go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to enhance healthcare and reduce poverty around the world.\n\nGates isn't the only centibiliionaire funding the nonprofit. Warren Buffett has also pledged donations to the foundation since 2006, but those contributions will end after his death. Buffett also served as a trustee until 2021.\n\nThe foundation's trust includes an equity portfolio valued at around $46 billion today, but over two-thirds of that amount, about 68%, is invested in just three stocks.\n\n1. Microsoft (37%)\n\nIt's probably not a huge surprise that Microsoft makes up a significant chunk of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. Bill Gates founded the company in 1975 and remains one of the largest individual shareholders despite donating and selling millions of shares worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nGates made a $20 billion donation in 2022, and a large portion of that donation appears to have been in the form of Microsoft stock. The trust's share count increased by over 38 million that year. It now has about 36.5 million shares worth nearly $16.8 billion, as of this writing.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has been able to hold on to most of those shares, and it's paid off handsomely. Microsoft shares are up more than 63% since the end of July 2022, driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in AI, thanks in part to its investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It added $10 billion to its investment in early 2023, which positioned it as a top choice for developers looking to use the public cloud to train and deploy AI-powered applications. AI-related services helped drive its Azure cloud platform revenue growth of 31% in its most recent quarter. That's faster growth than anyone else in the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft remains a dominant force in enterprise software with its Windows OS and Office productivity suite. It's adding enhanced AI features and seeing strong traction in sales.\n\nMicrosoft's shares trade for a high valuation of about 34 times forward earnings. But with a long runway for growth in cloud computing and AI, the cash cow of its enterprise software business, and its current cash position, it may be worth the high multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Waste Management (16%)\n\nWaste Management (NYSE: WM) isn't the kind of company you think of when you think of when you think of a tech billionaire. But Gates is probably more influenced by Buffett than by Silicon Valley's tech elite. Waste Management is a textbook Buffett stock.\n\nThe business is easily understood, it's absolutely boring, and it provides stable and growing revenue. The company benefits from a wide economic moat derived from its landfill ownership and route density. That allows Waste Management to increase its pricing faster than inflation. The company also grows from acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Stericycle.\n\nThe company's also found ways to reduce costs over the past decade. Its operating margin climbed from around 15% 10 years ago to 19.4% over the trailing 12 months.\n\nGates has held shares of Waste Management for the foundation trust for over a decade, doubling down on the position in 2022. The position has paid off well, as the stock's total return over the past decade has more than doubled the S&P 500.\n\nThe stock currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of about 17.25, which is comparable with its closest competitors. While it might be a bit expensive for a boring businesses, Waste Management's strong position in its stalwart industry might make the stock worth the price for someone looking for a stable utility.\n\n3. Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (15%)\n\nAs mentioned, Buffett has been a longtime contributor to the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. The way Buffett donates his wealth is by converting his Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares (NYSE: BRK.A) into Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (NYSE: BRK.B). He then donates the Class B shares.\n\nThe maneuver allows Buffett to retain control of Berkshire Hathaway while giving away much of his wealth. He donates about 5% of his remaining shares to various nonprofits every year.\n\nThe trust's current position in Berkshire Hathaway is actually one of the lowest levels of concentration in the stock. Buffett's donation stipulates the foundation spend the entire value of his contribution each year plus 5% of its net assets. In effect, Buffett's making sure the foundation doesn't stockpile Berkshire stock. That's resulted in a steadily declining share count over the past few years, as Berkshire stock has increased in value.\n\nThere's good reason to expect Berkshire to outperform the S&P 500. First, its forward P/E of just 18.5 presents good value to the market. That's despite Buffett's assertion that the company's current mix of wholly and partially owned businesses present better earnings prospects than the average American corporation. That valuation is made even more attractive when you account for the $189 billion in cash and treasury bonds on Berkshire's balance sheet, the strong free cash flow of Berkshire's core operations, and Buffett's consistent share repurchases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

My grandfather passed away several weeks ago. The loan is now in default and I have no idea where my cousin is. I\u2019m appalled. What happens now?\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nIf a co-signer on a loan dies, is the loan forgiven, or is the estate forced to pay?\n\nThe Cousin\n\nRelated: \u2018He thinks I\u2019m too materialistic\u2019: My husband and I are in our 40s. He takes zero interest in our finances. He doesn\u2019t even know the name of our mortgage company. What can I do?\n\nResearch shows that a quarter of co-signers end up making at least one payment. - MarketWatch illustration\n\nDear Cousin,\n\nI\u2019m sorry your grandfather passed away, and I only hope that he had no knowledge of his grandson\u2019s behavior before he died. I have good news for your grandfather\u2019s estate \u2014 and his heirs \u2014 and bad news for the grandson who skipped town.\n\nUpon the death of a MEFA loan nonstudent co-borrower, the deceased and their estate are no longer liable for the loan, according to a spokesperson for MEFA. The estate should notify MEFA\u2019s loan-servicing company, AES, at 800-233-0557 in order to provide proper documentation.\n\n\u201cUpon the passing of a co-borrower, a student borrower does remain responsible for the loan,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cPer MEFA\u2019s policy, a loan that is 180 days past due is deemed to be defaulted and may be referred to our default collections firm.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the loan won\u2019t go away just because your cousin skipped town. \u201cWe urge any MEFA loan borrower who is behind on loan payments to reach out to us so that we can help them manage their loan obligations,\u201d the MEFA spokesperson says.\n\nThere\u2019s one important takeaway for a co-signer of a student loan: Make sure the loan is not for more than you can afford to repay. Research shows that a quarter of co-signers end up making at least one payment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the borrower misses payments \u2014 even if they later catch up \u2014 the missed payments could hurt the co-signer\u2019s credit score, which could then push up the cost of car and personal loans and mortgages for that borrower, or even result in a loan application being declined.\n\nEven co-signing for a loan can impact a person\u2019s credit score. A FICO FICO credit score is calculated using a variety of credit data, including payment history (35%), the amount the person owes (30%), the length of their credit history (15%), new credit (10%) and their credit mix (10%).\n\nRequesting a lower monthly payment\n\nYour cousin could request a lower monthly payment on his student loan. Most reputable loan companies will want to work with borrowers to get them back into the black. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says rehabilitation programs are offered by some lenders.\n\n\u201cBe sure your lender tells the primary borrower all the requirements of the program, such as additional costs, and whether the default note can be removed or updated on your credit reports,\u201d the CFPB says.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easy to see your cousin as a ne\u2019er-do-well who took advantage of your grandfather, but the truth is probably more complicated than that. He likely got in over his head, got scared and ran instead of facing up to his responsibilities.\n\nOver the past 30 years, adjusted for inflation, annual tuition costs grew from $4,160 to $10,740 at public four-year colleges in the U.S., and from $19,360 to $38,070 at private nonprofit institutions, Forbes reported in April.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel sympathy for your cousin and the many others like him. Student-loan debt is a huge burden for millions of Americans. The total amount of student debt currently stands at $1.75 trillion, with federal student loans accounting for more than 90% of that figure, Forbes added.\n\nIf your cousin is looking for a job, he should know that approximately 95% of companies carry out background checks on job candidates and, according to this survey by HR.com and the National Association of Professional Background Screeners, 16% pull credit or financial checks.\n\nSo what now? If your cousin gets in touch with you, tell him that you are here to help \u2014 not as a co-signer, but as support to help him go through his finances and work out a payment plan. The real monster in this situation is the unpaid debt, not your cousin.\n\nOther columns from Quentin Fottrell:\n\n\u2018Our children have varying degrees of success\u2019: My husband and I are in our 80s and have $300,000 to leave our 3 kids. Do we give more to our underemployed son?\n\n\u2018My stepmother makes me feel unwelcome\u2019: I bought a house for my father in 2008, but now he wants me to sign over a 50% share for his third wife\n\n\u2018She told my grandchildren lies about me so they would despise me\u2019: I\u2019m disinheriting my ungrateful and selfish daughter.

        "body": "An art school teacher puts final touches on a painting of Indian businessman Gautam Adani highlighting the ongoing crisis of the Adani group in Mumbai on February 3, 2023. Indranil Mukherjee/Getty Images\n\nActivist short-seller Hindenburg Research wiped out $153 billion in market value from Adani Group.\n\nIt recently disclosed that it made just $4 million for its efforts.\n\nDetailed below is the war of words that's taken place over the past 18 months.\n\nNate Anderson, the chief mind behind activist short-seller Hindenburg Research, has had an eventful past 18 months.\n\nIn January 2023, he accused the Indian conglomerate owned by Gautam Adani \u2014 one of the world's richest people \u2014 of fraud, subsequently wiping out $153 billion in market value from its associated companies. This led Indian regulators to his doorstep and forced him into defensive mode. A war of words has persisted ever since.\n\nA year and a half later, the battle continues. And based on new information released by Hindenburg, one might wonder whether it was all worth it.\n\nThe firm \u2014 which describes itself as specializing in \"forensic financial research\" \u2014 recently disclosed that it's made just $4 million from its considerable efforts. Compared to the nine figures of market value it helped erase, and the $80 billion wiped from Adani's personal fortune, that's a drop in the bucket.\n\nDetailed below is the considerable back-and-forth that's taken place since Hindenburg's initial shot across the bow of Adani Group. The tale that follows highlights the lengths a global conglomerate \u2014 and the regulatory body with a vested interest in keeping it afloat \u2014 will go to defend itself. It also shows the resolute nature of Anderson as he continues fighting back.\n\nThe initial report\n\nHindenburg accused Indian business magnate Gautam Adani in 2023 of pulling off the \"largest con in corporate history.\" It was the result of a two-year-long investigation, which found a number of financial and accounting irregularities in Adani's empire, the firm said in its 106-page report.\n\n\"Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades,\" the report said. \"We believe the Adani Group has been able to operate a large, flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors, journalists, citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal,\" it later added.\n\nHindenburg identified at least 38 shell companies closely related to Adani Group, which it said appeared to engage in stock manipulation and money laundering. It cited \"numerous examples\"of those companies funneling money through private companies owned by Adani, before cash was set to Adani's listed public companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe short-seller's investigation also found Adani's private and public companies to have \"numerous\" undisclosed transactions with other parties, the researchers found, which violates regulatory laws in India.\n\nThe \"labyrinthian network of shells appears to serve several functions, including shuffling losses into private entities to boost reported earnings, and surreptitiously moving money to prop up entities in the group,\" Hindenburg said.\n\nAdani Group was also affiliated with a number of funds that displayed \"flagrant irregularities,\" the research firm said, such as being offshore entities, having concealed ownership information, and having portfolios being \"almost exclusively\" invested in Adani's firms.\n\nOne such fund, Elara, controlled another fund that was around 99% concentrated in Adani shares. That suggested to the researchers it was \"obvious Adani controls the shares,\" the report said.\n\nHindenburg attached a list of 88 questions for Adani to answer, which included inquiries into the billionaire's close contacts, Adani Group executives, and investigations into the company by regulators.\n\n\"If Gautam Adani embraces transparency, as he claims, they should be easy questions to answer,\" the report said.\n\nThe response\n\nNursing deep stock losses, Adani Group hit back with its own 413-page response, calling Hindenburg's original report \"nothing but a lie.\"\n\n\"We are shocked and deeply disturbed to read the report published by the 'Madoffs of Manhattan,'\" the reply said, referring to Hindenburg.\n\n\"The document is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and concealed facts relating to baseless and discredited allegations to drive an ulterior motive,\" it added.\n\nThe firm disclosed information on its accounting practices and professional relationships, while disputing many of the claims in the Hindenburg report.\n\nTransactions that were identified as suspicious by Hindenburg's team were in compliance with local laws and accounting standards, it said. Offshore companies and funds mentioned in Hindenburg's report were merely public shareholders in Adani-listed companies, the retort added.\n\n\"A listed entity does not have control over who buys/sells/owns the publicly traded shares or how much volume is traded, or the source of funds for such public shareholders nor it is required to have such information for its public shareholders under the laws of India. Hence we cannot comment on trading pattern or behavior of public shareholders,\" Adani's report said.\n\nThe firm also criticized Hindenburg for its financial stake in releasing the report, calling the firm an \"unethical short seller\" and guilty of a \"flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws.\"\n\n\"This is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable Hindenburg, an admitted short seller, to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors,\" it said.\n\nHindenburg issued a reply to Adani on the same day, denying any wrongdoing from its original report. They argued that Adani Group's reply failed to answer most of their questions. The conglomerate also didn't dispute the existence of certain \"suspect\" transactions, nor did it explain \"their obvious irregularities,\" researchers added.\n\n\"We also believe that fraud is fraud, even when it's perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world,\" Hindenburg Research said in its reply.\n\nAdani Group eventually lawyered up and readied for a fight, though the damage had already been done. In less than a week, Adani, known as the world's third richest man, saw his personal wealth plummet by $52 billion.\n\nConflict over Hindenburg's short-selling arrangement\n\nIndian regulators have raised specific questions about the structure of Hindenburg's short bet on Adani Group. The Securities and Exchange Board of India \u2014 the country's version of the SEC \u2014 sent a notice to Hindenberg in June 2024, raising questions about the nature of the report and the firm's relationship with Kingdon Capital Management, a New York hedge-fund involved in building a short position against Adani Group.\n\nHindenburg's initial report was described to be \"misleading\" and have contained \"inaccurate statements.\"\n\n\"These misrepresentations built a convenient narrative through selective disclosures, reckless statements, and catchy headlines, in order to mislead readers of the report and cause panic in Adani Group stocks, thereby deflating prices to the maximum extent possible and profit from the same,\" the notice read.\n\nRegulators also revealed that Hindenburg had shared its research with Kingdon prior to publication. The two companies had a profit-sharing agreement, the notice says, with Hindenburg set to get 25% of Kingdon's profits for the short bet.\n\nKingdon ended up making $22.3 million on the bet, $5.5 million of which is owed Hindenburg. $4.1 million of that had been paid as of the start of June, the document shows.\n\nHindenburg shrugged off the letter as \"nonsense,\" and an attempt to ward off whistleblowers who expose corruption among the country's most powerful people and companies.\n\n\"One might think that a securities regulator would be interested in meaningfully pursuing the parties that ran a secret offshore shell empire engaging in billions of dollars of undisclosed related party transactions through public companies while propping up its stocks through undisclosed share ownership via a network of sham investment entities,\" Hindenburg said in its reply.\n\nIt added: \"Instead, SEBI seems more interested in pursuing those who expose such practices.\"\n\nA passion for 'finding scams'\n\nBacklash is nothing new to Anderson, who's targeted other high-profile financiers and began sniffing out wrongdoers on Wall Street long before he launched Hindenburg Research in 2017.\n\nThis decade alone he's been instrumental in weeding out companies in the electric-vehicle industry. His work on Nikola led to fraud charges against its founder, and he also called out now-defunct Lordstown Motors for hyping up commercial interest in its product.\n\nMore recently he took aim at activist investor Carl Icahn and his famed operation, Icahn Enterprises.\n\n\"Find[ing] scams\" has been a life-long passion, he told the New York Times in a 2021 interview, adding that he had spent hours off-the-clock looking into potential schemes, to the chagrin of some of his former bosses.\n\n\"I didn't plan it this way,\" he told the Times. \"It was a side hobby that my employers were sometimes annoyed by.\"\n\nFraud-finding is one of his top goals of 2024, he wrote in a post on X in January.\n\n\"My 2023 New Years professional resolution is to work with our @HindenburgRes team to expose some of the biggest frauds and financial charlatans in the world,\" Anderson wrote. \"I am very confident we will achieve this goal.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "body": "In today's economy, understanding where your income places you on the socioeconomic ladder is crucial. The lines between income classes can seem blurred, but recent data clarifies income distribution in the United States.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare ?\n\nAre you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, the median income of middle-class households increased from about $66,400 in 1970 to $106,100 in 2022, reflecting a 60% increase. In the same period, upper-income households saw a 78% rise in median income, from about $144,100 to $256,900. These figures, scaled to a three-person household and adjusted for 2023 dollars, illustrate a growing disparity between income classes.\n\nLower-income households have experienced slower growth, with median income increasing by only 55%, from about $22,800 in 1970 to $35,300 in 2022. This slower growth has widened the income gap significantly. In 2022, the median income of upper-income households was 7.3 times that of lower-income households, compared to 6.3 times in 1970. For middle-income households, the ratio was 2.4 times in 2022, up from 2.2 in 1970.\n\nDemographics also play a role in income distribution. Children and adults over 65 are more likely to live in lower-income households. In 2022, 38% of children and 35% of adults 65 and older fell into this category, compared to 26% of adults aged 30 to 44 and 23% of those aged 45 to 64. Conversely, adults in their prime working years (30 to 64) were more likely to be in the upper-income bracket. The share of people living in upper-income households ranged from 13% among younger adults to 24% among those aged 45 to 64.\n\nGender differences are also evident. In 2022, men were slightly more likely than women to live in middle-income households (53% vs. 51%) and were more likely to be in upper-income households (18% vs. 16%).\n\nIn 2023, Fool.com offered a detailed breakdown of income classifications, providing insight into where different income levels stand, even within the middle class.\n\nMiddle class includes those in the 40th to 60th percentile of household income, with an income range of $55,001 to $89,744.\n\nUpper middle class covers the 60th to 80th percentile, with incomes between $89,745 and $149,131.\n\nUpper class comprises the top 20% of earners, with incomes of $149,132 or higher.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nConsider these figures when evaluating your own income status. Remember, this is just a snapshot in time \u2014 your earnings and class designation can change throughout your life.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet worth disparities further highlight the income divide. While the median net worth of upper-class households (income $149,132 or higher) is $805,400, those in the lower class have a median net worth of just $12,000.\n\nUnderstanding where your income places can provide valuable insight into your financial health and future prospects. Whether you're middle class, upper middle class, or upper class, these distinctions shape your economic reality and opportunities.\n\nTo maximize your financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice and strategies tailored to your goals.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Your Income Might Be Upper Class And You Don't Know It \u2014 Here's The Salary Needed To Reach 'Elite' Status originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "body": "The bull run in stocks may have further room for a stampede.\n\n\"We are in the early innings of a bull market where the earnings recovery story has barely begun,\" Bradesco BBI's head of equity strategy Ben Laidler told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nLaidler, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints at HSBC and JPMorgan, thinks there's a likelihood of two interest rate cuts this year from the Fed \u2014 which should fuel further investor excitement beyond expected strong earnings growth.\n\nThose factors could help lift stocks at least 100% over five years, Laidler contended.\n\n\"Earnings might easily compound at 15% a year if the economy keeps chugging along and you get a little bit of multiple expansion, which I think lower interest rates would justify,\u201d he said.\n\nThe current bull market for stocks is seen as starting in October 2022, when the S&P 500 (^GSPC) reached its most recent low. Since then, the index has gained a sizzling 55%. The index has gained nearly 17% so far this year, reaching its latest record on Friday.\n\nThe gains have been powered by enthusiasm around AI, which has driven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to record highs.\n\nThis year, the momentum has carried the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) beyond 40,000 and the S&P 500 beyond 5,000.\n\nThe S&P 500 is in the midst of the 16th strongest start to a year since 1950, according to data from Truist chief markets strategist Keith Lerner. The S&P 500 has now risen in seven of the past eight months.\n\nPart of Laidler's thesis will be put to the test this coming earnings season, which begins with results from banks such as JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\nFactSet pegs second quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies at 8.8%. If achieved, it will mark the highest year-over-year growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. It will also represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index.\n\nDouble-digit-percentage earnings growth is expected in the Communications Services (18.5%) and Information Technology (16.1%) sectors.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very fundamentally supported market. Earnings are recovering, and rate cuts are coming,\u201d added Laidler.\n\nThe outlook for AI stocks still looks strong despite big-time gains, Goldman Sachs portfolio manager Brook Dane said on Opening Bid.

They posted a video showing the receipt and noting, \u201cHere\u2019s what it takes to feed six kids [for] about a week and a half.\u201d It\u2019s been viewed more than 17 million times.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nBut Callahan, who works at a title-services company with her husband, told MarketWatch that the post was not meant to slam, Trader Joe\u2019s pricing. Its prices are some of the most competitive in her area, she said.\n\n\u201cTrader Joe\u2019s is a super cheap option where we live,\u201d the Los Angeles\u2013area resident told MarketWatch. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to get a grocery receipt that\u2019s the length of the CVS receipt that everybody jokes about. It\u2019s just the amount of items that we thought was so funny.\u201d\n\nCallahan mentioned that she does a lot of mental math when grocery shopping, and thinks about her family\u2019s food budget on a per-meal basis.\n\n\u201cA $444 grocery bill that lasts us about 10 days \u2014 that\u2019s three meals a day for eight people, that\u2019s $1.85 per meal per person,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are you going to eat for $1.85?\u201d\n\nLike many parents, Callahan stressed the importance of shopping around at grocery stores because it\u2019s typical for one store to have better prices for fruit, another to have better prices for meat, others to be better for bulk shopping.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do Vons, we\u2019ll also do Costco COST maybe once a month,\u201d she said. \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s has really inexpensive kids\u2019 snacks, their organic fruit is way cheaper, too.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Trader Joe\u2019s did not respond to MarketWatch\u2019s request for comment.\n\nSee: Home buyers who could barely afford their homes are a hit with TikTok viewers\n\nU.S. consumers are spending roughly 26% more on food than they did prior to the pandemic in 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Of course prices at grocery stores vary based on location, and high-cost-of-living areas tend to have higher food prices.\n\nConsumer-experience consultancy MarketForce Information took responses from 6,555 people about a variety of grocery-store topics, including which stores offered the best value for your money.\n\nSome grocery stores are more prevalent in certain areas of the country. For example, H-E-B has many locations in Texas, Food Lion tends to be located in southeastern states and Woodman\u2019s Markets are mainly located in the Midwest.\n\nRespondents said Aldi \u2014 with which Trader Joe\u2019s shares a corporate lineage \u2014 offered the best value for their money, followed by Woodman\u2019s Markets, WinCo Foods, Lidl and Market Basket.\n\nGrocery stores that customers say offer the best value for money. - Marketforce Information\n\nRead on: \u2018Our loyalty isn\u2019t worth anything\u2019: I paid $70 for a seat with more legroom, but two women grabbed similar empty seats for free.

        "title": "Here's What the Average Couple on Social Security Is Earning in 2024",
        "body": "Married couples typically have greater retirement expenses than single adults because they have to cover two people. That's twice as many groceries, twice the healthcare bills, and twice the goals you'll have to budget for.\n\nBut they also have an advantage when it comes to Social Security benefits. As long as at least one partner worked long enough to qualify, the couple will receive two monthly checks. Here's what that can add up to in annual income from the program.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat the average couple gets from Social Security right now\n\nThe average monthly retirement benefit as of May 2024 is $1,917 per month. If both spouses qualified for this amount, their household monthly benefits would be $3,834 per month, or about $46,000 per year. For most people, that'll go a long way toward covering their annual retirement expenses. They can supplement these benefits with personal savings or employment income.\n\nBut many couples don't get quite this much. If only one partner worked long enough to qualify for Social Security, the other cannot claim a retirement benefit of their own. However, they can claim a spousal benefit. This is up to one-half of the retirement benefit the worker qualifies for at their full retirement age. So if a couple received one average retirement benefit of $1,917 per month and one average spousal benefit of $911 per month, their total Social Security income would be $2,828 per month, or a little under $34,000 annually.\n\nBut even this is only a rough estimate. Most workers aren't going to qualify for the exact average benefit. And even those that do may get a different amount, depending on their age when they sign up.\n\nHow married couples can plan for Social Security in retirement\n\nUnderstanding how much you can expect from Social Security is key to budgeting effectively for retirement. It's often easiest to work this out by creating a my Social Security account.\n\nAfter verifying your identity, the account can tell you whether you've worked long enough to qualify for Social Security. If you have, there's a tool that estimates your monthly benefit at every possible claiming age. You can also tweak estimates of your future earnings if you want to see how a pay raise might affect your checks, for example.\n\nYou can apply for retirement benefits after turning 62, but if you want the full benefit you're entitled to, you must wait until your full retirement age (FRA). That's 66 to 67, depending on your birth year. Claiming early will shrink your benefit up to 30%, but you can also delay benefits beyond your FRA. Doing so will gradually increase your benefit (as much as 32%) until it maxes out at age 70.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpousal benefits are a bit trickier. Most people can also apply as early as 62 but only if your spouse is already claiming Social Security. If not, you must wait until they apply. Delaying Social Security will gradually increase your monthly benefit as well, but it maxes out when you reach FRA. So unlike retirement benefits, there are no additional gains to be had by delaying spousal benefits until age 70.\n\nThat said, if you qualify for both a retirement and spousal benefit, the Social Security Administration automatically gives you the larger of the two. If you're not sure which that will be, the my Social Security account again has tools that can help you estimate your benefits at all possible claiming ages.\n\nTalk with your spouse and figure out when each of you plans to apply for benefits. Once you know how much to expect in benefits, you can understand how much you'll need to save for retirement on your own.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

        "title": "3 Reliable Dividend Stocks With Yields Above 5% You Can Buy With $100 in July",
        "body": "The benchmark S&P 500 index keeps breaking new records thanks in large part to a handful of stocks at the top. Luckily for income-seeking investors, there are some highly reliable dividend stocks out there that haven't been swept up in the excitement.\n\nShares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC), and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) are reasonably valued, with an average dividend yield of about 7% at recent prices. Moreover, there's a good chance that all three can meet their commitments and continue raising them for many years to come.\n\nPfizer\n\nAt recent prices, Pfizer offers a juicy 6% yield, supported by profit from sales of innovative new drugs. The company has raised its dividend payout for 15 consecutive years, and it looks capable of maintaining this streak for at least another decade.\n\nPfizer reinvested some of the enormous profit its COVID-19 products generated into new sources of revenue that can keep its needle moving in the right direction. For example, the $43 billion acquisition of Seagen in 2023 gave it access to four commercial-stage cancer drugs, including Padcev.\n\nLast December, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Padcev for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with advanced-stage bladder cancer. New patients tend to stay on therapy much longer than folks who have already relapsed, so this label expansion could add billions to Pfizer's top line in the years ahead.\n\nIn addition to Padcev's label expansion, the FDA also approved a record nine new drugs from Pfizer last year. With plenty of new revenue sources, another decade of steady dividend raises seems likely.\n\nAres Capital\n\nAres Capital is a business development company (BDC), which means it has to distribute nearly all its profits to investors as a dividend. This BDC's dividend hasn't risen in a straight line, but it is up by 26% over the past decade.\n\nAt recent prices, the stock offers an eye-popping 9.2% yield and a good chance to see significantly more when you're ready to retire.\n\nFor decades, big American banks have been increasingly hesitant about lending to all but the largest businesses. As a result, Ares Capital and its BDC peers can always find midsize companies willing to accept relatively high-interest loans.\n\nAres Capital collected loan payments from 510 different companies in the first quarter. With an investment portfolio worth $23.1 billion, it's the largest publicly traded BDC. That means it has heaps of relationships with mid-market businesses and their private equity sponsors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith plenty of potential borrowers to choose from, Ares Capital's underwriting department can focus on those most likely to repay their debts. At the end of March, just 0.7% of investments were on non-accrual status.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is another large drugmaker, with a 15-year consecutive annual dividend-raising streak. At recent prices, the pharma stock offers a big 5.9% dividend yield and an excellent chance for further payout raises.\n\nShares of Bristol Myers Squibb are down largely because the company frightened investors with a drastically reduced earnings outlook for 2024. In February, management told investors it would earn between $7.10 and $7.40 per share this year. In April, the company slashed its 2024 earnings estimate to a range between $0.40 and $0.70 per share to account for $12.9 billion worth of in-process research and development expenses associated with recent acquisitions.\n\nIn the first quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb closed out acquisitions of Karuna Therapeutics, Mirati Therapeutics, and RayzeBio. Accounting for the acquisitions early is unusual, but it isn't a reason to avoid the stock.\n\nIn the first quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb's portfolio of more recently launched drugs grew sales by 11% if we ignore the negative effects of a stronger dollar.

        "title": "Statistics Say This Is the Best Age to Claim Social Security",
        "body": "When's the best age to begin collecting Social Security retirement benefits? That's a question the Social Security Administration (SSA) is asked frequently. The agency's answer: \"There's not a single 'best age' for everyone and, ultimately, it's your choice.\"\n\nThis response is correct. However, if you want to maximize how much money you receive from Social Security, there is an optimal answer for most Americans. Statistics say there's one best age to claim Social Security.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSocial Security's big trade-off\n\nThe earliest you can claim Social Security retirement benefits is age 62. Why shouldn't everyone begin collecting benefits as soon as possible? SSA imposes an early retirement penalty.\n\nFor every month you retire before your full retirement age (FRA) up to 36 months, your benefit will be reduced by five-ninths of 1%. If you retire more than 36 months before your FRA, your benefit will be reduced by five-twelfths of 1%. The full retirement age (FRA) for anyone born in 1960 or later is 67. This means that your retirement benefit for claiming at age 62 will be 30% lower than your benefit at age 67. Ouch.\n\nWhat's more, you can receive even higher benefits by holding off on collecting until you reach age 70. SSA offers a delayed retirement credit. For anyone born in 1943 and later, your retirement benefit will increase by two-thirds of 1%, or 8% per year. If you wait until age 70 to begin receiving retirement benefits, your benefits will be 24% higher than if you started receiving them at a full retirement age of 67.\n\nEvery American must consider Social Security's big trade-off in deciding when to claim retirement benefits. You can begin receiving your benefits sooner, but your monthly amount will be reduced. You can wait until later to receive a higher benefit, but you'll have to rely on other sources of income in the meantime.\n\nWhat a detailed study found\n\nQuite a few analyses have been conducted through the years about the optimal age for claiming Social Security retirement benefits. However, the most detailed and thorough one I've found was a study done by David Altig of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Laurence Kotlikoff and Victor Yifan Ye of Boston University. In November 2022, these three economists reported their findings in a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\nThis study used a statistical tool called the Fiscal Analyzer, developed by Economic Security Planning, Inc. The Fiscal Analyzer incorporated lifespan uncertainty, cash-flow constraints, and all major federal and state tax and transfer programs (notably Medicare and Medicaid).\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat did this detailed study find? Nearly every American (over 99%) who hasn't begun collecting Social Security retirement benefits should wait beyond age 65 to do so. More than 90% should wait to claim Social Security until age 70.\n\nTo be sure, most people don't wait until age 70 to collect their retirement benefits. Altig, Kotlikoff, and Ye noted that only 10.2% hold off that long. But claiming benefits earlier than 70 leaves a lot of money on the table.\n\nWhy defy the statistics?\n\nThe best age, statistically, to claim Social Security retirement benefits is 70. So why even consider defying the statistics? Two reasons especially stand out.\n\nFirst, you're not a statistic. You know your healthcare status better than economists analyzing aggregate data. If you think you won't live past your mid-70s because of poor health, family history, etc., collecting retirement benefits earlier could be the right decision for you.\n\nSecond, money isn't everything. You could place a higher value on being able to travel and do other things you'd like to do by claiming retirement benefits earlier than you do on increasing your monthly benefit.\n\nThe best age to start receiving retirement benefits varies from one individual to another. And SSA was right: Only you get to decide when's the right time for you.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

        "title": "Costco Is Up 32% in 2024: Could the Stock-Split Candidate Hit $1,000 per Share by the End of the Year?",
        "body": "Large- and megacap stocks have performed well in 2024. Retail giant Costco (NASDAQ: COST) hasn't missed the party with the stock up 32% year to date. Its chain of membership warehouse clubs is gaining market share in the United States and putting up strong growth across its in-person and e-commerce operations, impressing investors.\n\nAt $863 per share as of this writing, it could be a future stock-split candidate. Will the stock reach $1,000 by year-end, and is it a buy at these prices? Let's investigate.\n\nStrong growth and an incoming price hike?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a boon for retailers such as Costco. Revenue growth accelerated, pushing annual sales from $150 billion to $200 billion over just a few years. But unlike other retailers, Costco did not face a pandemic growth hangover. In fact, the company has continued to post strong growth and recently surpassed $250 billion in annualized sales.\n\nThe bottom line has followed suit with earnings per share (EPS) up close to 100% in the past five years. This strong growth has investors speculating a price hike is incoming for Costco's membership program. A membership currently costs $60 or $120, depending on the tier. There are well over 100 million members, and the company hasn't raised its membership price since 2017. Costco typically raises membership fees every five years or so, meaning the company is overdue for a price hike.\n\nWith high profit margins on the memberships themselves, a price hike could help Costco continue to grow its EPS over the next five years as well.\n\nForget $1,000 per share -- focus on valuation instead\n\nIt will require a 16% gain for Costco's share price to breach four-figure territory. Since the stock has already climbed by twice this amount in the first half of 2024, I don't doubt it's possible for Costco to surpass $1,000 before the end of the year.\n\nSuch a high stock price also makes Costco a stock-split candidate. Investors have recently seen Nvidia and Chipotle go through the process, and Costco's last stock split was in 2000.\n\nBut investors shouldn't focus on either of these things. Stock splits do not matter over the long term. A stock split just means there are more share of the same company available in the market. The actual stock price does not matter; what matters is valuation.\n\nAnd Costco's valuation has been climbing for years. It currently has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 53, close to an all-time high and well above its long-term average of 27.\n\nAt these levels, investors have very high expectations for Costco's future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nCOST PE Ratio Chart\n\nAvoid Costco stock (for now)\n\nCostco is a great business. Even with $250 billion of trailing-12-month sales, the company was able to grow comparable sales 6.5% in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 12). E-commerce sales were up 20.7% year over year. Earnings should continue to rise too, thanks to its track record of slow-and-steady growth.\n\nBut that's the issue: slow and steady. Costco is not a hypergrowth stock, but it's valued like one with a P/E ratio of more than 53.\n\nForget the stock split. Forget the potential for shares to reach $1,000 in the near term. It doesn't matter how great a business is if you have to pay too steep a premium to buy it: Price matters.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Costco Wholesale wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 High-Yield Energy Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in July",
        "body": "Finding high-yield stocks when the S&P 500 index is yielding a scant 1.3% may sound like a daunting task, but it isn't. You just need to be more discerning than usual when looking at massive yields, which often come with massive risks. Here are three high yields that are both attractively high and not laden with risk.\n\n1. Enterprise Products Partners is a rock in stormy seas\n\nThere's no way around it. Oil and natural gas are highly volatile commodities. But just because a company operates in the oil and gas industry doesn't mean it is risky.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and its hefty 7% distribution yield, is a perfect example. This master limited partnership (MLP) owns the vital energy infrastructure that helps move oil and natural gas around the world. It charges fees for the use of its assets, so demand for energy is more important than energy prices. Energy demand tends to be high regardless of where oil prices are.\n\nThat's the backstory behind Enterprise's streak of 25 consecutive annual distribution increases. It also has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet. And its distributable cash flow covers its distribution by 1.7 times, which means there's a lot of leeway for adversity before the distribution would be at risk.\n\nEnterprise isn't perfect; the yield is going to make up the lion's share of an investor's return. But slow and steady growth, coupled with that ultra-high yield, will likely be a highly rewarding outcome for those looking to maximize the income their portfolios generate.\n\n2. WEC Energy's regulated assets are changing shape\n\nWEC Energy (NYSE: WEC) is a regulated utility that provides electricity and natural gas to 4.7 million customers in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. The stock sports a 4.2% dividend yield backed by over two decades' worth of annual dividend increases. The payout has grown at an attractive 7% rate over the past decade which, the company happily explains, puts it in the top decile of the industry.\n\nWEC Energy's balance sheet carries an investment-grade credit rating, so it is financially strong. While that's important on the dividend front, more notable here is the growth potential of the business.\n\nThe utility is currently working on its largest capital investment plan ever, with an expectation to spend $23.7 billion over the next five years. That should help lead to earnings growth of between 6.5% and 7%, with the dividend likely to trail along with that growth. And one of the biggest drivers of the company's capital spending is its long-term shift away from coal toward cleaner energy sources, which is right in line with the broader trends in the utility industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, WEC Energy's yield is near its highest levels in a decade, suggesting it is on sale. If you are looking for a boring high-yield stock that can provide you with an attractive mix of yield and dividend growth, WEC Energy is one you need to be looking at right now.\n\n3. TotalEnergies mixes oil and renewables better than peers\n\nBut what if you actually want some direct exposure to oil and natural gas? That's where TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) and its 5% dividend yield come in. TotalEnergies is an integrated energy major and has one of the highest yields among its closest peers.\n\nBut what really sets the company apart is its aggressive push to diversify into cleaner energy options, like solar and wind power. At the same time it is upping its game in natural gas, a transition fuel, and fine-tuning its exposure to oil, focusing only on its best assets. All in, it is deftly using its historical business to take it well into the future.\n\nAnd it is doing it better than any of its closest competitors. ExxonMobil and Chevron are really doubling down on oil and gas. BP and Shell both made splashy announcements about going green, but paired that directional shift with dividend cuts.\n\nAnd neither of those two European peers have really pushed as hard as TotalEnergies, which didn't resort to a dividend cut. In fact, TotalEnergies' dividend easily survived the deep energy downturn that accompanied the economic shutdowns in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTotalEnergies' performance is going to be tied to the price of oil and natural gas. But if you are looking for that kind of exposure, with a bit of a clean-energy hedge, this could be the integrated energy giant for you.\n\nMake sure you understand the story\n\nThere are companies that have huge yields because their businesses are in trouble. Then there are companies that are misunderstood for some reason, which offer attractive yields backed by strong businesses. That's what you'll get with Enterprise, WEC Energy, and TotalEnergies. Don't delay -- all three look attractive as July gets underway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Enterprise Products Partners wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "I Pay a 1% Fee for Having $1.7M Invested With My Advisor. Am I Paying Too Much?",
        "body": "A financial advisor meets with a client in his office.\n\nWhen it comes to financial advice, what you pay can vary based on what you get. An advisor who simply sets you up with a passive S&P 500 index fund might not be worth a 1% fee, while an advisor who helps you manage taxes and cash flow, plan for retirement and save for your child\u2019s college education is likely worth significantly more.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in working with a financial advisor but don\u2019t know where to start, try SmartAsset\u2019s free tool to connect with fiduciary advisors who serve your area.\n\nFor example, say you have $1.7 million invested with a financial advisor. A 1% fee is within the average range for the industry, but whether you\u2019re getting a good deal will depend entirely on your advisor\u2019s skill and services.\n\nWhat Are Advisor Fees?\n\nFinancial advisors have several different ways of structuring their fees. The most common types of fees are:\n\nHourly : A fixed rate that\u2019s charged for every hour worked.\n\nFixed : A predetermined amount that you pay for a specific service.\n\nPercentage of AUM : A variable rate based on a percent of the total assets under management (AUM), typically billed annually or quarterly.\n\nCommissions and performance fees: Commissions are fees your advisor receives for specific trades or transactions they make, while performance-based fees apply when they meet certain goals.\n\nToday, fees that are based on a percentage of a client\u2019s AUM are the most common type of advisory fee. A 2022 study by Kitces found that AUM fees were the majority revenue source for 82% of financial advisors surveyed. Here\u2019s how they work: say for example that an advisor charges 0.5% annually and they manage a $100,000 portfolio. At the end of the year, you would have paid $500 ($100,000 * 0.005) in management fees, which may have been taken directly from your account.\n\nFixed and hourly rates are more common for advisors who perform specific services. For example, if a financial advisor does your taxes or makes a plan for college savings, they may bill by the hour or charge you a flat rate for those services.\n\nBut if you need help finding a financial advisor, consider matching with one using this free tool.\n\nWhat Do You Get For Your Fees?\n\nA financial advisor meets with a client in her office.\n\nFinancial advisors can provide a range of services.\n\nFlat- and hourly-fee structures are generally built around specific deliverables. For example, some advisors will help you to create a tax strategy, a household budget or an overall financial plan. It\u2019s also common for a financial advisor to offer a comprehensive range of financial services based on what you need to achieve.\n\nAUM-based fees are typically associated with ongoing portfolio management. Advisors who manage client portfolios typically select investments, moving money according to a pre-determined strategy. Percentage-based fees seek to align your advisor\u2019s incentives with your own. The more they grow your money, the more assets they will have under management and, in turn, the larger their fee can potentially be.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, higher fees do not always translate to better results. As a prospective client, you should carefully review what you receive for your money. If you want comprehensive financial services, how much does the advisor charge for each deliverable? If you want money management, how have their portfolios performed year-over-year? Make sure you\u2019re getting value for your money because even small percentage fees can add up.\n\nWhether you need ongoing portfolio management or standalone financial planning, evaluate those needs and then connect with a fiduciary financial advisor who offers those services.\n\nWhat Should You Pay?\n\nA financial advisor goes over his fee structure with two prospective clients.\n\nThe typical percentage-based fee that\u2019s often cited is 1% of AUM, although an AdvisoryHQ analysis found that average fees for portfolio management range from 0.59% to 1.18% of AUM. The exact rate you\u2019ll pay can depend on several factors, including the services bundled within that fee. For example, a financial advisor might charge more if the AUM fee also includes tax preparation and financial planning, while they might charge less if the fee only accounts for portfolio management.\n\nRobo-advisors, digital platforms that manage your portfolio automatically using an algorithm, tend to be significantly cheaper. These services generally charge between 0% to 0.89% percent of assets under management, according to Robo Adviser Pros. However, they also offer fewer services. A robo-advisor will manage your portfolio around specific metrics, but generally can\u2019t offer customized advice or services like financial planning and tax advice.\n\nFor a wealthy household, it\u2019s also important to consider asset-based discounts. Many financial advisors use graduated fee schedules with lower rates that apply to larger sums of money. For example, an advisor may charge a 1.5% fee on the first $250,000 in a portfolio and a 1% fee on the next $250,000. That advisor could charge just 0.75% to manage the next $500,000, meaning a $1 million portfolio woul qualify for a discount based on its sheer size.\n\nIf you have $1.7 million and are paying 1% in advisor fees, ultimately it\u2019s important to ask what you\u2019re getting for your money. This fee adds up to $17,000 per year, which may be reasonable given the level of service you receive and your satisfaction with the advisor.\n\nIf you currently have an advisor but want to find a new person to work with, this free tool can help you connect with a fiduciary advisor who serves your area.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOn average, financial advisors charge between 0.59% and 1.18% of assets under management for their asset management. At 1%, an advisor\u2019s fee is well within the industry average. Whether that fee is too much or just right depends entirely on what you think of the advisor\u2019s services and performance.\n\nTips for Picking an Advisor\n\nIs it worth paying a financial advisor 1%? This small percentage really can add up to a lot of money over time, so make sure to review what you\u2019re getting from that relationship in exchange for these fees.\n\nFinding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/shapecharge, \u00a9iStock.com/filadendron, \u00a9iStock.com/scyther5\n\nThe post I Have $1.7M Invested With My Advisor and I Pay a 1% Fee.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has done a lot over the past five years. Five years ago, it was nearing the bottom of a cycle thanks to a collapse in the cryptocurrency market. Now, it's reaching new highs as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for creating artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nWhile it would have been nearly impossible to predict all of the places Nvidia has gone over the past five years, I'm going to speculate on where it could go in the next five years. Although this prediction will likely be wrong in some ways, it's good at least to develop an investment thesis for the market's most dominant company right now.\n\nNvidia's best-in-class GPUs are about to face some competition\n\nNvidia's GPUs are -- hands down - the best in class. There's a reason why all of the biggest companies that provide the tools to make AI models or create them in-house are using Nvidia GPUs nearly exclusively. However, that exclusivity may be dwindling.\n\nBecause GPUs can do multiple calculations in parallel, they are fantastic for creating AI models. However, if the only thing that the GPU will be doing is training AI models, more efficient hardware is available. For instance, Google Cloud's tensor processing unit (TPU) is more effective at training AI models than a GPU if the workload is set up to be run on a TPU.\n\nThis still leaves a use case for GPUs, which are fantastic for running initial models. However, custom-designed AI chips like TPUs can exceed the performance of GPUs when they are used for a specific purpose.\n\nGoogle Cloud isn't the only one creating these custom chips. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Meta Platforms are also creating their own custom-designed chips. This could present a problem for Nvidia over the next five years, as many of its largest customers are bringing these designs in-house. Demand for Nvidia GPUs will still likely be high, but it may not be as high as it is now.\n\nOn the plus side for Nvidia, all of the record-setting number of GPUs it has sold over the past year will eventually need to be replaced. While there is no hard and fast rule, it's common for these GPUs to last between three and five years in a data center. After that, they'll either need to be replaced (whether by some in-house design or Nvidia's latest product) or decommissioned.\n\nThe computing power to run these models continuously isn't going away, so decommissioning these GPUs isn't an option. This will create essentially a long-term subscription effect, and five years from now, Nvidia will likely see another wave of replacing the products it is selling right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not to mention all of the technological improvements that will likely be made from now until then, as new chip technology (like Taiwan Semiconductor's 2-nanometer chip technology that will be more efficient than the previous generation) will create more powerful and efficient GPUs that will help its users out over the long run.\n\nBut is all of that already baked into the stock price?\n\nNvidia's profit margins are ripe for competition\n\nIt's no secret that Nvidia's stock is expensive. The shares trade at 73 times trailing and 46 times forward earnings, which means significant growth is already priced into the stock.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's record margins are not often discussed. Nvidia's near-60% profit-margin levels are unbelievable and are a primary reason why many companies are starting to design their chips in-house.\n\nNVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBecause demand for Nvidia's GPUs is so high right now, the company can afford to charge a premium for its products. Eventually, that won't be the case, and its profit margins will likely fall over the next five years.\n\nWhen that happens, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio will increase due to earnings either growing at a slower pace or falling. This is a huge risk associated with the stock, as the market believes Nvidia's revenue will keep going straight up forever.\n\nWhile demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain elevated, don't be surprised when Nvida faces challenges with in-house solutions in the next few years. There's an old saying that a company's margins are a competitor's opportunity, and when Nvidia's margins reach these levels, there's bound to be competition soon.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's stock may face some pressure over the next five years. This unbelievable demand boom won't last forever, and the opportunity is just too large for every company to sit still and watch Nvidia take their money.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "AMD Might Not Beat Nvidia, but Here's Why It's Still a Long-Term Buy",
        "body": "With a 90% market share, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reigns as the undisputed King of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip market. Yet, in an ironic twist, the company's very success has created favorable conditions for its rivals to take down the AI titan a notch or two from atop its perch. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) realizes the opportunity a supply-constrained Nvidia has presented and intends to fully exploit these fortuitous circumstances to its advantage.\n\nWhy the Nvidia spillover effect creates unparalleled opportunities for AMD\n\nNvidia's unprecedented revenue growth, its rising stock price and consequential market capitalization have all demonstrated that the AI infrastructure market is sustainable and unbounded. Hyper-demand for Nvidia's chips has dispelled any lingering doubts that AI mania is merely another dot.com bubble waiting to burst.\n\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU)chips are the lifeblood of generative AI systems. Semiconductor companies, such as AMD, provide the essential chip architecture capabilities necessary to create and sustain such systems. Tech companies that build or design these indispensable components are the only businesses at present able to convert the AI hype into an appreciable revenue reality.\n\nHardware companies such as Dell and Lenovo, as well as cloud providers, need AI chips immediately at competitive prices to meet rising customer demand. They can't secure chips from Nvidia fast enough, which means buying GPU hardware from other sources.\n\nRealizing the profit potential presented by this current supply and demand imbalance, AMD has stepped into this supply void swiftly. It has seized this opportunity by quickly ramping up production of its AI GPU series 1300 processors as an alternative to Nvidia's offerings for a tech sector hungry for data center chips.\n\nAMD looks poised to grow its AI presence\n\nLike other semiconductor companies, over the past two years, AMD has suffered from a chip glut that is only now starting to dissipate as tech companies wind down their excess inventories. Poor performance in the company's two non-data center segments resulted in tepid overall revenue growth of 2% year-over-year.The company's gaming segment was down 48% year-over-year; its embedded segment, which provides processing needs for the industrial, automotive and testing industries, fell 46% year-over-year.\n\nThe more telling metric for ascertaining the company's prospects, however, is the astounding growth in the company's data center business. Revenues from this segment grew an astounding 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. The client segment, which provides CPUs for servers, laptops, mobile and desktop devices, surged 85% to $1.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccelerated growth from the data center and client segments prompted the company to raise its full-year 2024 guidance from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion. CEO Lisa Su stated that based on customer engagements, these estimates are realistic.\n\nOver time, earnings from AMD's cloud GPU sales will far surpass that of the two non-data center segments that have dragged down overall revenue.\n\nA compelling investment opportunity for long-term appreciation\n\nGiven its flat year-over-year revenue growth, at 46 times the next twelve months' earnings, AMD's current valuation appears to be stretched. At 47 for the same multiple, Nvidia barely beats AMD by this same metric, even though its recent growth rate has been much greater.\n\nSince it's categorized as a semiconductor stock, AMD's current valuation, however, doesn't fully reflect its long-term revenue potential. For a company just entering the AI GPU business, AMD's data center growth was off the charts. The market will continue to respond favorably to AMD's offerings because cloud providers welcome the competition. Many don't want to be locked into Nvidia's ecosystem.\n\nBy some estimates, the AI market could grow to $403 billion by 2027 and $1 trillion by 2030. These projections demonstrate the extent to which AMD can benefit from AI's long-term revenue potential.\n\nCloud providers want competitive chip pricing which opens a wide door for AMD and others to carve into Nvidia's market share. With its focused AI data center strategy, over time, AMD's valuation as an AI stock will grow, as the company's increasing earnings reveal that its long-term AI growth potential is sustainable.\n\nInvestors shouldn't expect any short-term gains from the stock. Purchasing AMD is suitable only for those with a long-term investment horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Energy Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential",
        "body": "The global economy has been steadily transitioning to renewable energy over the years. The pace has quickened in recent years, powered by falling costs and government incentives. Demand for renewables could further accelerate in the future, fueled by a surging need for power by technology companies for cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nThese trends play right into the hands of leading renewable energy producers NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP), and Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A). It makes them great energy stocks to buy and hold for their long-term total return potential.\n\nA powerful wealth creator\n\nNextEra Energy has been a wealth-creating machine over the years. The leading U.S. utility has generated an 11.4% annualized total return over the last 15 years. That has outpaced other utilities (6.8% annualized total return) and the S&P 500 (10.5%).\n\nPowering its returns has been its steadily rising earnings and dividend. Its adjusted earnings per share have increased at a 9% compound annual rate over the last decade, while its dividend has grown at a 10% compound annual rate. NextEra has benefited from the steady growth in power demand from utility customers in Florida, its investments in renewable energy, and accretive acquisitions.\n\nThose catalysts should continue powering above-average growth. NextEra expects to increase its adjusted earnings per share at or near the upper end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through at least 2027. Meanwhile, it expects to grow its dividend (which yields almost 3%) at a 10% annual rate through 2026.\n\nIts longer-term outlook is just as bright, given the immense need for renewable energy in the future. It expects new renewables and storage capacity additions to be three times more over the next seven years, compared to the past seven years.\n\nHigh-powered growth potential\n\nBrookfield Renewable has grown briskly over the years. The leading global renewable energy company delivered 12% compound annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share since 2016. Meanwhile, it has increased its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate over the last two decades.\n\nThe company should continue generating high-powered earnings and income growth. Brookfield Renewable expects a trio of organic drivers (inflation-indexed rate increases, margin enhancement activities, and its vast development pipeline) to power 7% to 12% annual FFO per share growth through 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, it expects accretive acquisitions to drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. The company recently agreed to acquire a European renewable energy developer with a large pipeline of projects in various stages of development. These growth drivers will give Brookfield plenty of power to achieve its aim of increasing its dividend (which yields around 5%) by 5% to 9% each year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother factor powering its view is its growing portfolio of sustainable solutions. Brookfield has built platforms in the carbon capture and storage, biofuel production, recycling, nuclear services, and solar panel manufacturing segments. These investments add to its long-term growth potential.\n\nHigh-end dividend growth ahead\n\nClearway Energy is one of the country's largest producers of renewable energy. It also has a portfolio of cleaner-burning natural gas power-generating facilities. These assets produce lots of stable cash flow, which Clearway pays out via a high-yielding dividend (recently approaching 6%).\n\nThe company expects to increase its payout toward the high end of its 5% to 8% annual target range through 2026. It has already secured and funded nearly all that growth. Clearway sold its thermal assets a few years ago and has been recycling the proceeds into higher-returning renewable energy investments. The company has committed to deploy or has line-of-sight on enough new investments to deliver on its dividend growth target.\n\nMeanwhile, Clearway has growing visibility into its ability to increase its dividend beyond 2026. It has been renewing contracts on its natural gas power plants at high-enough rates to support low-end dividend growth in 2027. In addition, it sees several opportunities to add battery storage to its existing wind and solar projects. On top of that, it has a strategic relationship with a leading renewable energy developer, which should continue providing it with new investment opportunities.\n\nPlugged into a powerful growth megatrend\n\nRenewable energy demand should continue growing briskly in the coming decades. That should enable NextEra Energy, Brookfield Renewable, and Clearway Energy to increase their earnings and dividends at healthy rates.\n\nThose growth drivers position these top energy stocks to generate strong total returns for investors over the long term. That makes them great stocks to buy and hold for long-term potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nAs everyday prices continue to rise, more shoppers are looking for ways to trim their spending. One option is joining a Costco warehouse club to shop for the best deals.\n\nBut you must pay a membership fee to have the privilege of shopping here. The retailer has two membership types: a Gold Star membership and the pricier Executive membership, which offers more benefits like 2% back on most purchases.\n\nBefore investing in an Executive membership, consider whether you'll use the extra membership perks. Here are a few lesser-known benefits of a Costco Executive membership.\n\n1. Save more money when you order checks\n\nIf you need to order checks, an Executive Membership can help you save even more money. Costco partners with Harland Clarke to provide check-printing services to its members. As a bonus, all check orders include free, trackable standard delivery.\n\n2. Access additional travel benefits\n\nYou'll also get access to additional travel perks as an Executive member. All members get access to the same travel booking rates. But Executive members can get additional extras on select Costco Travel bookings.\n\nThis may include complimentary room upgrades, food and drink credits, and spa credits.

        "title": "How the IRS is using a bigger budget \u2014 and more \u2018swagger\u2019 \u2014 to audit more rich taxpayers. \u2018They are pushing hard now.\u2019",
        "body": "The taxman isn\u2019t playing around, lawyers, accountants and tax specialists say \u2014 the IRS is ramping up enforcement. Here\u2019s what that looks like on the receiving end. - MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto\n\nAnyone on the receiving end of an IRS audit will say there\u2019s never a good time to open up the books for Uncle Sam\u2019s revenue agents.\n\nThat\u2019s never felt more true, say people who\u2019ve witnessed the Internal Revenue Service in action recently.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nIRS auditors have more questions, more staff and are acting more assertive, according to lawyers and accountants who advise very upscale clients on taxes.\n\nIn 2022\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS landed billions of dollars in funding over a decade to make sure rich households, partnerships and corporations were paying all of their owed taxes. The funding was intended to revive sagging audit rates at an agency that\u2019s been slowly sapped of money and people over the past decade.\n\nSince then, the agency has been publicizing its efforts to collect back taxes from delinquent millionaires and to rake in tax returns that millionaires failed to file.\n\nThe IRS has also talked about combing through corporate-jet records and using artificial intelligence to spot tax returns worth scrutiny. Most recently, the agency announced an effort to stop a \u201cshell game\u201d that large, complex partnerships allegedly use to churn up tax deductions.\n\nNow, tax professionals are seeing that talk turn into action.\n\n\u201cRight after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, I started seeing increased swagger, for lack of a better word. For a while, it seemed like just swagger,\u201d said Robert Kovacev, a member at the law firm Miller & Chevalier. His clients include corporations, partnerships and ultrarich families worth between millions and billions of dollars.\n\n\u201cFor the first time really now, I\u2019m starting to see the effects of the funding,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nThe \u201cswagger\u201d that Kovacev sees now is displayed in the extra questions he has to field from the IRS, increasingly on topics that weren\u2019t part of an audit\u2019s starting scope.\n\nBefore the Inflation Reduction Act, Kovacev said the IRS was already viewing high-net-worth families as economic \u201centerprises\u201d with a sprawling financial footprint where tax noncompliance could sprout in all sorts of ways.\n\nStory continues\n\nA family\u2019s trusts, companies, partnership interests and charitable-giving tactics might all be places where auditors could poke and prod. \u201cBut without the resources they needed, there was only so much they could do,\u201d he said.\n\nNow he sees IRS agents ready to veer farther and farther from the audit\u2019s beginning focus. \u201cIt was kind of rare if you had an exam team color outside of the lines,\u201d Kovacev said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make that assumption anymore.\u201d\n\nIRS agents combing through a massive tax return have \u201can infinite number of avenues [they] can follow, but can\u2019t follow all of them,\u201d Kovacev noted. \u201cSometimes you find things worth exploring, but you let go. They are starting not to let those go so quickly.\u201d\n\nIRS auditors are digging deeper\n\nNiles Elber, a member at law firm Caplin & Drysdale, said IRS auditors seem willing to dig deeper these days. \u201cI might describe it as eagerness,\u201d he said. There are millions of dollars hanging in the balance in the tax cases he handles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time now,\u201d Elber said. \u201cWhen I first started, the agents I worked with usually concentrated on the most important things or the most important issues, usually with the most significant financial impact. And other things that were less significant were pushed by the wayside as a means of economizing. I\u2019m not sure I see that now. Now, we\u2019re going to drill down on everything.\u201d\n\nThe IRS isn\u2019t \u2018outgunned\u2019 anymore\n\nAfter years of budget cuts and shrinking staff, the IRS had been falling behind on its high-level enforcement, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said at a recent tax conference. In 2021, his predecessor, Charles Rettig, said the agency was getting \u201cout-gunned.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s changing now, but it\u2019s \u201ca long process,\u201d Werfel said.\n\n\u201c[W]e have to have the patience to be playing the long game,\u201d according to Werfel, who occasionally refers to complex audits as a chess game.\n\n\u201cSo many of the taxpayers at this end of the spectrum are doing the right thing and playing by the rules. But there are a material number of taxpayers that are not,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans fear the IRS will run roughshod over taxpayers\n\nWhile debates heat up on the future of tax laws and tax revenue to fill a gaping federal budget deficit, it\u2019s important to understand what the IRS is doing to try to extract more money through existing laws. It\u2019s also important to remember that a stronger audit flex from a more muscular IRS has its critics.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act passed in a Democratic-controlled Congress without any Republican votes in support. The law awarded $80 billion to the IRS over a decade to replenish its ranks and upgrade operations. More than half of the sum was earmarked for tighter tax enforcement.\n\nThe IRS plans to boost audits on taxpayers worth at least $400,000 under a Treasury Department directive that came days before President Joe Biden signed the bill into law. Below the $400,000 mark, the IRS will not use the extra funding to increase audit rates from historical levels, the directive said. Specifically, the benchmark is the audit rates on 2018 returns, Werfel has said.\n\nThe enforcement money has been a flash point for Republicans, who have successfully negotiated just over $20 billion out of the Inflation Reduction Act funding.\n\nRepublicans say they don\u2019t want an IRS that runs roughshod over taxpayers. Many aren\u2019t convinced that the agency really will confine its attention to wealthier earners. Democrats counter that Republicans just want to take the heat off well-heeled tax cheats.\n\nThe fight over the IRS budget continues, with House Republicans looking to reduce enforcement-related money in the upcoming budget year.\n\n\u2018The breeze before the storm\u2019\n\nWith the IRS stepping up enforcement on upper-income taxpayers, Michael Sardar, a partner handling tax disputes at the law firm Kostelanetz, is already getting calls from crypto investors who may have underreported their gains to the IRS, longtime nonfilers (meaning people who have repeatedly failed to file tax returns) and others worried they might be in the agency\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nThey\u2019re asking how to get their taxes in order and come clean with the tax agency before IRS notices arrive and make their tax situation worse, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite right to call this period \u201cthe calm before the storm,\u201d according to Sardar. There\u2019s a better way to describe the moment, he said: \u201cThe breeze before the storm.\u201d\n\nMore IRS staff means more questions to answer during audits\n\nWhat does that storm feel like to the people who are either getting audited, or are worried about it?\n\nAround the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s passage, one assertion from GOP critics was that the IRS would be hiring a new phalanx of aggressive auditors. Overall, the agency now has nearly 90,000 full-time equivalent employees, up from 79,000 in fiscal year 2022, thanks to the new funding. Almost 9,100 of those are revenue agents \u2014 the employees who conduct audits.\n\nThe plan is to bring the IRS\u2019s head count for its entire staff to 102,500 in fiscal year 2029, Werfel said last month, noting that\u2019s still under the IRS\u2019s head count in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The agency\u2019s hiring goal \u201cshould lay to rest any lingering myth about a super-sized IRS,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nStill, a common refrain about high-end IRS audits these days is that there are more people involved \u2014 and having more people means answering more questions.\n\nElber used to work with one or two IRS agents during an audit, with one being the lead agent and the other serving as a specialist or supervisor.\n\nNow, the exam teams can have up to eight people, he said. He\u2019s also noticed a new feature: recurring conference calls for updates on the audit. \u201cAcross the board, they are pushing hard now. They are moving cases along with deliberate speed,\u201d Elber said.\n\nOnce a tax return is filed, the IRS says it generally has three years to assess extra tax. It may go back further if auditors uncover a glaring error, but it says it typically doesn\u2019t look back any further than six years. The exam concludes with an IRS recommendation on how much more money the taxpayer owes the government.\n\nThe agency may not necessarily suggest an adjustment, but says it tries to minimize these \u201cno-change\u201d audits that bog down taxpayers who have followed the rules.\n\nIf the IRS and the taxpayer can\u2019t agree on the size of the extra bill, the process can move to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals or an array of federal courts.\n\nIRS is reaching for new audit goals\n\nThe tax agency is trying to make 2026 a milestone. When tax returns are filed for that year, the IRS wants to be auditing 16.5% of households with a total positive income of at least $10 million, up from 11%.\n\nIn 2020, the Trump administration\u2019s Treasury Department directed the IRS to audit at least 8% of taxpayers worth $10 million. The IRS kept up with that goal in returns filed for 2018, 2019 and 2020, a recent Treasury watchdog report found.\n\nBut the IRS said it isn\u2019t following the 2020 directive anymore because it views the goal as out of date, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report said.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate income-tax returns filed for 2026, the IRS plans to examine more than 22% of tax returns for corporations with assets of at least $250 million.\n\nBy then, it plans to audit 1% of partnership returns with at least $10 million in assets. The IRS already said it\u2019s launching 76 audits of lucrative partnerships, including certain law firms, hedge funds and real-estate investment trusts.\n\nA 1% target may sound humble, but it\u2019s a 900% increase from the 0.1% audit rate in 2019 for these large partnerships, where the earnings pass through the business to the partners in tax arrangements that can become extremely complicated.\n\n\u2018How do I make sure I\u2019m the smallest target?\u2019\n\nThe best defense against an audit may be minimizing its chances in the first place.\n\n\u201cPeople are really thinking about \u2018How do I make sure I\u2019m the smallest target I can be?\u2019\u201d said Jane Ditelberg, senior vice president and tax-planning director at the Northern Trust Institute.\n\nNo matter the taxpayer\u2019s income level, avoiding the red flags that could spark an audit still largely boils down to the basics: Make sure all income is reported and make sure all the math is correct on a return, she said.\n\nSteer clear of tax techniques where the IRS has already announced its skepticism, she added. That includes not falling for a \u201cweird\u201d reading of a U.S.-Malta tax treaty that lulls people into thinking they\u2019ve shielded their retirement money from U.S. taxes. Elsewhere, be extra careful to follow all instructions on \u201creportable transactions\u201d where the IRS is on guard for misuse, Ditelberg noted. Massive monetary losses are one example of a reportable transaction.\n\nThe Schedule C tax form for business profits and losses can be a trouble spot if there are chronic losses. The IRS may think the venture is a hobby instead of a bona fide business with deductions and losses that can legitimately offset income.\n\nIn the rarified world of upper-income taxpayers, the IRS may have questions about whether a taxpayer\u2019s ranch really is a working ranch, or if their yacht leasing is something other than a side endeavor. Questions about the real value of upscale, difficult-to-value charitable donations \u2014 like a donated weekend stay at a vacation home \u2014 could attract unwanted attention if not handled correctly, Ditelberg said.\n\nAt Kostelanetz, a growing share of Sardar\u2019s work is advising people on how they can get their taxes in order before the IRS shows up. He\u2019s already well acquainted with the IRS\u2019s voluntary disclosure practice, where he helps people get on the right side of the IRS after they fess up to their unreported income and work out a deal with the agency on the consequences.\n\nThere are now people contacting Sardar who haven\u2019t filed tax returns in years, sometimes decades. \u201cThose are people who thought for a long time, \u2018I\u2019m off the radar,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to be reassessing that comfort. They seem to be realizing or recognizing it\u2019s a false comfort.\u201d\n\nIs the IRS\u2019s focus on auditing high-income taxpayers fair?\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Many Americans may not hold much sympathy for rich people and businesses that are spending money to duel with the taxman over their bill.\n\nBut the IRS itself says taxpayers have a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d That includes the right to a \u201cfair and just tax system\u201d and \u201cthe right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax.\u201d\n\nAt the conference earlier this month, Werfel said tougher enforcement is a win for overall fairness and a victory for those who follow the rules.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a CFO or CEO and you run a large company, a multinational company, and you are playing by the rules, you want an IRS that makes sure your competitors are playing by the rules and that there\u2019s an even playing field,\u201d he said.\n\nAn audit is one way to do that, but Kovacev said the process can be \u201ca fishing expedition.\u201d The Inflation Reduction Act \u201cgave the IRS a bigger license to fish,\u201d he noted.\n\nIt\u2019s fair game to use the new funding to catch people who are not paying the IRS what they owe, he added. Yet the $400,000 pledge aims the IRS net squarely at his clients.\n\n\u201cYou have to wonder, are they going after where the money is? Or are they going where the politicians want them to go?\u201d Kovacev said.\n\nCaplin & Drysdale\u2019s Elber said it\u2019s a good thing if more IRS audits and investigations bring the system to a place where everyone is paying all their tax obligations. \u201cYou want there to be fairness and uniformity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trick is knowing when enough is enough \u2014 so there\u2019s a balance the IRS needs to find within itself, he added.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t believe in is grinding a taxpayer to dust and looking at every possible issue one could look at,\u201d Elber said.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch",

        "title": "Is Now the Time to Buy Micron Technology Stock?",
        "body": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has exploded over the past year, and among the businesses benefiting from this growth is Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). The company's sales are soaring because AI systems require lots of computer memory and storage, exactly the products Micron specializes in.\n\nThis led to an amazing run-up in the company's share price. Last July, Micron stock was at a 52-week low of $60.50. Fast-forward a year, and shares more than doubled to hit a high of $157.54 in June.\n\nBut after announcing results for its fiscal third quarter, ended May 30, Micron's stock price plunged. Does this create an opening to buy shares, or does the price drop suggest a reason to avoid investing in Micron?\n\nHere's a look into the company's performance to answer those questions and determine if Micron is a worthwhile investment over the long run.\n\nMicron's financial performance\n\nMicron's post-earnings share price decline was due to its fiscal Q4 financial forecast failing to impress Wall Street. The company estimated Q4 revenue to come in around $7.6 billion, which is a 90% increase over the prior year's $4 billion.\n\nTo put this guidance into context, here's how Micron's revenue has fared over its fiscal 2024.\n\nFiscal Quarter Revenue YOY Change Q4 2024 $7.6 billion (company guidance) 90% Q3 2024 $6.8 billion 82% Q2 2024 $5.8 billion 58% Q1 2024 $4.7 billion 16%\n\nData source: Micron Technology. YOY = year-over-year.\n\nAs you can see, Micron's revenue has been growing every quarter this fiscal year, thanks to the customer demand generated by the advent of AI. And looking deeper at Micron's fiscal Q3, performance was solid across multiple financial metrics.\n\nThe company's Q3 free cash flow (FCF) of $425 million is a substantial reversal from last year's negative FCF of $1.4 billion.\n\nIn addition, Micron exited Q3 with a healthy balance sheet. Total assets were $66.3 billion with $7.6 billion in cash and equivalents. Total liabilities were $22 billion.\n\nMicron's current demand environment\n\nOverall, Micron had a good third quarter, and its streak of rising revenue looks poised to continue because of the growing AI market. The AI industry is forecasted to expand from 2023's $136 billion to $827 billion by 2030.\n\nMicron is capturing its share of this market. In fact, Micron management stated its high-bandwidth memory chips, needed for AI to process data and make complex calculations, are already sold out for this year and 2025 as well.\n\nGiven the robust demand environment, Micron raised prices. As a result, the company's gross margin has grown, increasing from 19% in fiscal Q2 to 27% in Q3. Micron expects its gross margin to go up yet again in Q4 to around 34%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for its products coupled with the AI market's rapid growth led CFO Mark Murphy to state Micron expects \"record revenue and significantly better profitability in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nTo buy or not to buy Micron stock\n\nMicron is on a roll right now. But in evaluating it as a long-term investment, it's important to note Micron operates in a cyclical industry. This means while AI provides a boost today, at some point, the company will eventually face an industry downturn.\n\nFor example, in Q2 of its 2023 fiscal year, revenue dropped over 50% to $3.7 billion from the previous year's $7.8 billion. At the time, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra explained this by saying, \"The semiconductor memory and storage industry is facing its worst downturn in the last 13 years.\"\n\nNow, the company's fortunes have reversed, and with the AI market in the early years of expansion, Micron is well positioned to continue growing revenue.\n\nThat growth led Mehrotra to declare that \"Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI.\"\n\nDespite Wall Street's disappointment with Micron's Q4 guidance, the current consensus among Wall Street analysts is a buy rating with a median share price of $165 for Micron stock. This suggests a belief the share price will go up.\n\nGiven AI's multiyear tailwind to Micron's sales growth, and with shares down after its recent earnings report, now is a good time to buy Micron stock and hold it over the long term as the AI market expands.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Warren Buffett Has 99% of His Money Invested in 1 Brilliant Stock",
        "body": "Warren Buffett is currently the tenth-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In June 2024, Buffett not only estimated his net worth at more than $127 billion, but also candidly mentioned that 99% of that total was invested in a single stock: Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nBuffett acquired an ownership stake in Berkshire about six decades ago, and his considerable investing prowess has molded the company into a diversified conglomerate worth $875 billion. Under his leadership, Berkshire shares compounded at 19.8% annually between 1965 and 2023, nearly doubling the annualized return in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the same period.\n\nBuffett is undoubtedly one of the greatest minds in American business, which makes his conviction in Berkshire all the more noteworthy. Here's what investors should know about this brilliant stock.\n\nBerkshire has two important advantages\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is a holding company that owns dozens of subsidiaries that fall into three segments: (1) insurance, (2) railroad, utilities, and energy, and (3) manufacturing, service, and retailing. The structure of the business is advantageous for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies in the world. As a result, it consistently generates investable cash in the form of insurance premiums. Warren Buffett explained that facet of the business in his 2009 shareholder letter.\n\n\"Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers' compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums -- money we call \"float\" -- that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire's benefit.\"\n\nBuffett has invested that float to great effect over the years. Berkshire's book value per share, a good yardstick for measuring changes in its intrinsic value, has increased at 11.1% annually over the last decade.\n\nThe second reason Berkshire's business structure is advantageous is that many of its subsidiaries provide goods and services that are somewhat recession-proof. That is particularly true of those involved in insurance underwriting (Geico), freight rail transportation (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), and utility services (Pilot and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company).\n\nAs a result, Berkshire Hathaway has historically outperformed the S&P 500 during bear markets, as shown in the chart below.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear Market Start Date S&P 500 Maximum Decline Berkshire Hathaway Maximum Decline March 2000 (49%) (24%) October 2007 (57%) (54%) February 2020 (34%) (30%) January 2022 (25%) (27%) Average (41%) (34%)\n\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\n\nBerkshire reported solid financial results in the first quarter\n\nBerkshire looked stalwart in the first quarter. Revenue increased 5% to $89.9 billion due to strong sales growth in the insurance and utilities subsidiaries, offset by modest sales declines across subsidiaries in other segments. Meanwhile, operating earnings before income tax increased 31% to $12.5 billion.\n\nThe graphic below shows Berkshire's operating earnings before income tax across its three primary business segments. Importantly, those earnings do not include investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized. But they do include investment income, such as dividends from stocks and interest earned on U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nBerkshire's insurance subsidiaries were the primary driver of operating earnings before income tax in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire stock trades at a tolerable valuation\n\nGoing forward, CFRA analyst Catherine Seifert expects Berkshire to grow operating earnings per share at 12% annually over the next three years. That may be conservative given that operating earnings per share increased at 23% annually over the last three years. However, even accounting for that deceleration, the current valuation of 21.7 times operating earnings is tolerable.\n\nWe can also examine valuation from another perspective. Berkshire shares currently trade at 1.5 times book value. That is a slight premium to the three-year average of 1.4 times book value, but it's not unreasonable.\n\nInvestors should not kid themselves into thinking Berkshire is cheap. But the stock kept pace with the S&P 500 over the last five years, and I think it can do the same over the next five, while offering the added benefit of outperformance during down markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Soaring Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Aren't Just Hype",
        "body": "It seems that all modern technological innovations undergo a hype cycle of sorts. The most famous is the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Nasdaq more than doubled from the beginning of 1997 through the March 2000 zenith. Many think an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble is forming now; many others disagree. One of the key differences between companies now and those during the dot-com bubble is profitability.\n\nWhile many tech companies back then had little sales and no profits, dozens of companies in the AI industry today are cash-flow positive, have soaring revenue, or are highly profitable -- not just hyped. This is a critical distinction that can help guide your investment strategy. Here are two companies that fit this mold.\n\nMicron Technology\n\nIf there is one thing that AI needs, it is data, and this data needs memory -- tons of it. Micron (NASDAQ: MU) is a global leader in providing DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND (flash memory), which are used in smartphones, PCs, memory cards, data centers, etc. After a rough fiscal 2023, Micron is back in a major way.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Micron battled geopolitical problems that hampered Chinese sales and a market where its products were not in demand due to oversupply. In other words, many of its customers were using existing inventory rather than purchasing more from Micron. Sales fell from $31 billion in fiscal 2022 to $16 billion in fiscal 2023. The industry is cyclical; in 2023, it was down, but now things are looking up.\n\nAI powers two trends that will be tailwinds for Micron. First, hundreds of data centers are coming online every year, and this trend is expected to continue for many years. Micron's management says that its HBM (high-bandwidth memory) sales will reach hundreds of millions this fiscal year and \"multiple billions\" next fiscal year. Next, AI will increase demand for upgrading PCs and smartphones, and these AI-ready systems will require more memory, a direct benefit to Micron.\n\nMicron reported $6.8 billion in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal-year 2024, an 81% increase over the prior year and a significant margin improvement due to high demand. Operating income improved year over year from a loss of $1.8 billion to a profit of $719 million.\n\nThe stock's valuation is out of whack due to its profitability last year and incremental recovery this year. This year's average analyst earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations are just $1.23, giving Micron a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over 100 at the current price; however, this isn't the whole story. As shown below, analysts predict a massive EPS jump next year to $9.48, which would make the P/E only 14.\n\nStory continues\n\nMU PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe low valuation based on fiscal 2025 estimates and significant tailwinds make Micron a solid long-term investment.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity is always a priority for executives because the costs of breaches, in terms of direct costs, downtime, recovery, etc., can be immense. Most successful breaches occur through endpoints, so companies clamor for protection from AI-powered protection like CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) Falcon platform.\n\nFalcon is entirely cloud-based and modular, so companies can add features as needed. Selling additional modules is part of CrowdStrike's land-and-expand sales strategy, which works well. As of Q1 FY25, 65% of customers used at least five modules, and 28% used seven or more.\n\nThe demand for endpoint protection drives incredible growth for CrowdStrike's sales and free cash flow, as shown below.\n\nCRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe incredible rise in sales and nearly 32% free-cash-flow margin over the last 12 months show why investors are buying the stock hand over fist. The stock is up 50% so far in 2024 and 500% over the past five years. However, the epic rise has pushed the stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio extremely high.\n\nCrowdStrike's P/S ratio now stands near 29, higher than fellow high-growth software company Palantir and cybersecurity companies like Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler:\n\nCRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nCRWD PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nInvestors should be cautious about buying CrowdStrike because of its valuation; however, the company's results are spectacular, and it has a tremendous future.\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom is in full swing, and many companies are reaping the rewards.

        "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven.\" What About the Incredible Eight?",
        "body": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" was a phrase coined by CNBC's Jim Cramer to group the most dominant stocks in the market. The seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft Apple Nvidia Alphabet Amazon Meta Platforms Tesla\n\nWhile this is a solid list, I believe it leaves out one incredibly important business. In fact, if this company didn't exist, these seven companies wouldn't look the same.\n\nSo, instead of the Magnificent Seven, I'm proposing the Incredible Eight, which adds Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) to the cohort.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's product innovation has kept it on top of its industry\n\nWith a $900 billion market cap, TSMC is actually the seventh-largest company listed on U.S. exchanges -- larger than Tesla's $585 billion.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a chip foundry, meaning companies design chips and then outsource the manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor, which has the expertise to create them. The company is the market leader in this space and has industry-leading 3 nanometer (nm) chip technology that allows it to manufacture the most powerful chips possible right now. Additionally, TSMC has a culture of continuous innovation, and the next generation of 2nm chips is slated to launch sometime in 2025.\n\nAlthough TSMC doesn't name all its clients, every member of the Magnificent Seven is either a direct or indirect customer. That's a great position to be in, and a TSMC investment gives investors a chance to benefit from all technological innovations made by the original Magnificent Seven.\n\nAnd multiple catalysts are in line to boost its business.\n\nTSMC is about to experience two significant tailwinds\n\nIn Apple's latest announcement, it launched Apple Intelligence, its take on artificial intelligence (AI). In this announcement was the kicker that only the latest generation of iPhones and newer will have access to this technology, so consumers will have to upgrade to gain access to this feature. Over the past three years, Apple essentially made up a quarter of TSMC's revenue, so if this ignites an upgrade cycle, TSMC will be a huge beneficiary.\n\nThis is a big relief, as 38% of TSMC's revenue in the first quarter came from the smartphone segment, which saw its quarter-over-quarter revenue figure drop by 16%. Given how important smartphones are to TSMC's business, it's critical that this area turns around.\n\nHowever, another division, AI, is also starting to shine. Management projects a 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next five years with AI-related hardware. After that catalyst is complete, it projects it will make up around 20% of total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's massive growth from a segment that is just emerging, and it's critical to get in before the lion's share of that growth occurs.\n\nBoth factors give credence to management's long-term goal of growing revenue at a 15% to 20% CAGR for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's rare to find a company that consistently delivers that kind of growth over the long term, but Taiwan Semiconductor is well-positioned to do it. As a result, I think it's one of the best stocks to buy now and hold for the long term.\n\nOne slight caveat to this pitch is that Taiwan Semiconductor's stock isn't the cheapest at 28 times forward earnings.\n\nTSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, considering that other Magnificent Seven members like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla trade at much higher multiples, it's still a fair price to pay.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's long-term trajectory is just too good to ignore, and every investor should consider owning some shares. Although I don't know if the Incredible Eight will become a trend, I think adding Taiwan Semiconductor to this cohort makes sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Roaring Kitty Owns $217 Million of Chewy Stock. Should You Get In Now?",
        "body": "Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, has a new favorite stock.\n\nThe man behind the GameStop meme stock phenomenon filed a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 1 showing that on June 24, he took a 6.6% stake in Chewy (NYSE: CHWY). As of the close of trading on July 3, that stake was worth about $217 million. That's a massive bet for Gill.\n\nThe combination of Gill's bullishness and his social media following has made the stock extremely volatile. Shares surged higher when Gill posted a picture of a cartoon dog on X in late June, and they moved again following the SEC disclosure. But Chewy stock has already given back most all the gains it made since Gill made his big purchase, and then some. That gives those who might be interested in following him into the stock an opportunity to get in at a similar price.\n\nShould retail investors seriously consider taking a cue from this YOLO bet by the meme stock king?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe leading online retailer for all kitties (and other pets)\n\nChewy is the biggest online retailer of pet products. Pets are common in U.S. households, and the amount people spend on them is growing rapidly. The American Pet Products Association forecasts that Americans will spend over $150 billion on their pets this year, up from $90 billion in 2018.\n\nThat puts Chewy in a favorable position. In online retail, size matters. It makes fulfilling and shipping orders more efficient, thus reducing one of e-commerce's biggest expenses. Chewy uses that advantage in two ways. First, it's able to offer competitive pricing on pet supplies and over-the-counter medicines thanks to its operating efficiency. Second, it's leveraging its existing customer base to expand into new verticals.\n\nSpecifically, Chewy has expanded its efforts in advertising and healthcare. Veterinary care and pharmaceuticals account for more than 25% of that $150 billion in pet industry spending. That's a massive market for Chewy to take a slice out of.\n\nChewy Health is just getting started. The company opened four vet care clinics this year and plans to open up to four more by year's end. A higher mix shift to healthcare products among its online sales led to strong gross margin expansion in the first quarter.\n\nLikewise, strong ad sales boosted revenue and gross margin. The company expects its advertising revenues will grow to become 1% to 3% of its total top line. While that sounds small, advertising sales can have a massive impact on the bottom line since ads command high operating margins.\n\nA loyal core customer base\n\nWhile the number of active Chewy customers has declined since the height of the pandemic, it has a growing core customer base.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomers who use its recurring autoship feature accounted for 77.6% of sales in the first quarter. That was the highest percentage the company had ever recorded.\n\nAutoship is a win-win for Chewy and its customers. Customers get small discounts on items they purchase on a regular cadence such as treats or medicine. Chewy gains more predictability about its customers' orders, can package more items together to reduce shipping costs, and experiences higher customer retention.\n\nThe company is working to increase customer loyalty with a new paid membership program, Chewy Plus, that offers unlimited free shipping, rewards, and exclusive perks. The program is currently in the testing phase.\n\nBoth autoship, its new membership program, and its growing healthcare business (with physical locations) can be great ways to foster customer loyalty, and they can all work in concert.\n\nIs Chewy stock a roaring buy?\n\nAt their recent prices, Chewy shares look like good value.\n\nThe company's enterprise value is about about 20 times its forward EBITDA estimates. And it should experience strong bottom-line growth as revenue climbs higher and margins expand thanks to its advertising and healthcare efforts. Analysts currently expect its earnings per share (EPS) will grow 178% this year and 68% next year.\n\nEPS growth was further supported by the $500 million share repurchase program management announced in conjunction with its first-quarter earnings report. It executed that share repurchase in one fell swoop last month, buying 17.55 million shares at a price of $28.49 apiece from a single entity. It still has over $500 million left in cash on its balance sheet, based on its first-quarter report, and it generates positive free cash flow every quarter.\n\nWhile a stock-buyback deal at that price doesn't look that impressive when shares trade for around $25 today, it does suggest that management felt it was a fair price for the shares. And management has better information than any outsider about the future finances of the company.\n\nWith strong growth ahead of it, Chewy is a company worth owning. Investors just need to be aware that Gill's involvement with the stock could create a lot of volatility in the share price.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "How Can I Reduce My Tax Liability on a Roth IRA Conversion?",
        "body": "Converting your current retirement accounts to a Roth IRA is typically a very tax-efficient strategy. It can help lower your lifetime taxes significantly. However it does come with a large up-front bill.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to avoid conversion taxes completely, you can restructure them to make this much more manageable. By staggering out your conversion or timing it for years in which you have low tax liability or portfolio losses, you can reduce the impact of a Roth IRA conversion.\n\nIf you need help executing a strategy to minimize your taxes, speak to a financial advisor today.\n\nConverting to a Roth IRA Triggers Income Taxes\n\nTraditional qualifying employer-sponsored retirement accounts have opposite tax treatments compared to Roth IRAs.\n\nRetirement accounts such as traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s are called \u201cpre-tax\u201d accounts. This means that while you may enjoy a tax break on your contributions going into these plans, you\u2019ll face full income taxes when you eventually make withdrawals. You effectively pay no income taxes on the money you put in but full income taxes on the money you take out.\n\nOn the other hand, Roth IRAs are called \u201cpost-tax\u201d accounts. While you cannot take a deduction for the money you contribute, you don\u2019t have to pay income taxes at all on your withdrawals. Effectively, you pay full income taxes on the money you put in but no income taxes on the money you take out.\n\nSince your portfolio gains will almost certainly exceed your contributions given enough time and the right allocations, a Roth IRA is one of the best tax-advantaged retirement accounts for most households. This is why many people like to take advantage of Roth IRA conversions \u2013 moving their money from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA to take advantage of the long-term tax savings.\n\nThere\u2019s a catch though. When you move money from an IRA into a Roth IRA, for instance, you must essentially make up for the initial deduction you took by paying income taxes on the full value of your conversion. In practice, this means that you add the value of a conversion to your taxable income for the year in which you took it. This can increase your taxes, sometimes by quite a lot depending on the size of your transfer.\n\nYou cannot avoid paying taxes on this money, however you can reduce the impact of a conversion. Here are a few strategies to consider.\n\nA financial advisor can help you weigh the pros and cons of a Roth conversion in your personal situation.\n\nStrategies to Reduce Your Conversion Taxes\n\nIf you\u2019re near retirement age, it\u2019s important to note that you cannot make penalty-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA for five years after you open the account. So, take that into consideration when deciding on a conversion strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nStagger Conversions\n\nIt may make sense to avoid converting everything all at once. Instead, you can convert a little bit at a time. By making the conversion in pieces, you may be able to keep your tax bracket lower over a series of years, rather than if you converted everything up front.\n\nThe corollary to staggered conversion is tax bracket management. When you convert your IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA, you will add the value of this conversion to your taxable income for the year. If you\u2019re not careful, this can raise your AGI enough to push you into a new tax bracket. While this won\u2019t affect your taxes on income below the cutoff, you\u2019ll pay even more in taxes on any conversion money above the new bracket.\n\nIt can be very useful to keep an eye on how a conversion will affect your taxes. Convert enough to maximize your current bracket, but not enough to push you into a higher one.\n\nIt may also be helpful to consider that the longer you take to convert your IRA, the more time your portfolio will have to grow and the more you may ultimately have to move (and pay taxes on). You also could miss out on tax-free growth in the Roth during this time.\n\nSpeak to a financial advisor to explore ways to maximize your retirement income and minimize taxes.\n\nOffset Capital Gains Losses\n\nWhen you take investment losses, you can offset investment gains down to $0. After that, you can use investment losses to offset up to $3,000 in taxable income per year, indefinitely, as well.\n\nThis can be an excellent opportunity to do a limited Roth IRA conversion. By writing down up to $3,000 in capital gains losses, you can offset some of the increased taxable income that you will see from the IRA.\n\nTime Conversions to Market Downturns\n\nSimilarly, you can also time your conversion to unrealized losses in the stock market.\n\nWhen you make a Roth IRA conversion, you increase your taxable income by the entire amount converted. As a result, you\u2019re better off moving the smallest amount of money possible. This makes market downturns an opportunity to minimize your tax liability. Time your conversion to when your IRA portfolio loses value. A 10% market downturn means that you might move 10% less cash over to your Roth IRA, reducing the impact on your taxes. However, you\u2019ll also be contributing less to the Roth than if the market was in better shape.\n\nA financial advisor can help you project your income and taxes in multiple scenarios.\n\nPay Attention to Income Triggers\n\nFinally, remember that the rules to many different programs are linked to your annual income. From student aid to Medicaid, tax credits and more, a vast number of different public and private entities base your eligibility on this or last year\u2019s taxable income.\n\nFor the self employed, this is particularly essential. Your real, estimated and self-employment taxes are all based on your AGI, so a change in your taxed income can change several different areas of taxation.\n\nMake sure to look at any program or grant that you depend on before making a conversion, and structure your conversion to keep your income below any applicable caps. You don\u2019t want to roll your portfolio over just to discover that doing so made you ineligible for tuition assistance.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA Roth IRA conversion is a very good long-term plan for most households, but it comes with a large tax bill attached. You cannot avoid paying those taxes, but you can structure your conversion to minimize its impact.\n\nRoth IRA Planning Tips\n\nTax advantages are all well and good, but a Roth IRA is really only valuable if it delivers growth. Otherwise, you\u2019re saving taxes on money that never actually happened. So\u2026 what kind of return can you expect from a Roth IRA?\n\nA financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Xesai, \u00a9iStock.com/uchar, \u00a9iStock.com/Anna Frank\n\nThe post How to Reduce Your Tax Liability on a Roth IRA Conversion appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset.",

        "title": "2 Reasons to Buy Marvell Technology Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "body": "Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) could see demand for its semiconductor solutions explode over the next few years. Marvell's products are used in a wide range of goods, from game consoles and printers to enterprise workstations and artificial intelligence (AI) servers. But data center, including AI-related products, is its largest business, totaling 40% of its revenue last year.\n\nThe growth in AI infrastructure spending could significantly benefit Marvell's revenue growth and stock performance over the next year.\n\nThe risk for investors is buying the stock before a cyclical downswing in demand, which is common for the semiconductor industry. However, the industry has experienced a lot of growth over the last 40 years, so buying shares of leading companies as they emerge from a downswing can be to your advantage.\n\nHere are two reasons Marvell stock is a buy right now.\n\n1. Marvell is well positioned for growing AI demand\n\nMarvell reported a year-over-year decline of 12% in revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 to $1.16 billion, but it is just starting to see a recovery after a weak year for demand across some of its business segments. The revenue decline was driven by weakness in enterprise networking, industrial, and consumer products. Management expects these markets to bottom in the second half of the year.\n\nThe reason to buy the stock now is the growth in Marvell's data center business, where revenue nearly doubled over the year-ago quarter to $876 million. Marvell is meeting a crucial need for AI-optimized data centers. It provides interconnects and other data transfer products that allow clusters of high-performance computing systems to communicate through high-speed connections -- a must-have for AI workloads.\n\nMarvell believes it has plenty of opportunities to expand its addressable market across AI compute programs, interconnect switching, and storage solutions. Management previously guided for AI-related revenue to reach $1.5 billion this year, or nearly 30% of its total revenue, before growing to $2.5 billion next year.\n\nOverall, Marvell sees the data center infrastructure addressable market tripling to $75 billion by 2028. This tailwind could fuel outstanding returns for shareholders.\n\n2. The stock is reasonably priced relative to growth expectations\n\nComing out of the recent downturn for the semiconductor industry, Wall Street is becoming increasingly bullish on Marvell's prospects. The average analyst expects the company's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 34% over the long term. This is up from a low-double-digit estimate a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nHistorically, the best time to buy shares of Marvell or other semiconductor stocks is when the industry is turning the corner after a rough year. Now appears to be an ideal time to jump on board. Despite higher growth expectations, the stock is up 18% over the last 12 months but is still trading 24% below its previous peak.\n\nThe stock's recent advance has brought its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to a more expensive 50 multiple. However, the company should be able to grow into the stock's high valuation. For example, when considering next year's earnings estimate, the stock's forward P/E drops to a more reasonable 28.\n\nOnce Marvell's non-data center markets recover, such as enterprise networking and consumer products, the stock could be off to the races. With management anticipating a recovery in all of its end markets in the second half of the fiscal year, the stock looks like a great buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Marvell Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Marvell Technology wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "body": "In the past 20 years, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 619% (as of July 2). This means that a $10,000 investment would've turned into $72,000 today. That's a great return.\n\nBut there's one stock that has drastically outperformed the broader index. The business I'm talking about has nothing to do with the internet or artificial intelligence, which is a shocker.\n\nThis magnificent stock has generated a fantastic 4,440% return in the past two decades. That $10,000 initial investment would be worth a jaw-dropping $454,000 today. Continue reading to learn more about this successful company.\n\nBoring is beautiful\n\nInvestors need to get familiar with O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY). This is a boring aftermarket auto-parts retailer, with 6,131 stores scattered across the U.S. (with a small presence in Canada and Mexico) that has put up exciting returns for its investors over the years. There are a few reasons why this is a wonderful business.\n\nFor starters, O'Reilly faces minimal threats to disruption. It targets consumers whose cars are past their original manufacturer's warranty, which is a massive pool of vehicles nationwide. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) might be a risk to be mindful of, but there's a long way from now to a time when these cars will be dominating our roads. For the time being, O'Reilly should continue benefiting from the growing age of vehicles and the increasing number of miles driven each year.\n\nThe company's financials are superb. Growth has been steady. Revenue of $15.8 billion in 2023 was 66% higher than five years earlier. Perhaps more impressive, O'Reilly reported strong above-normal, double-digit, same-store sales growth throughout the depths of the pandemic.\n\nGenerating profits seems effortless. In the last decade, O'Reilly's operating margin has averaged 19.8%. Given the non-discretionary nature of some of the products the company sells, there could be some pricing power that management takes advantage of from time to time.\n\nThere are few businesses that help their shareholders sleep well at night more so than O'Reilly. That's because it experiences durable demand regardless of the macroclimate.\n\nIn recessionary periods, consumers might hold off buying a new car. Instead, they'll invest in the parts and supplies to keep their existing vehicles running and in good condition.\n\nAnd during a robust economic backdrop, with low unemployment and heightened consumer confidence, people will likely drive more. This increases the wear and tear on their cars. In both of these scenarios, demand for O'Reilly is healthy. This is what has been the case historically.\n\nStory continues\n\nLook at the valuation\n\nAs of this writing, shares of O'Reilly trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.3. This doesn't scream bargain. It's more expensive than the S&P 500's P/E multiple of 24.1. And it represents an 11% premium to the stock's trailing-10-year average. I don't think O'Reilly is a secret. The market is fully aware of just how outstanding a business this is.\n\nHowever, it might still be smart to buy the stock. According to Wall Street consensus-analyst estimates, revenue and earnings per share (EPS) are expected to rise at compound annual rates of 6.3% and 10.9%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026. While it's always a good idea to take forecasts with a grain of salt due to the predictable nature of this business, these estimates could be reasonable. Seeing the bottom line grow double digits would be great.\n\nPast results don't guarantee future returns, but O'Reilly is a proven compounding machine that has provided superior returns for patient shareholders. You could argue that the shares are fully valued right now, but the price could be worth it to own a proven winner with minimal risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in O'Reilly Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in O'Reilly Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and O'Reilly Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "S&P 500 investors vs. actively managed funds: 2024 is an even better year for buying and holding the index",
        "body": "In the running debate between actively managed funds versus simply investing in a fund that tracks the S&P 500, the scorecard continues to tilt toward the broad stock market index.\n\nAccording to data from Morningstar Direct, just 18.2% of actively managed funds whose primary prospectus benchmark is the S&P 500 managed to outperform the index in the first half of this year.\n\nThat's on track to be worse than last year, when only 19.8% of actively managed funds beat the S&P 500.\n\nOf course, some years are better for fund managers than others. In 2022, when the Federal Reserve launched its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades and sent the S&P 500 tumbling, 63.3% of active funds outperformed. In 2014, only 14.2% did.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the average share of active funds that beat the S&P 500 was 27%, setting up 2024 to be an especially weak year.\n\nData from Morningstar Direct also shows that 13.4% of passively managed funds are outperforming so far this year. And over the past decade, passive funds consistently trailed active funds in the share that beat the S&P 500.\n\nBut that's not surprising given that many passive funds are only looking to keep pace with the index and maintain lower expenses rather than charge higher fees and hope that they get bigger returns.\n\nTo be sure, the vast majority of the S&P 500's recent gains have come from just a handful of tech giants. That leaves index investors vulnerable to a selloff in one stock like Nvidia. Still, even as Nvidia has come well off its highs over the past few weeks, the index has continued to hit fresh records as other stocks climbed.\n\nMeanwhile, separate data showed that the S&P 500 beat three out of every four exchange-traded funds in the past year, the worst showing for ETFs since at least 2010.\n\nIn addition, funds that are diversified across asset classes and geographies also fared worse than the S&P 500. Such portfolios have lagged the index in 13 of the last 15 years, according to data from Cambria Funds cited by Bloomberg. Other data showed that out of 370 asset-allocation funds tracked by Morningstar, just one has beaten the index since 2009.\n\n\u201cIn a low-volatility, high-return environment like 2024, investors should stick to the basics \u2014 buying uncomplicated index funds, and active mutual funds with a proven track record of delivering alpha,\u201d Evercore strategist Julian Emanuel told Bloomberg last month. \u201cNo need to complicate strategy. In simplicity there is beauty.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Better Chip Stock: AMD vs. Micron",
        "body": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU) are both underdogs in their respective markets. AMD is the world's second-largest maker of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs after Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), respectively. Micron is the world's third-largest producer of DRAM chips and its fourth-largest supplier of NAND chips. Samsung and SK Hynix lead both the DRAM and NAND markets.\n\nYet AMD and Micron both have unique competitive advantages.\n\nAMD, by outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, sells denser, cheaper, and more power-efficient CPUs than Intel. It also sells cheaper GPUs than Nvidia. Micron, which operates its own foundries, produces denser memory chips than its South Korean competitors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThose strengths enabled both chipmakers to weather tough macro, cyclical, and competitive headwinds. Over the past 10 years, AMD's stock price soared 3,770% as it gained ground against Intel in x86 CPUs, kept pace with Nvidia in discrete GPUs, and carved out a defensible niche with its custom APUs for gaming consoles.\n\nMicron's stock rallied more than 300% as the expansion of the mobile, data center, PC, and connected vehicle markets generated cyclical but steady demand for its DRAM and NAND chips. AMD has clearly been the more exciting play for growth-oriented investors, but is it still the better buy right now? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.\n\nBoth companies face cyclical headwinds\n\nIn 2023, AMD generated 29% of its revenue from its sales of Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs for data centers. It generated another 27% of its sales from gaming GPUs for PCs and custom APUs for consoles, 23% from its sales of embedded chips (including Xilinx's programmable chips), and the remaining 21% from x86 CPUs for PCs.\n\nAMD's revenue fell 4% for the year as its declining sales of PC and gaming chips offset its stronger sales of data center and embedded chips for the growing AI market. Its sales of PC CPUs and GPUs declined as fewer people upgraded their PCs following the industry's temporary growth spurt during the pandemic, and its sales of custom APUs slipped as Sony and Microsoft sold fewer consoles. Inflationary headwinds for consumer spending exacerbated that slowdown.\n\nAs a result, AMD's adjusted gross margin shrank two percentage points to 50% in 2023 as its adjusted earnings plunged 24%. But for 2024, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 5% and 23%, respectively, as it ships more data center chips for the booming AI market and the PC and gaming markets stabilize. For 2025, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase 28% and 60%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last August), Micron's revenue plummeted 49%, its adjusted gross margin turned negative, and it posted an adjusted net loss. Its sales of DRAM chips (71% of its top line) and NAND chips (27%) shriveled as PC shipments fizzled out and the 5G upgrade cycle for smartphones ended. The macro headwinds also drove its data customers to prioritize AI-oriented purchases of GPUs over new memory chips.\n\nBut in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Micron's revenue surged 51% year over year as the PC and smartphone markets stabilized, and data centers upgraded their solid-state drives (SSDs) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to process more AI tasks. Its adjusted gross margin and adjusted earnings also turned positive again.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect Micron's revenue to grow 50% with an adjusted profit. For fiscal 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase by 54% and 676%, respectively, as a new growth cycle begins.\n\nBut one stock seems to be the better value\n\nAMD and Micron should both experience accelerating growth over the next two years as their core markets warm up again. However, AMD looks a bit pricey at 48 times forward earnings -- especially when Nvidia, which is growing faster with more exposure to the AI market -- has a forward multiple of 49. Micron trades at just 16 times forward earnings.\n\nAMD's valuations seem to be inflated by the market's high expectations for its Instinct GPUs -- which cost much less than Nvidia's H100 GPUs -- for the AI-driven data center market. But AMD only generates a sliver of its revenue from those chips and is highly exposed to the wobblier PC and gaming console markets.\n\nInvestors also seem bullish on Micron's growth potential in the AI market -- but its cyclical recovery is clearer and it looks more reasonably valued. That's why I believe the memory chipmaker is a better buy than AMD right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Ask An Advisor: I'm a 43-Year-Old Divorced Dad With $315K in an IRA, $90K in a Roth and Other Accounts. I Max Out My 401(k) Each Year. Can I Retire at 57?\n\nI am a 43-year-old divorced father. I have $315,000 in a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), $90,000 in a Roth IRA, $22,000 in a health savings account (HSA), $8,000 in a 529 college savings account, $30,000 in a traditional 401k, $25,000 in U.S i-bonds, $40,000 invested in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and $20,000 in cash. I max out my employer\u2019s 401(k) and family HSA each year. At age 57, I\u2019d like to stop most of my full-time employment and start rolling over money from my traditional IRA into my Roth IRA, up to the standard deduction each year. I would try to live on nontaxable income during that time until at least age 62. I would then like to keep that up by living on my Roth accounts until age 67, at which point I would take Social Security, which would be around $3,500 per month and is pretty close to my actual monthly expenses. Am I overdoing it?\n\n-Jacob\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to commend you on both the savings you\u2019ve already accumulated and the amount of thought you\u2019ve put into this plan. All of that work has put you in a fantastic position to be able to retire on your own terms.\n\nSo, are you on track to retire at age 57? And are you overdoing it? Let\u2019s take a look. (And if you\u2019re looking for help with your own financial question, this tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nBack-of-the-Envelope Math\n\nAsk An Advisor: I'm a 43-Year-Old Divorced Dad With $315K in an IRA, $90K in a Roth and Other Accounts. I Max Out My 401(k) Each Year. Can I Retire at 57?\n\nFor a quick look at your investing and savings situation, you can use the 4% rule and make some assumptions about your investment returns in order to see if you\u2019re on the right track.\n\nThe 4% rule says that when you retire, you can withdraw 4% of your total retirement savings each year, adjusting for inflation, with minimal risk of running out of money. You might not want to bet your entire financial plan on this rule, but there\u2019s plenty of research behind it. Using the 4% rule is a good way to see if you\u2019re on the right track.\n\nIf you start at age 43 with $522,000 in retirement savings (I\u2019m excluding your cash and 529 savings account since those are for other purposes), and assume a 4% annual inflation-adjusted rate of return with $29,700 in annual contributions, you reach age 57 with $1,468,936 across your various investment accounts.\n\nApplying the 4% rule to that $1,468,936 balance, you would be able to withdraw $58,757 per year, which sounds like it should be enough to cover your expenses.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a simplified calculation that doesn\u2019t factor in Social Security or taxes, so let\u2019s dig a little deeper. (Looking for help with a financial question? This tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing SmartAsset\u2019s Retirement Calculator\n\nFor a more robust look, I used SmartAsset\u2019s retirement calculator and entered all of the details you provided in your question. I estimated your annual expenses at $60,000.\n\nAccording to that calculator, you would need $1,342,034 in order to retire at age 57 and you are on track to have $1,516,049. So again, it\u2019s looking like you\u2019re on the right track to meet your goals. (Looking for help with a financial question? This tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nAsk An Advisor: I'm a 43-Year-Old Divorced Dad With $315K in an IRA, $90K in a Roth and Other Accounts. I Max Out My 401(k) Each Year. Can I Retire at 57?\n\nWhile all of the above indicates that you are in very good shape, there are certain variables that we haven\u2019t accounted for above.\n\nOne big variable is the cost of college. There is a wide range of possibilities there, all the way from paying nothing to spending $70,000 or more per year for a private university. And while you do have some dedicated college savings, a big college expense could force you to dip into retirement savings, which could require you to either work longer or reduce your retirement spending.\n\nThere are also plenty of things about your situation that could change over the years, from your job to your health to the investment returns you receive to your personal goals. No financial plan, no matter how good, is ever a finished product and it is important to regularly reevaluate to make sure you\u2019re still on track.\n\nWhen it comes to your plan for withdrawals, especially in the early years of retirement, I would also be careful about making minimizing taxes too high of a priority. (Looking for help with a financial question? This tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nYou certainly don\u2019t want to pay more than you have to, and being tax-conscious in your approach is the right idea. But it may be smart to have some taxable income in those earlier years to fill up those lower tax brackets, which might allow you to avoid higher tax brackets down the line and actually pay fewer taxes over the long term.\n\nI would also consider the possibility that living off cash and bonds during your first few years of retirement could cause your overall asset allocation to be more conservative than it needs to be for your goals and risk tolerance. It can certainly make sense to keep ample cash reserves so that you\u2019re not as susceptible to short-term market movements. But being too conservative could sacrifice long-term growth and security. And remember that paying taxes just means your money has grown, which is a good thing.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also important to acknowledge that there are many details about your situation that I don\u2019t know, so I\u2019m certainly not in any position to give you specific advice on withdrawal and tax strategies. These are just things to consider as you continue to fine-tune your plan.\n\nNext Steps\n\nYou seem to be right on track for your major goals with some wiggle room to weather the unexpected, which is right where you want to be. As long as you continue to review your goals, save and make adjustments along the way, you should be in good shape.\n\nInvesting and Retirement Planning Tips\n\nIf you have questions specific to your investing and retirement situation, a financial advisor can help. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nAs you plan for retirement, keep an eye on Social Security. Use SmartAsset\u2019s Social Security calculator to get an idea of what your benefits could look like in retirement.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nMatt Becker, CFP\u00ae, is a SmartAsset financial planning columnist and answers reader questions on personal finance and tax topics.

        "title": "3 High-Yield Dividend ETFs to Buy to Generate Passive Income",
        "body": "Passive often isn't viewed as a positive quality. When used to describe an individual, it implies the person sits back and lets things happen to them -- frequently bad things.\n\nBut passive income is a different story altogether. An investor with great sources of passive income sits back and lets good things happen, namely allowing money to flow in regularly.\n\nWhat are some great sources of passive income? I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a smart place to look. Here are three high-yield dividend ETFs to buy to generate passive income (listed alphabetically).\n\n1. Investco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF\n\nThe Invesco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEMKT: XSHD) managed by Invesco pays a sky-high 30-day SEC yield of 7.72%. This yield, by the way, reflects the net investment income per share less expenses over the previous 30 days divided by the current maximum offering price. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) developed it as a way for investors to compare funds.\n\nAs the ETF's name hints, it focuses on small-cap stocks with high dividend yields but relatively low volatility over the past 12 months. The Invesco ETF owns 57 stocks. Its top holdings include Highwoods Properties, Organon, Armour Residential REIT, Two Harbors Investment Corp, and Ellington Financial.\n\nIncome investors will probably like that the Investco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF pays distributions monthly. They might also like the fund's manageable annual expense ratio of 0.3%.\n\nWhat's not to like? Despite generating great income, the fund hasn't performed very well historically. Since its inception in December 2016, this Investco ETF's average annual return is -1.17%.\n\n2. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF\n\nThe JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI) managed by JPMorgan Chase isn't too far behind the Invest ETF in generating passive income. This fund's 30-day SEC yield stood at 7.55% as of May 31, 2024.\n\nThis ETF uses a proprietary process to select stocks with less volatility that may or may not pay dividends. It sells out-of-the-money S&P 500 index call options to generate income. Like the Investco ETF, the JPMorgan ETF makes monthly distributions.\n\nThe JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF currently owns 133 stocks. Its top holdings include Microsoft), Amazon, Progressive, Meta Platforms, and Trane Technologies.\n\nThis ETF has an annual expense ratio of 0.35%. Its performance has been strong with an average annual return of 12.57% since its inception in May 2020. Arguably the main knock against the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF is that it hasn't been around very long.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF\n\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD) is managed by State Street. It offers a 30-day SEC yield of 4.68%.\n\nIts name gives away the ETF's focus. The SPDR ETF invests in stocks in the S&P 500 index with high dividend yields. The fund owns 75 stocks with top holdings including Iron Mountain, Public Service Enterprise Group, Williams Companies, International Paper, and Hasbro.\n\nOne big plus for this ETF is its low cost. The fund's annual expense ratio is only 0.07%. The SPDR ETF has also performed relatively well historically with an average annual return of nearly 8.6% since its inception in October 2015.\n\nUnlike the Invesco and JPMorgan ETFs, the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF pays distributions quarterly instead of monthly. However, the combination of the fund's juicy yield, low cost, and track record of positive returns could make it a good pick for investors seeking passive income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell is likely to tell lawmakers that Federal Reserve officials need further confirmation inflation is slowing before they\u2019re in a position to cut interest rates, even with evidence building of softer growth and employment.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJune consumer price index data are projected to be another step toward that goal, but the figures are only set for release on Thursday \u2014 after the Fed chair wraps up two days of Congressional testimony. Powell speaks Tuesday to the Senate Banking Committee, followed by a House panel appearance on Wednesday.\n\nWith fresh data showing the highest unemployment rate since late 2021, and other figures illustrating weaker economic growth, Powell will likely be pressed harder by some lawmakers on why the Fed is hesitant to lower borrowing costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Powell said recent data suggest inflation is getting back on a downward path, but that he and his colleagues would like to see that progress continue.\n\nThe so-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs and is seen as a better measure of underlying inflation, is expected to rise 0.2% in June for a second month. That would mark the smallest back-to-back gains since August, a pace more palatable for Fed officials.\n\nThe inflation report is also forecast to show a modest 0.1% increase in the overall CPI from a month earlier. Compared with June of last year, the price metric is projected to rise 3.1%, the smallest annual advance in five months.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for the US\n\nMeanwhile, Friday\u2019s monthly payrolls report showed that the jobless rate, while still historically low at 4.1%, is creeping higher. Minutes from the Fed\u2019s June policy meeting revealed that several officials flagged the risk that a further slowing in demand could lead to higher unemployment.\n\nEconomists on Friday will parse the government\u2019s report on producer prices to assess the impact of certain categories \u2014 like portfolio management and health care \u2014 that feed into the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n\u201cWe expect that soft inflation prints for June, July and August will give the Fed enough confidence to start cutting rates by the time of the September FOMC meeting.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2014Estelle Ou, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Chris G. Collins, and Anna Wong, economists. For full analysis, click here\n\nFurther north it\u2019s a light data week, but June home sales on Friday will shed light on whether the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate cut that month jolted the market out of a slumber.\n\nElsewhere, inflation numbers from China to Sweden and the aftermath of France\u2019s parliamentary election runoff will be among highlights.\n\nClick here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what\u2019s coming up in the global economy.\n\nAsia\n\nChina may get some mildly positive news on prices, with data Wednesday expected to show consumer inflation ticked higher in June and factory-gate deflation eased to the slowest pace since January 2023. Whether that helps buoy manufacturing remains to be seen.\n\nIn other data, Japanese figures for workers\u2019 pay on Monday may show real wages sliding for a 26th month in May, casting doubts on the prospects of achieving the virtuous cycle long sought by the Bank of Japan.\n\nConsumer price growth in India may have nudged higher in June, and Australia unveils consumer inflation expectations on Thursday.\n\nTrade statistics are due from China, the Philippines and Taiwan, while Singapore is set to release second-quarter gross domestic product data during the week.\n\nOn the policy front, a couple of regional central banks are expected to stand pat, with investors looking ahead to prospects for rate cuts in the second half.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets after a weak reading for the composite purchasing managers index pointed to slackening economic growth, possibly opening the door to a cut in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bank of Korea gathers a week after inflation slowed more than expected, boosting the prospects for pivoting to a reduction in borrowing costs as early as August, according to Bloomberg Economics.\n\nOn Friday, Kazakhstan\u2019s central bank will decide whether to follow its rate cut in May with another.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for Asia\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\n\nA focus for investors on Monday will be the aftermath of the French election. While financial-market concerns have eased, the prospect of a hung parliament leading to a minority government that lacks resolve to repair the public finances remains a likely outcome.\n\nIn the UK, whose own election led to a landslide victory for Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party, investors will be on the lookout for any initial decisions impacting the economy and its own strained fiscal position. Data on Thursday, meanwhile, may show a pickup in growth in May after stagnation the previous month.\n\nEuropean Central Bank policymakers have until the close of play on Wednesday to speak publicly about the upcoming July 18 rate decision before a blackout period kicks in. Amid a sparse calendar, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel and Executive Board member Piero Cipollone are scheduled to make appearances.\n\nIt\u2019s also a quiet week for data in the euro region. German exports on Monday and Italian industrial production numbers on Wednesday are among the highlights.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for EMEA\n\nThere\u2019s more on the calendar outside the single currency area, with several June inflation releases scheduled.\n\nHungary on Tuesday, then Norway and the Czech Republic on Wednesday, are all tipped to reveal slowing consumer price growth, albeit still with noticeable margins above 2%.\n\nThe same day, Russian data may show inflation reached a new 2024 high, underlining the challenge for the central bank. After holding its key rate at 16% so far this year, the Bank of Russia will most likely consider a hike of 100 to 200 basis points at its July meeting, Deputy Governor Alexey Zabotkin said recently.\n\nIn Egypt on Wednesday, officials will hope inflation slowed for a fourth straight month from its peak of 36% in February, which was just before the central bank raised rates as part of a huge bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the UAE, and others.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Ghana\u2019s inflation is forecast to slow for a third straight month - from 23% in May - on favorable base effects. The central bank will still be concerned by a monthly increase in prices that\u2019s expected to quicken because of a slump in the cedi.\n\nAnd on Friday in Sweden, the CPIF gauge of inflation that the Riksbank targets is expected to drop below 2% for the first time in almost three years.\n\nTwo central bank decisions of note are due within the wider region:\n\nIsrael\u2019s monetary policy committee on Monday will likely look past growing inflation pressures and keep the key rate at 4.5% for a fourth straight meeting to aid an economy strained by the war in Gaza and escalating tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nOn Thursday, Serbia\u2019s central bank makes its monthly decision, where officials may give clues on their next step for the key rate after June\u2019s rate cut, the first in more than three years.\n\nLatin America\n\nData out on Monday may show consumer prices in Chile accelerated for a third month to push further above target \u2014 while more than a year of steady disinflation appears to have stalled in Colombia.\n\nIn Mexico, inflation likely pushed higher for a fourth straight month, in no way the \u201cbenign CPI data\u201d central bank Deputy Governor Jonathan Heath says the board wants to see before easing again.\n\nBanxico, which next meets in August and has paused at 11% for the last two meetings, posts the minutes of its June 27 decision on Thursday.\n\nInflation is heating up in Brazil, along with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\u2019s temper. Brazil\u2019s leader is fuming over \u201cexaggerated\u201d double-digit interest rates and the central bank\u2019s \u201cnominated by Bolsonaro\u201d president, Roberto Campos Neto. Lula\u2019s verbal broadsides make it harder to control inflation, Campos Neto told Brazil\u2019s Valor newspaper.\n\nA string of single-digit monthly readings in Argentina has the annual inflation rate finally slowing after hitting 289.4% in April. Analysts surveyed by the central bank expect the monthly print on Friday to come in over May\u2019s 4.2% reading.\n\nPeru\u2019s central bank meets Thursday after keeping its key rate at 5.75%. A pick-up in the June headline and core inflation prints may sideline the bank for a second meeting.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for Latin America\n\n--With assistance from Robert Jameson, Laura Dhillon Kane, Tony Halpin, Monique Vanek, Brian Fowler, Paul Wallace and Zoe Schneeweiss.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks Under $20 per Share",
        "body": "A low stock price isn't always bad -- it's like a clearance sale at your favorite store.\n\nJust because a stock is cheap doesn't mean it's a dud. Sometimes, the company had a rough quarter, or maybe there's a market panic unrelated to its performance. In some cases, the long-term opportunities in front of a small company aren't recognized by Wall Street. For savvy investors, a low stock price can be a chance to buy a solid company at a discount.\n\nSo, while others run away, you could score a great deal. Remember, it's about buying low and selling high, not following the crowd. On that note, here are two top tech stocks with really low share prices.\n\nBoth stocks are, in fact, strong plays on the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Grabbing a few of these cheap shares today should serve you well in the long haul -- and the stubs are really affordable.\n\nSoundHound AI: $3.93 per share\n\nAI-powered voice control expert SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has had its ups and downs recently, but the company's long-term potential remains promising. Specializing in voice AI and conversational intelligence technologies, this little company is positioned to thrive as demand grows for these services.\n\nThere's a lot to be optimistic about here. The company has a significant backlog of long-term contracts worth $682 million, which provides a clear path to future revenue. If you overlook this crucial metric, SoundHound AI looks quite expensive in light of just $50.8 million in trailing sales. That would be a mistake in the long run.\n\nAdditionally, strategic moves such as paying off its long-term debt and acquiring key assets from the online ordering platform Allset demonstrate SoundHound AI's commitment to growth and innovation. And don't forget that the backlog is growing by leaps and bounds. The first-quarter figure stood 80% above the year-ago period's reading. In other words, SoundHound AI has set up a robust and growing portfolio of long-term contracts that will convert into real revenue streams over the next few years.\n\nWith a solid cash reserve of $180 million and no debt, SoundHound AI is well prepared to seize new opportunities. The company is not yet profitable and its valuation ratios may seem high, but that enormous (and soaring) order backlog and a string of strategic initiatives suggest a bright future. At just $3.93 per share, SoundHound AI offers a compelling investment opportunity if you're willing to take a chance on this innovative AI player.\n\nUiPath: $12.96 per share\n\nRobotic process automation (RPA) specialist UiPath (NYSE: PATH) has had a tough year, with its stock down 48% in 2024. Despite this negative Wall Street sentiment, the company remains a key player in RPA, integrating AI technologies into its service offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nRPA is software technology that automates repetitive and routine tasks usually performed by humans, improving efficiency and accuracy. Despite the name, it rarely involves actual robots. While not strictly an AI company, UiPath uses AI to boost its software capabilities, such as mining data and understanding legal documents.\n\nThe recent plunge in UiPath's stock price largely stemmed from a mixed first-quarter earnings report. While earnings and revenue came in above the consensus analyst targets, the company's annualized renewal run rate (ARR) hit the low end of its guidance at $1.51 billion. Moreover, UiPath slashed its full-year ARR forecast from $1.73 billion to $1.66 billion. That's a bad reading on the automation expert's contracts-based recurring revenue flows.\n\nThe unexpected resignation of CEO Rob Enslin, who was replaced by co-founder Daniel Dines, further unsettled investors, leading to a 34% single-day drop in the stock price. C-suite shake-ups are rarely good news, though I don't mind a company founder getting his hands back on the steering wheel.\n\nHowever, the sell-off looks overdone. UiPath's long-term prospects remain strong, with the global RPA market expected to grow from $3 billion in 2023 to $31 billion by 2030. UiPath is well positioned to capture a significant share of this expanding market, starting from just $1.35 billion in trailing revenue. As you can tell from UiPath's 45% share of the RPA market's current revenue opportunity, I'm talking about an established leader in this booming industry.\n\nUiPath's fundamentals are sound. The company boasts a robust cash reserve of $1.9 billion with no debt, allowing management to make strategic investments or acquisitions to accelerate top-line growth. Additionally, its free cash flow jumped 39% year over year to $101.3 million in Q1 2024. UiPath is making cash profits by the digital truckload.\n\nGiven the current low valuation and the significant market opportunity, UiPath presents a compelling investment opportunity. For investors willing to absorb some volatility at first, the potential for long-term gains makes UiPath a tech stock worth considering today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Is Now the Best-Performing Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average In 2024. Is It a Buy Around Its All-Time High?",
        "body": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in late February -- giving the traditionally stodgy, income-oriented index more exposure to growth.\n\nAmazon has continued its torrid run since 2023. As of June 27, it is the best-performing stock in the index.\n\nHere's why Amazon continues to climb higher and whether the growth stock is worth buying around its all-time high.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is gushing cash\n\nBefore changing its name to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), Google was named after its flagship search engine. But YouTube is arguably Alphabet's crown jewel. Facebook was named after its flagship social media app, but then changed its name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Instagram is arguably more valuable than Facebook today. Similarly, Amazon is named after its only retail outlet, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is where much of the value lies.\n\nAWS is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure. According to HG Insights 2023 Infrastructure as a Service Market Report, AWS had a 50.1% market share among the top 10 cloud providers and the highest year-over-year customer count growth at 31%. AWS has been tapping into start-ups, with 86% of AWS customers spending less than $1,000 a month on AWS services -- according to HG Insights.\n\nThe impact of AWS on the broader business is undeniable. Here's a look at Amazon's trailing-12-month (TTM) results as of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods over the last five years.\n\nMetric Q1 2020 TTM Q1 2021 TTM Q1 2022 TTM Q1 2023 TTM Q1 2024 TTM North America revenue $181.09 billion $254.52 billion $284.71 billion $323.52 billion $362.29 billion North America operating income $6.06 billion $10.79 billion $2.25 billion ($381 million) $18.96 billion International revenue $77.64 billion $115.96 billion $125.9 billion $118.37 billion $134.01 billion International operating income ($2 billion) $2.37 billion ($3.46 billion) ($7.71 billion) $903 million AWS revenue $37.55 billion $48.65 billion $67.14 billion $83 billion $94.44 billion AWS operating income $10.05 billion $14.62 billion $20.89 billion $21.45 billion $28.93 billion\n\nData source: Amazon.\n\nNotice the inconsistent operating income from Amazon's North America and international segments, as well as the somewhat sluggish top-line growth. Meanwhile, AWS has been a juggernaut, with TTM operating income increasing nearly threefold in just five years.\n\nThe most impressive metric in this table is that AWS operating income has grown faster than AWS revenue, suggesting that margins are improving. Not long ago, one of the biggest red flags for Amazon's investment thesis was that AWS couldn't keep up its margins in the face of mounting competition. But the results tell a different story and are likely a reason why the stock has been crushing the market as of late.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMZN Chart\n\nA higher-quality business\n\nAmazon is notorious for reinvesting profits back into the company. So using net income-based metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio can be unhelpful. Traditionally, Amazon's go-to metric was its price-to-sales ratio, which is the value of a company compared to its revenue. In the following chart, you'll notice that Amazon's P/S ratio is higher than historical levels -- suggesting the stock is more expensive.\n\nAMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe P/S ratio can be useful when dealing with a consistent business over a period of time. But the issue with using it to evaluate Amazon is that the company is fundamentally different today than it was even two to three years ago because of the growth of AWS. That's why I think the best way to value Amazon is by looking at its P/S ratio within the context of its operating income and operating margin.\n\nAMZN Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nThis chart is perhaps the simplest way to visualize Amazon's success. Amazon's TTM operating income is nearly $100 billion, and its operating margin is at a 10-year high thanks to AWS and a rebound in its North America and international segments.\n\nPaying a 3.53 P/S ratio for a high-growth, low-margin business is one thing. But that same ratio for a company growing its top line and expanding margins is entirely different.\n\nThe biggest bull case for Amazon is that it is within striking distance of its historical P/S ratio, but the quality of the business is vastly improved, and it is on a path toward consistent profitability. After all, analyst consensus estimates call for $4.55 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.78 in 2025 EPS -- giving Amazon a 34.1 P/E based on 2025 estimated earnings. That's not a sky-high valuation -- especially when considering the stock is up 130% in 18 months.\n\nAmazon is stretched thin but is still a good buy\n\nAmazon is at the top of its game, but its stock chart reflects that. Warren Buffett once said, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" In other words, consensus positivity toward a company usually results in an expensive stock price, just as an out-of-favor stock can be quite cheap.\n\nLess than two years ago, Amazon was under immense pressure due to slowing growth and recession fears. It was the opposite of a cheery consensus. Today, Amazon is, once again, a darling. But the long-term investment thesis has also gotten stronger as AWS continues to be a high-margin growth engine that can fuel the company's other exploits.\n\nAll told, Amazon is a decent buy, but it is no longer the no-brainer buy it was before. It still must grow into its valuation and prove its higher margins aren't a one-off. If growth slows, expect Amazon to be under pressure.\n\nThe higher a stock runs up in the short term, the more its valuation gets stretched. But over the long term, Amazon certainly has the trajectory needed to compound earnings and benefit patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Rachel Reeves: Who is the UK's new chancellor?\n\n2 days ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nReuters\n\n\"Serious\" and \"determined\" are words often used to describe Rachel Reeves, the former Bank of England economist who has become the UK's first female chancellor. But colleagues and friends have suggested that her public persona does not reflect her human side, with a loud laugh and deep love of Beyonc\u00e9 tracks. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2010, she vowed to fight for \"jobs, growth and prosperity\" - all of which form the central pillar of Labour's economic plans as it enters government. So who exactly is Rachel Reeves, and how might she address the challenges ahead?\n\nReeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just a few months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change. Her parents were both teachers and have described her as an adventurous child who might venture to the edge of a path when on a walk near the seaside. She previously told the BBC that her mum would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: \"We weren't poor, but we didn't have money to waste.\" Her parents separated when she was at primary school and she and her sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes. During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering. They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all of her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money. Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201cprudence\u201d in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.\n\nChess champion\n\nReeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. By the time she was in secondary school, she was a national champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie. A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive school, and would go on to gain four A-levels. Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 17, Reeves joined the Labour Party. She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student Reeves would host others before college discos, blasting Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.\n\nRachel Reeves: The basics\n\nAge: 45 Place of birth: Lewisham, south-east London Education: New College, Oxford and the London School of Economics Family: Married to Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant and former speechwriter to Gordon Brown during his time as chancellor. They have two children. Her sister is Labour MP Ellie Reeves. Parliamentary constituency: Leeds West and Pudsey\n\nPA Rachel Reeves with her sister Ellie Reeves, who is also a Labour MP\n\nAfter graduating, she took on a role as an economist at the Bank of England. She worked on the central bank's Japan desk, looking at the country's attempts to come out of stagnation in the 1990s. During a secondment to the UK's embassy in Washington DC, she met her future husband Nicholas Joicey, who had spent time as a film critic for newspapers and as a speechwriter to then-Chancellor Gordon Brown. The path to Parliament was not clear for Reeves though. There were two failed campaigns for the former seat of Bromley and Chislehurst, typically a safe one for the Conservatives. Before becoming an MP for Leeds West in 2010, she moved to Leeds and spent time working at the Halifax Bank of Scotland. On entering Parliament, she rose quickly up the ranks. She was awarded a number of key shadow roles and, according to political columnist Rachel Sylvester, was \"seen from the start as someone to be promoted\". One colleague said that she \"chews through calls and briefings\", before adding, \"I have never, ever, ever, seen her unprepared.\" Last December, Reeves spoke at the funeral of Alistair Darling, the former chancellor who served as a mentor when she was starting out. She spoke fondly of having lasagne and red wine with him and his wife, and of his counsel - he found himself in charge during a massive crisis when families and the country were having a hard time making ends meet.\n\nCriticisms\n\nWhile one of her friends has said she is politically \"as hard as nails\", her time in Westminster has not been without controversy. She has been accused of \"utter hypocrisy\" in the past for only offering students payments for expenses, rather than a full salary, while working in her office. Under Jeremy Corbyn, she spent time on the backbenches of the Commons because she felt she could not endorse his policies. Called a \"Red Tory\" by others in the party, she described this as a \"very unpleasant period\" in an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson. The former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was also forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her \"boring snoring\" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message. While she has said the incident was \"deeply humiliating\", her key aim during her time as shadow chancellor focused on portraying Labour as a steady economic hand and in her new role will continue to do so.\n\nGetty Images Rachel Reeves served as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury under Ed Balls (right), pictured in 2012\n\nReeves has said herself, however, that the party will inherit the worst economic situation since the aftermath of World War Two. She has pledged to accept the same fiscal rules that were used by the Conservatives: that the government should not borrow any more cash for day-to-day spending and to show that it is getting the country's debt down within five years. In the run-up to the general election, the party set out plans for a National Wealth Fund, which would see a Labour government stump up \u00a37bn to encourage private investment in green sectors, boosting productivity and the economy in turn. For Reeves and her staff, it is part of a big push to engage business in what has been dubbed a \"smoked salmon and scrambled egg\" offensive of breakfast meetings with senior business leaders. At the end of these meetings, whenever lavish pastries are left over, Reeves has admitted her team will ask permission from the hosts to take the leftovers back to their colleagues at the office. Living out her \"no waste\" values in practice may prove to be more challenging now she has taken office and the full extent of the challenges ahead become clear.",

        "body": "Labour must act now to reboot the economy\n\n2 days ago By Faisal Islam , @faisalislam, Economics editor Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nLabour\u2019s remarkable landslide provides a one-off opportunity to reboot and transform the British economy. The incoming chancellor and prime minister know this, and I have been told that it is what they intend to achieve in office. Rachel Reeves told me she was seeking a \u201cmandate for growth\u201d. They believe that they have won this election with a message of political and economic stability after years of chaos. Liz Truss\u2019 mini-budget loomed large in the minds of key swing voters, who got their feet on the property ladder in the period of near-zero interest rates, and voted for the Conservatives under former Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nThose newbuild housing estates, in every constituency - \u201cBarratt Home Britain\u201d - turned red. This underpins the incoming chancellor\u2019s \u201ciron clad\u201d commitment to keep borrowing, and interest rates, under control. \u201cStability first\u201d is the mantra. But they have also privately been told by former Downing Street residents and by some captains of industry that \u201cstability, while welcome, is not enough\u201d.\n\nWhile the Labour manifesto set out a mission and very broad strategy behind a stronger economy, it was not a detailed transformative plan. For example, public net investment is still set to be cut from current levels. The big criticism of Ms Reeves' vision of what she calls \u201csecurinomics\u201d - a new model of economics where the government does more to prepare for the private sector to make massive investments in green industry - was a lack of money. It is an attempt to emulate what US President Joe Biden is doing by investing by spending billions in new subsidies via loans and tax breaks targeted at green energy and vehicles. Labour's plan is basically \"Bidenomics without the cash\", critics say. But Labour leaders have been reassured that there is a tidal wave of private investment - hundreds of billions by the end of the parliament - waiting to be made, if there is political, economic and policy certainty. But they need to act with speed to secure it. Some key investors say they cannot wait another year for ponderous reviews of planning or energy policy, for example. Tens of billions in renewable investment, for example, is held up in planning disputes and a decade-long wait for a connection to the National Grid. This, Ms Reeves told me, had led to \u201can effective moratorium on building the cheapest forms of energy\u201d.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBut there is some intrigue as to whether in government, Sir Keir Starmer and Ms Reeves will now boldly face down opposition, on house building or key net zero transition measures. If it\u2019s going to work in transforming the economy quickly, it\u2019s going to have to hurt some people. There are a number of immediate challenges in the public finances. Further bankruptcies of councils and universities need to be dealt with. Shadow ministers report being staggered by the number of working families who are distraught about provision of special needs education, which has suffered from council cuts. While Labour ruled out raising the main rates of tax, there are other taxes that could rise in an Autumn Budget. The work on that and a spending review will start very quickly. More happily for many consumers and the public finances, the Bank of England could finally start to cut rates on 1 August. An imaginative approach to strict public finance rules that allowed more upfront useful investment could prove irresistible.",

Vistry, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Berkeley all finished the day between 2-3% higher on the back of Labour\u2019s plans to build new homes. During the election campaign, Labour focused largely on tackling housing supply, with a promise to build 1.5 million homes over the next parliament. The party has pledged to reform the planning system, although some have warned that doing so will not be easy.\n\nWill the walk match the talk?\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, new Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that planning reform was \"front and centre\" of Labour's plan to grow the economy. In order to build the 1.5 million homes and the energy infrastructure that Labour has committed to, \"we need to change how our planning system works - speed it up, stop the bureaucracies that are tying up investments in red tape,\" she said. Labour has also said it will allow development on lower-quality areas in the green belt, dubbed the \"grey belt\". Analysts RBC Capital Markets said in a note that they would be watching to see if the new government's \"walk matches its talk\". \"In the very short term we suspect that the talk alone will be enough to lift share prices,\" RBC said. However, Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said overhauling the planning system is likely to be a \"gradual and tortuous process\". The share price rise comes as the UK's biggest mortgage lender Halifax said mortgage costs are still the biggest challenge facing homebuyers and those coming to the end of fixed-term deals However, the squeeze caused by higher interest rates is likely to ease gradually as incomes rise and house price growth remains subdued, said Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax. According to the lender's latest figures, the average UK house price was relatively flat in June, falling by 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price in the UK stood at \u00a3288,455 last month, the Halifax said, edging down from \u00a3288,931 in May. Prices were up 1.6% from a year earlier, echoing recent figures from the Nationwide building society.

Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the \u201cflying piano\u201d because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.\n\nAerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft\u2019s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls \u201ca combination of gliding and surfing\u201d. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350\u2019s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn.\n\nAirbus Airbus has experimented with flying a jet in the wake of another to conserve fuel\n\nMr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years\u2019 experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon\u2019s drone delivery project, on the basis that \u201cthere has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft\". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.\n\nAerolane Aerolane hopes that a glider something like this might one day carry air freight\n\nMr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged outside advisors to be devil\u2019s advocates,\" he adds. He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots. James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something. \u201cIt stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.\u201d However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely. \u201cIt should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.\u201d\n\nFred Lopez Fred Lopez was initially sceptical about Aerolane's prospects",

        "title": "Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?",
        "body": "Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?\n\n2 days ago By Tom Singleton , Technology reporter Share\n\nAmazon\n\nThree decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of \"fulfilment centres\", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. \"For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',\" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. \"It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,\" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by \"living in a cave\".\n\nGetty Images Amazon has used sport to grow its streaming business\n\nSo the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over \"severe\" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: \"What the heck is left?\" \"Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?\" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to \"keep taking swings\" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a \"whole graveyard of bad ideas\" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention \"in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century\", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. \"Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,\" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziuk\u0117nas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. \"It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images Shein and Temu are two of the brands from China that are competing with Amazon",

        "title": "Chinese electric car makers hit with new European Union tariffs",
        "body": "EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs\n\n3 days ago By Jo\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\n\nGetty Images MG owner SAIC is one the car makers hardest hit by the new tariffs\n\nThe European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China\u2019s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by \"unfair subsidisation\", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU\u2019s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: \"I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46.\" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs.\n\nWinners and losers\n\nThey were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. \"The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,\" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: \"I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty.\" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU. That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will \"give the automaker an advantage in the European market\". Lu\u00eds Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because \"other brands would also be affected\".\n\nPortuguese executive Lu\u00eds Filipe Costa chose a BYD Seal over Western brands\n\nGeely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will \"still export to the EU profitably\" but \"its profits will be significantly reduced.\" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs. Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. \"Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,\" Mr Koopmann says. \"If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision.\"\n\nLocalising production\n\nWhile some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit \"will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,\" Rhodium says. \"The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault.\" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. \"It\u2019s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,\" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. \"The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.\"",

        "body": "Noise and steam as first blast furnace closes in Port Talbot\n\n3 days ago By Huw Thomas , BBC Wales business correspondent Share\n\nConstruction Photography/Avalon The last molten iron will be tapped from Blast Furnace 5 this week\n\nLoud noises and large plumes of steam will be visible above the Port Talbot steelworks as one of its historic furnaces is closed down by Friday. Blast Furnace 5 (BF5) had been operating since 1959, but will shut as part of Tata Steel UK\u2019s restructure. Port Talbot\u2019s other furnace will end production of liquid iron in September ahead of the construction of a greener electric arc furnace next year. Nearby residents have been warned about the sights and sounds connected to the cooling of BF5.\n\nTata Steel UK The furnace had undergone major rebuilding and renovation works to keep operating\n\nTata Steel UK Blast Furnace 5 in 1958, a year before it began producing liquid iron\n\nEarlier this week, engineers began altering the raw ingredients that are poured into the blast furnace in order to prepare for decommissioning. Plumes of steam and some whooshing sounds were expected to be heard ahead of the final tapping of liquid iron on Thursday evening or Friday morning. When the furnace began life in May 1959, it produced 11,800 tonnes a week, peaking in 2009 when it was producing more than 57,000 tonnes a week. Tragedy struck in November 2001 when an explosion killed three steelworkers and severely injured 12 others. Tonnes of molten iron burst from the furnace as the explosion lifted the top of the massive structure into the air. A report blamed the cause of the disaster on water that had come into contact with hot materials in the furnace.\n\nFamily photos Stephen Galsworthy, Andrew Hutin and Len Radford died in the 2001 explosion\n\nThe explosion claimed the lives of Stephen Galsworthy, who was 25, Andrew Hutin, 20, and Len Radford, 53. A \u00a365m rebuilding of the furnace, and upgrades since, had allowed it to continue producing the liquid iron required for Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks. Its closure comes amid a vast restructure of Tata Steel UK\u2019s operations. While BF5 will close this week, Blast Furnace 4 will shut in September and will end Port Talbot\u2019s ability to produce liquid iron from ore. Around 2,800 staff from Tata\u2019s 8,000 workforce will lose their jobs.\n\nHistory of Blast Furnace 5\n\nMay 1959 - The hearth for Blast Furnace 5 is \"blown-in\" to begin producing molten iron\n\n- The hearth for Blast Furnace 5 is \"blown-in\" to begin producing molten iron 1960 - BF5 is producing 11,800 tonnes a week, and is one of 27 blast furnaces in the UK\n\n- BF5 is producing 11,800 tonnes a week, and is one of 27 blast furnaces in the UK 1973-74 - BF5 is relined and enlarged, producing 23,000 tonnes a week\n\n- BF5 is relined and enlarged, producing 23,000 tonnes a week November 2001 - Explosion that killed three men\n\n- Explosion that killed three men 2002 - \u00a365m rebuilding of the damaged furnace\n\n- \u00a365m rebuilding of the damaged furnace 2009 - Iron production hits a record of 57,249 tonnes a week\n\n- Iron production hits a record of 57,249 tonnes a week 2018 - Life extension project to keep the furnace running until 2026\n\n- Life extension project to keep the furnace running until 2026 2024 - Tata Steel announces it will close both BF5 and the younger BF4 this year\n\nA worker in the neighbouring Blast Furnace 4 which will close in September\n\nTata Steel UK Tata Steel's restructure will replace the two blast furnaces with an electric furnace that melts scrap steel",

        "body": "'Airport parking firms left us out of pocket'\n\n3 days ago By Clodagh Stenson , BBC South Investigations \u2022 Alex Bish , BBC South East Investigations Share\n\nKim Renyard Kim Renyard said she had not been fully reimbursed by the parking firm she used\n\nHolidaymakers say they have been left hundreds of pounds out of pocket after using two meet-and-greet car parking firms at Gatwick, the UK's second largest airport. One passenger said she had to get a taxi nearly 150 miles home to Norfolk after Drive Park and Fly told her they could not find her car key when she arrived at the West Sussex airport. Meanwhile, a Galaxy Parking Limited customer said he was charged six pounds each time his car entered and exited the Gatwick drop-off zone while he was on holiday. The BBC has contacted both firms - which are not connected to Gatwick Airport - multiple times for a comment, but they are yet to respond.\n\nWest Sussex Trading Standards said it had received 199 complaints about a number of parking operators since 2022/23. Kim Renyard said that when she tried to pick her car up, Drive Park and Fly said her keys \u201chad been lost or misplaced\u201d. She said she spent hundreds of pounds on a taxi to Norfolk, on the understanding her car would be dropped to her home once the company had cut new keys. Although the firm said they had cut a new key, she said her old set was returned with the car. \u201cI actually do not know what they did with my car while it was in their care,\u201d Ms Renyard said. She said she had not received any money and was more than \u00a3300 out of pocket, despite being told by Drive Park and Fly that she would be fully reimbursed.\n\nWhen Richard Bowyer returned from his holiday he said the parking firm initially could not find his car\n\nRichard Bowyer said he returned from a family holiday to be told that Drive Park and Fly had \u201cno recollection\u201d of having his car. He booked into a hotel, but with his car still missing the next morning, he had to take a taxi home to Hampshire, costing him about \u00a3400. A week later he said his car was found in the short stay car park, in the exact spot where he had handed it over to a company representative.\n\nAnother holidaymaker, Leon Palma, from Southampton, booked a meet-and-greet with Galaxy Parking Limited. But he said his holiday was interrupted when he received a series of automatically emailed receipts showing his car had entered and left the Gatwick Drop-Off zone six times during the same morning, when he was abroad, at a cost of six pounds each time. Mr Palma said: \u201cIt stressed my holiday, because I\u2019m thinking if anything happens to my car, I\u2019ll get the blame because I am the owner.\" West Sussex Trading Standards said it had received 13 complaints about Galaxy Parking Limited this year and nine relating to Drive Park and Fly since December.\n\nRichard Sargeant from Trading Standards said passengers need to thoroughly check reviews before booking their airport parking\n\nWest Sussex Trading Standards manager Richard Sargeant said we have had issues with different operators for a number of years. \"We've had instances where cars are driven outside the compounds, cars left at supermarket car parks, and customers cars have had speeding tickets. \"This year we have seen customers vehicles being left at the short stay car park and when they return their car hasn't moved at all and the customer has to pay money to get their car released from the car park itself.\" He said people should always look for a \"buy with confidence approved trader\" who has been vetted by trading standards.\n\nNatasha Ferdinand discovered a fine was clocked up by her car while she was away\n\nNatasha Ferdinand, from Somerset, said she thought her experience with Drive Park and Fly had gone smoothly until she was hit with a fine for parking in a no-stopping zone. \u201cThe issue was that the parking meet-and-greet people parked it there, not us\u201d, Ms Ferdinand said. She said she tried to get Drive Park and Fly to cover the \u00a3100 penalty but its staff \u201ceither put the phone down or ignored my emails\".\n\nOliver Bedford, head of car parking at Gatwick Airport, which is not connected to Drive Park and Fly or Galaxy Parking Limited, said passengers needed to do their research. He told the BBC: \"Although there are lots of legitimate companies off-airport and the official Gatwick parking, there are some firms who are not operating in a right and proper manner.\" He said people should be \"extra careful\" looking on comparison websites\" at providers and check their details. \"Do they have independent reviews? Make sure that what you are booking is fully trustworthy,\" he said.",

On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: \"We have won the war on floppy disks!\"\n\nMr Kono has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would \"get rid of the fax machine\".\n\nOnce seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change.\n\nFor instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.\n\nThe announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a \"symbol of an anachronistic administration\".\n\n\"The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,\" read another comment on X.\n\nOthers comments were more nostalgic. \u201cI wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nCreated in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.\n\nA three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information.\n\nSony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.\n\nAs part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.\n\nBut Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.\n\nMany Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.\n\nPeople are moving away from those stamps at a \"glacial pace\", said local newspaper The Japan Times.\n\nAnd it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",

        "body": "Ex-Post Office chair denies hiding key Horizon report\n\n4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nPost Office Horizon IT Inquiry\n\nFormer Post Office chair Tim Parker has denied deliberately hiding a key report he commissioned into the Horizon IT system from members of the Post Office board. The 2016 report, written by former top Treasury lawyer Jonathan Swift, raised concerns about the accounting software which was later found to be faulty. Incorrect data from Horizon led to the wrongful conviction of 700 sub-postmasters for theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015. On Wednesday, an inquiry into the scandal heard that only four copies of the Swift report were made, none of which were shared with the Post Office board or the government. Mr Parker said he had been acting on advice from Post Office lawyers not to share the document.\n\n\"It's one of my regrets that I got this advice and I took it,\" he said. \"Could we have shared it? I wish we had, in a way. \"I've had this report commissioned, I wanted to get some kind of result from it, but then I get this advice.\"\n\nAll subpostmaster convictions have now been quashed, but many people went to prison or lost their businesses. The Swift report was commissioned by the government following a BBC Panorama programme in 2015 that raised concerns about the strength of evidence against those convicted. Although supportive of the Post Office in parts, it raised key concerns about whether the Post Office had enough evidence to bring charges of theft. It also cast doubt over claims that Horizon data could not be altered remotely by Fujitsu, the company that developed the software. This turned out to be untrue, and may have deprived subpostmasters of an important line of defence at their trials. Mr Parker, who became chair of the Post Office in October 2015, and remained in the role until September 2022, told the inquiry that top Post Office lawyer Jane MacLeod had advised him not to share the Swift report because it was legally privileged. That meant it had the same confidential status as communications between a lawyer and a client. Mr Parker said he was told that breaching this could have resulted in the report being made public, and that it needed to be kept within the \"tightly knit\" Post Office legal team.\n\n'I had no vested interest in protecting the Post Office'\n\nWhen challenged by inquiry lead counsel Jason Beer, Mr Parker conceded that by doing this he had prevented the board from discussing the report's findings. However, he said he believed that the Post Office legal team would \"take forward\" the report's recommendations and denied hiding it for improper motives. \"What possible motive would I have had at the time from hiding this report from my fellow board members, other than receiving advice that I shouldn't share it?\" he said. \"Bear in mind I had no axe to grind on this, I had no vested interest in trying to protect the Post Office.\" He continued: \"With hindsight of course, it would appear there were motives perhaps underpinning some of the advice or direction of this that were not wholly fair or right or in the interests of people who'd be wronged. \"At the time, however, it seemed to me that the people giving me advice... were doing this in good faith and it was the right thing to do.\" In later questioning, lawyer Sam Stein said as chair Mr Parker had been \"part time\" and his decisions had been \"part baked\". Mr Parker initially worked one and a half days per week on his Post Office responsibilities, and later dropped this down to half a day per week. But Mr Parker rejected Mr Stein's characterisation, saying: \"I don\u2019t accept that. I gave sufficient time and attention to the Post Office. I\u2019m sorry.\"",

        "body": "Water firms could be sued over sewage after ruling\n\n4 days ago By Lora Jones , BBC Business Share\n\nGetty\n\nWater companies could face a \"flood\" of legal challenges over sewage discharges, lawyers have said, after a landmark Supreme Court ruling. On Tuesday, seven justices at the UK's highest court ruled that the Manchester Ship Canal Company is able to sue United Utilities over the alleged release of raw sewage into the canal. Speaking to the BBC, one lawyer said owners of adjacent waterways or even members of the public could bring claims against other utility companies as a result. Environmental charities said the ruling was good news. It comes at a time when water companies have been under significant financial pressure and scrutiny for unauthorised discharges of waste. The panel of judges found that the Manchester Ship Canal Company was entitled to bring a nuisance or trespass claim for compensation over the release of \"untreated foul water\". It comes despite previous rulings to the contrary in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal, which led to the private company's appeal.\n\nGetty Images Sewage is discharged from overflow points across England\n\nThere are about 100 United Utilities outfalls along the canal, where treated waste is released from the sewerage network. Raw sewage is also dumped when the system is operating over capacity, something the judges said could be avoided if the firm \"invested in improved infrastructure and treatment\". A lengthy legal battle took place between the canal company, owned by the Peel Group, and United Utilities. The water provider argued that only regulators could take action over the spills, with the original 1991 act that privatised the sector providing it with protection. But Paul Greatholder, partner at law firm Russell Cooke, said that the ruling on Tuesday meant the \"floodgates are open\". \"This could bring a range of potential claims from either the owners of adjacent waterways, or even from members of the public who have been made unwell as a consequence,\" he said. Emily Nicholson, partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya said: \"If millions of copycat claims then spring up, that will be a reflection of the utility companies' failures rather than the failure of the courts or legal system.\" She said that those affected by any failures, such as swimmers, fishermen and environmental organisations, now at least have a route to seek redress. Mr Greatholder also suggested that the Supreme Court had put down a \"marker\" for water utility companies in claiming that issues could have been avoided if more investment had gone into improving the canal's infrastructure. \"No doubt the same could be said of all water companies. Thames Water has spent billions of pounds on a \u2018supersewer\u2019 running through London to try to mitigate just this sort of issue,\" he added. Water firms including Thames Water have come under significant scrutiny over their environmental records in recent months. Recent BBC analysis found that every major English water company had reported data suggesting they've discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry - a practice which is potentially illegal. On Tuesday, United Utilities said it \"understood and shared\" concerns about the need to improve, and pointed to a \u00a33bn investment plan aimed at cutting pollution by improving infrastructure.",

        "title": "Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?",
        "body": "Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?\n\n3 days ago By MaryLou Costa , Business reporter Share\n\nHannu Rauma Hannu Rauma says that using AI to help him manage has \"added years to my life\"\n\nWith the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll, Hannu Rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated. \u201cI was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams, and feeling this disappointment,\u201d says Mr Rauma, who is based in Vancouver, Canada. He is a senior manager at a company called Student Marketing Agency, which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses. \u201cWhen I was bringing new clients on board, half of my mind would be saying, \u2018we're going to screw up\u2019, and it would dampen my enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Rauma says that all changed from last November, when the firm began using an autonomous AI manager developed by US-based company Inspira. The AI manager helps the agency\u2019s employees, who work flexible hours remotely, to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance. It checks their timekeeping, sends them deadline reminders and regular check-in messages, and records the time spent on different clients, so the latter can be billed accurately. The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone\u2019s work progress in a central portal. Mr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. \u201cI'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,\u201d he says. Mr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. \u201cBefore, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we\u2019re able to have more light-hearted discussions.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts. Participants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager. The AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas. Yet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success. Despite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.\n\nGetty Images Dell is one firm that has cut jobs in the face of the rise of AI\n\nWhile businesses like UPS, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake. \u201cThe middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,\u201d says the professor of management. \u201cThey're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching\u2026 all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.\u201d AI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines. AI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition. But companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,\u201d says Prof Thurman. \u201cYou want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.\u201d\n\nAI managers can also help people who have become \u201caccidental managers\u201d - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat. \u201cWe did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management. \u201cSome of them said they didn\u2019t like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn\u2019t know what was expected of them or if they were doing a good job,\u201d says Ms Rahman. \u201cYou'd assume that an AI manager would be built to give those correct instructions, to give complete transparency on the requirements, and the outcomes. People are likely to be more productive when they know what's expected of them.\u201d But an over-reliance on AI management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people, Ms Rahman warns. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for a business to tell their employees that they\u2019re introducing this brand new AI system that's going to completely manage them, then say, with the same face, that \u2018we care about your experiences in the workplace,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nJames Bore",

        "body": "How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple\n\n4 days ago By Zoe Kleinman , Technology editor Share\n\nGetty Images Under Jensen Huang's leadership Nvidia has seen its share price soar\n\nLife comes at you fast. Last month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world\u2019s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple. When this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience. As I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (\u00a32.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft. Two things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight. Microsoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene. Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom \u2013 and so far, it\u2019s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?\n\nThis year\u2019s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech. I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement. \u201cWe thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],\u201d she told me. \u201cBut with AI, we are throwing the dice again\u201d. She believes she\u2019s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in. That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It\u2019s a confidential event, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI. A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. \u201cMost stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,\u201d it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup\u2019s \u201cAI winners basket\u201d had fallen in value in 2024. Life comes at you fast indeed.\n\nGetty Images Anne Boden says that AI has completely shaken up the tech sector\n\n\u201cGiven how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,\u201d warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cJust like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.\u201d In 2023 you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI. My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches. \u201cI spend a lot of time saying \u2018\u2026 but that\u2019s not AI\u2019,\u201d he tells me. It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.\n\nSpeaking to the FT, Citi\u2019s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, \u201cjust saying AI 15 times isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore\u201d. In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that\u2019s just plain weird. And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now \u2013 early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,\u201d says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar. \u201cBusinesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill \u2013 the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.\u201d Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. \u201cThe bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,\u201d he says. But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon. \u201cEveryone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,\u201d he adds. \u201cAll the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.\u201d\n\nGetty Images ChatGPT is the AI app that has really caught the public's attention",

        "title": "The fastest data in the world",
        "body": "The fastest data in the world\n\n5 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nsurf Mission accomplished for Edwin Verheul (left) and Joachim Opdenakker\n\nIn February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest science experiment \u2013 two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button. Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. \u201cThere was high-fiving involved,\u201d recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. \u201cIt was super-cool to see.\u201d He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands. A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) \u2013 or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists\u2019 access to the results of LHC experiments. A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable. \u201cThis transponder that Nokia uses, it\u2019s like a celebrity,\u201d says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. \u201cWe had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.\u201d This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still \u2013 they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.\n\nNokia & Surf After its upgrade the Large Hadron Collider will produce five times as much data\n\nIn labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection. This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster. The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. \u201cDue to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,\u201d explains Mr Opdenakker. Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data \u2013 about one petabyte per second. That\u2019s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs. This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today. \u201cThe upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,\u201d says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.\n\nA time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That\u2019s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work. In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors. He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores \u2013 a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people\u2019s home to the internet.\n\nBut older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That\u2019s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection. \u201cI think it\u2019s a world best, we don\u2019t know of any results that are better than that,\u201d says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line. For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself. Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030. But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. \u201cFor remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles\u2026 you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,\u201d says Mr Creaner. Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues. And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: \u201cHumanity finds a way of consuming it.\u201d\n\nTeleGeography Demand for bandwidth is growing surprisingly fast says Lane Burdette",
